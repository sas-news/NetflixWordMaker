What if it was?

173
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,520
Are you jealous?

-[boys] Ooh!

175
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
[boy] I'm not gay.

Nah, leave 'em alone, lads. Come on.

177
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,680
Come on. You've got your own problems.

178
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,680
Did Harry just stick up for us?

179
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,440
[Harry] Hey! Come on! [laughs]

180
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,760
I think he did.

181
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,480
Weird.

182
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,160
Maybe we shouldn't
be hanging out right now.

183
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,920
More people might think
it was you who… you know.

184
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,840
You, um…

185
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,200
You do know

186
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,440
it was me, right?

187
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
-Yeah, I think I remember you being there.
-Yeah?

188
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,160
-Yeah.
-Good.

[Tao] This is cute.

196
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,320
You could get one if you want.
They're selling them back there.

197
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
You really don't think
things are gonna work out?

198
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,800
Even if she does like me back,
and even if something did happen,

199
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,720
I'd still mess it up,
like I always do with everything.

200
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,000
You don't mess things up.
Name one thing you've messed up.

201
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,120
The cinema date?

202
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,200

204
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
How?

205
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,400
Charlie,

206
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,840
I'm basically the reason
you got outed last year.

207
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,760
After you came out to us, I was talking
about you with Isaac, someone overheard,

208
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,640
and, next thing we know,
you're getting bullied every single day.

209
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,520
I never wanted to tell you
because I didn't want you to hate me.

210
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,960
But you know
that wasn't your fault, don't you?

211
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,160
Like, that was clearly an accident.

212
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,760
Tao, we've been friends
since the first day of Year 7.

213
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,720
Hey. I'm Tao.

214
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,560
-Charlie.
-Cool.

215
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,640
-Do you like Radiohead?
-Yeah.

216
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,400
Me too. Have you seen
the <i>Romeo + Juliet </i>movie from the '90s?

217
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,840
It's one of my favorite movies,

218
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,960
and it's got a Radiohead song
on the credits.

219
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,240
It makes me cry, like, every time.

220

[present Charlie] <i>I was so shy</i>
<i>and scared of everyone,</i>

221
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,000
but I immediately thought
how cool and funny and kind you were.

222
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,720
You were the only person I met that day
that I really wanted to be friends with.

223
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,520
Are you guilt-tripping me
into being nice about myself?

224
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,800
Even if things don't work out
with you and Elle,

225
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,000
even if you make mistakes sometimes,

226
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,400
you're a good person who deserves love.

227
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,640
Wait, isn't that for you and Nick?

228
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,320
No.

229
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,720
People might think you gave me this hickey
if you keep this up.

230
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,000
So? Might help to deflect the rumors.

231
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,320
Guys, come on.
We need to get to the Louvre.

232
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,160
I'm gonna…

00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,800
-[Tao] Hey. Wait up.
-[Elle] You okay?

234
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,440
[Mr. Farouk] You have until 5:00 p.m.,

235
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,120
and if any of you gets lost,
we will be leaving you here

236
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,680
to get locked in.

237
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,600
[Mr. Ajayi] Okay?

238
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,600
-[Harry] Where's that <i>Mona Lisa </i>girl?
-Let's go!

239
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,640
Guys, we've gotta get a selfie with it.
Everyone pose for me now.

240
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,880
Wait! That's the <i>Mona Lisa</i>?

241
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,520
That's it? It's rubbish!

242
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,320
What? Darcy, it's art!

243
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,320
-You can't say that.
-Let's get another photo.

244

Look, look, look! Quick!
Show me your Mona face.

[Tara] Silly! [giggles]

246
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,280
I reckon I'd look absolutely great
in, like, a gilded, golden frame.

247
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,320
Stunning and glowing
and looking spectacular.

[laughter]

249
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,400
[Darcy] I'd be so incredibly mugged off
if I posed for a painting,

250
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,640

00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,560
I don't think I really understand
any of the art, but… it's nice to look at.

254
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,040
[Elle] You don't always need
to understand it to enjoy it.

255

This one feels kinda romantic.

256
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,360
-Yeah.
-Mm.

257
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,920
[Nick] Guess that's true
of real life as well.

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What is?

Like…

00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,440
You don't have to understand your feelings
completely to know you like something.

You don't have to always
have figured everything out.

262
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,680
You can just

263
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,760
feel.

-Come on!
-Wait, where are we going?

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
No idea!

-What are you looking at?

00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,320

No.

I think we're there 'cause I think it was…

so we're at that one, aren't we?

281

Which means that if we go up these stairs,
we can see the Greek sta… tues.

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,640
I should probably tell you,
when we were on the Eiffel Tower,

283
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,880
he said that he still liked you.

284
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,720
Like, he genuinely thinks he still has
a chance of getting back with you.

285
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,800
He doesn't. [chuckles]

286

Isn't it?

I don't know. Come on.

300
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,720
Why do you always do that?
Why do you always avoid the issue?

301
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,880
Sometimes, I feel like
you're hiding stuff from me.

Well, I'm not.

303

I've never met your parents,
I've never been to your house, and…

304
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,440
you didn't even wanna
say "I love you" back.

305
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,040
It was just a casual "I love you."

306
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,240
You said you didn't mean it like that.

307

But you know I did.

to make those statues so accurate.

Like, back in the day,
all they had was just a big bit of rock.

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,280
-And a carving tool. What would it be?
-[Isaac] Like a chisel.

312
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,920
-[Nick] A chisel.
-[Isaac] Yeah.

313
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,960
[Nick] But how did they do it
with just a chisel?

But… I think it's my favorite holiday yet.

Um… Generally.

I know I don't eat like normal people.

Some days I'm fine,
but other days I feel like I need to…

control it.

401
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,440
I used to do it a lot last year,
when everything at school was really bad.

the only thing I can control in my life.

Sort of. Um…

He's not really
a big part of my life anymore,

457
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,320
since he lives here, and…

458

he's not the most reliable.

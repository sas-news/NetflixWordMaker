No, his… His name's Nick.

Is my hair too short?

180
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,320
It looks the same.

181
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,320
But is it okay?

182
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,000
It looks the same.

183
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,520

Okay.

You've won five or six games.

I'm going easy on you.

202

-No!
-Yes! [laughs]

How are you so good at this?

205
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,440
You get to be good at real sports,
I get to be good at fake ones.

206
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,760
-No, you're just good at everything.
-No, I'm not.

-You are. You're a proper little nerd.
-I'm not.

208

Yes.

Well, I've kind of
been feeling like maybe he isn't.

271
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,680

the past weeks and during the half-term.

We've been hanging out non-stop,

275

a little bit flirty sometimes.

276
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,360
Obviously, I'm not getting my hopes up,
but I just think maybe there's a chance.

00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,520
What?

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,560

and I just don't want you to get hurt.

I decided to do
some digging over the half-term.

287
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,400
I messaged Otis, since I sort of know him,
and I know he's friends with Nick,

288
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,360
and I just slyly asked
if Nick was going out with anyone

289
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,920
because I might have
a friend who was interested.

290
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,160
He said that Nick's single,

291
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,320
but he's super interested
in this girl from the girls' school.

292
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,560
What girl?

293
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,640
Her name's Tara Jones.

As your token straight friend,

298
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,960
it's my duty to remind you
that sometimes people are straight.

299
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,200
It's an unfortunate fact of life.

300
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,560
[Isaac] We don't know
if she actually likes Nick back.

301
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,280
I've already warned you about encouraging
Charlie's crushes on straight boys.

302
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,280
But I want to believe in romance.
Elle! So there's this girl at Higgs

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,080
-who Nick's got a crush on?
-We've heard from multiple sources.

304
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,880
We don't know if they're a thing.
Can you talk to her?

305
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,360
Charlie won't give up on this straight boy
until we know for sure.

-Yeah.
-Can you ask her if she likes Nick Nelson?

00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,080
Nick Nelson?
You might as well give up right now.

I have ever seen.

I can't just go up to her
and ask her who she fancies.

315

being the cool, mysterious new girl

I'm fine. It's honestly fine.
I'm just being an idiot.

Okay. Look, if and only if
I get the chance,

319
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,800
I'll ask her.

Yes, I have a girlfriend.

00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,880

Hey.

Sorry. I'm definitely straight,

being friends if you feel like that.

353
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,800
What?

354
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,920
You just spaced out.

355
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,840
Oh.

356
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,640
What?

357
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,640
What's up?

358
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,440
Do you…

359
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,040
Do you want to come round my house?

00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,160
[chuckles softly]

361
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,080
-[Darcy] Knew it!
-[Tara] Said it in your head.

362
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,040
That doesn't count!

363
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,160
-[Darcy] It totally counts.
-[Tara] That completely doesn't count!

364
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,360
-You're rubbing off on me.
-You're worse.

365
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,280
[Tara] I'm not. It does matter
if you said it because I won,

366
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,080
-but then you said you won because…
-[Darcy] I did win!

367
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,200
[Tara] …you knew first,
but you didn't say it.

368
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,000
-[Darcy] I absolutely did!
-Um, hi.

369
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,360
[Darcy] I was just admiring Tara's hands.

370
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,920
Mine get super crusty
in the cold, but hers are really soft.

371
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,280
[scoffs] Darcy.

372
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,120
I'm sorry if I've got totally
the wrong idea here,

373
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,400
but are you two, like… dating?

374
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,400
Don't tell anyone, okay?

375
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,160
Only a few of our friends know,

376
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,000
but I think you're officially
part of the inner circle.

377
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,840
[Darcy and Tara chuckle]

378
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,000
Also, "hers are really soft,"

379
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,640
that's the gayest excuse
I've heard in my life.

380
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,360
You've befriended the school lesbians.

381

382
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Hey.

383
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,120
Hey.

384
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,200
[chuckling] You're terrible.

385
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,400
I'm trying.

386
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,880
Here, budge up, let me help.

388
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,160
There.

389
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,560
You're a pro now.

390
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,920
Um… [chuckles softly]

391
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,520
Well, that's probably cheating though.

392
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600

394
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,320
[Charlie] I wish you didn't have to go.

395
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,200
I wish I didn't either.

396
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,680
You look so cuddly like that.

397
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,920
Do I?

398
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,920
Yeah.

399
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,400
Um… [clears throat]

400
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,240
Okay, see you Monday.

00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,200

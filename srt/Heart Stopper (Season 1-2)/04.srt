Yeah, well, some girls
who are friends just do that.

202
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,840
Actually, when you think about it,
there are 1,200 people at this school,

203
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,520
so at least a few of them
are going to be lesbians.

and Nick are a thing,

the next I hear you're kissing
some girl at Harry's party.

Tara literally kisses
her girlfriend at a crowded party,

214
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,520
and people are still asking her
if she's dating a guy

215

-So that girl is her girlfriend?
-That girl? I'm right here!

are together, so I just needed to check.

-I'm a lesbian.

[breathing heavily]

355
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,920
[knock at door]

356
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,920
Hey.

357
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,560
Hey.

358
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,480
Is your nose okay?

359
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,400
I don't know.

360
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,560
Let me see.

361
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,080
It looks fine.

362
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,640
Cool.

363
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,920
You've got some mud on your face though.

364
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,440
[soft music playing]

365
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,680
Um, sorry… [chuckles nervously]

366
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,840
What?

367
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,440
I'm really sorry
for being all clingy and annoying.

368
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,800
I'm making this so awkward.

369
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,520
You wanted to keep us a secret
and I'm messing it up.

370
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,440
I'm the one who should be saying sorry.

371
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,160
[Isaac] Uh…

372
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,080
Sorry…

373
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,640
for, um…

374
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,720
interrupting, but Ms. Singh told me
to give you some… antiseptic wipes.

375
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,920
Okay.

376
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,400
[door opens and closes]

377
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,640
Um… [clears throat]

378
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,320
I'd better go.

379
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,880
Okay.

380
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,160
Isaac won't say anything.

381
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,880
Yeah.

382
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,240
Okay.

383
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
[door closes]

384
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,480
Charlie's not going to give up
on Nick Nelson, is he?

385
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,440
Highly doubt it.

386
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,480
[scoffs]

387
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,040
Maybe we should
just stop getting involved.

388
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,440
I can't believe
you just actually suggested that.

389
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,160
You, Tao Xu,
King of Getting Involved. [giggles]

390
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,400
Shut up.

391
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,040
-It was nice meeting your friends though.
-Yeah?

392
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,320
Yeah.

393
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,560
They seem cool.

394
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,520
They are.

395
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,960
Have they replaced us?

396
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,600
As if anyone could replace

397
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,840
your incredibly annoying,
loud presence in my life.

398
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,680
-[in deep voice] How dare you?
-[chuckles]

399
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,480
[Harry] Who you waiting for?

400
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,920
[Imogen] I was just waiting to see Nick.

401
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,360
-Oh. Finally ready to make a move?
-[girl] I know…

402
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,880
-Just piss off, Harry.
-[boys] Ooh!

403
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,440
Okay, fine. If you're gonna be
a coward about it.

404
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,000
[boys chuckling]

405
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,160
[boy] Ooh, feisty.

406
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,640
Oh. Hey.

407
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,600
Hey!

408
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,440
What's up?

409
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,120
You did so good.

410
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,240
Uh, I mean, the match was cancelled
and we were losing anyway, but…

411
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,440
Thanks.

412
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,400
So what's going on?

413
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,800
[Imogen] I…

414
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,920
[boys shushing]

415
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,840
I…

416
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,560
wanted to ask you if, um…

417
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,720
Like, this is really random.
[laughs nervously]

418
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,040
But maybe we could,
like… go out somewhere.

419
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,800
-[students exclaiming]
-Together.

420
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,120
Like, I guess sort of a… date.

421
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,560
Or something.

422
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,360
Oh. Um…

423
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,640
[Harry] Go on, Nick.

424
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,080
[all chuckling]

425
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,320
Yeah. I guess so, sure.

426
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,200
[Harry laughing] Yes, lad.

427
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,520
Lads, let's get out of here.

428
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,960
[Imogen giggles]

429
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,840

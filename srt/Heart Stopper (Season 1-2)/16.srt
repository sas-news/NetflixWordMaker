I just wanna have a fun night
with you and our friends.

Yeah, I want that too.

345
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,160
I mean, David and my mum are out tonight,
so… I do have a free house.

-[Charlie] You got the dance floor going.

[Nick] You were throwing
some serious shapes out there. Hey, Isaac.

-Hey, guys.
-[Charlie] Where'd you disappear to?

350
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,080
Hey. I thought prom
was supposed to be vampire themed?

351
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,080
Oh my God.

00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,640

-[Isaac] Where have you been?

Uh…

359

She said she was coming to our school prom
tonight, uh, but she didn't show up.

360
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,120
And she hasn't been replying
to my messages.

Do you know where she is?

365
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,240
She had another one
of her tantrums last night.

She looked like a lesbian.

00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,280
She'll realize she was in the wrong,
and she'll come straight back.

371
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,320
Okay.

372

It was fine. Nobody was there.

387
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,840
Why didn't you text me?

388
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,680
My phone was out of battery,
and I didn't have a charger.

Why didn't you walk to my house?

Because I didn't want you to know.

Yeah.

393
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,000
You told me

394
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,520
that you didn't feel as confident
about being a lesbian as I did,

395
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,480
and I wanted to be that person for you,
to help you through your journey.

But then you said, "I love you."

404
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,920
But… what if that person
doesn't even exist?

405
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,320
So… you were scared to say it back

406
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,040

that I could love you?

You went to rugby summer camp?

485
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,600
When I was 12.
I think I had a crush on the instructor.

486
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,320
[chuckles] Oh my God.

487
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,680
You know, I didn't realize it at the time,
but looking back now,

488
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,560
I was obsessed with him,
so I tried really, really hard

489
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,680
and, uh, got that trophy
for being the best team player.

490
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,600
That is so adorable!

00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,240

00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,000
Tell me something.

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,080

495
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,800
You never told me about…

496
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,840
the bullying.

497
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,560
What that was like.

498
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,040
We don't need to talk about that.

499
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,200
Everything's fine now.

500
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,960
Is everything fine?

501
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,240
I know you like everything to be fine
and happy and perfect all the time,

502
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,240
but you don't have to be perfect with me.

503
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,760
Charlie, we said
we'd tell each other things.

504
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,800
After you told me
about your… eating thing.

505
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,440
Someone just heard Tao
talking about me coming out.

506
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,880
I think it surprised me
how homophobic people were.

507
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,360
I thought things were better nowadays.

508
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,840
People would just
call me disgusting to my face.

509
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,520
And it went on for so long

510
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,120
that I think I started
to believe what they were saying.

511
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,080
It made me really hate myself.

512
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,400
So much that I…

513
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,880
I used to…

514
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,760
I used to cut myself sometimes.

515
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,960
I don't wanna feel like that anymore.

516
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,040

517
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,680
[Charlie] No.

00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,800
Sorry.

519
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,720
I thought we'd banned the S word.

520
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,120
Can you promise to tell me

521
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,560
if it ever gets that bad again?

522
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,120
I just don't wanna annoy you
or burden you.

523
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,120
I don't want you to think
I'm some fragile, broken mess.

524
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,400
Like you need to fix me.
I would hate that.

525
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,480
You're not, and I wouldn't.

526
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,400
But I've done so many things
that were scary in the past few months

527
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,240
because you were there, holding my hand.

528
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,560
And I wanna be that for you too.

529
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,640

you're my boyfriend.

Char,

532
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,080
can you just please,

533
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,880
please promise me?

534
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,760

I love your hair so much.

Nick. I really need to go.

538
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,000
I love your eyes.

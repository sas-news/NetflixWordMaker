Are they…

354
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,360
Are they not a girl?

355
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,040
Um…

356
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,320
Would you go out with someone
who wasn't a girl?

357
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,080
I don't know.

358
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,160
Maybe.

359
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,800
Would you kiss someone who wasn't a girl?

360
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,360
I don't know.

361
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
[crackling]

362
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
[whimsical music playing]

363
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,320
Would you kiss me?

364
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,720
Yeah.

365
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,440
[music continues]

366
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
You okay?

367
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,120
I…

368
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,440
[Harry] Nick, are you up here?

369
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,800
I just want to talk, mate.

370
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,400
Why are you hiding?

371
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,880
-[door opens]
-[rock music playing on speakers]

372
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,200
[door closes]

373
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,120
And like, it's all just banter, isn't it?

374
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,920
I mean, the lads can see it's banter.

375
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,200
You can see it's banter.

376
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,720
There's no need to start anything,

377
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,920
just 'cause you're in a bad mood
at my party.

378
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,840
Yeah.

379
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,600
Guess I was just in a mood.

380
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,280
Yeah. Exactly. [laughs]

381
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,480
So we're good?

382
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,280
Yeah.

383
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,680
Just going to go find the loo.

384
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,320
[laughter]

385
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,400
[whimsical music continues]

386
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,000
[Nick] Charlie.

387
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,520
Hey.

388
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,920
Hey, you okay?

389
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,960
[sobbing]

390
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,640
It's okay.

391
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,640
It's okay.

392
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,160
It's okay. I've got you.

393
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,200
I got you.

394
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,760
Everything's going to be okay.

395
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,320
[Charlie] <i>Would you kiss me?</i>

396
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,320
No.

397
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,160
[knocking at door]

398
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,520
[Charlie's mom] Charlie!
Can you get the door please?

399
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,920
It's probably the postman.

400
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,120
Fine, one sec.

401
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,040
[music continues]

402
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,160
Hi.

403
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,920
Hi.

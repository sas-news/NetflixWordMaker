Didn't you hear about
Harry Greene's fight with Nick and Tao?

10
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,760
Both my fault, by the way.

11

Yeah. I'm like 95% sure they were both
Harry's fault, and I wasn't even there.

he made me feel
like I was ruining his life.

17

Like he didn't want me to even exist.

18
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,320
And now Nick's lost all his friends,

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,600
and he's getting into fights
because of me.

20
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,560
And I just feel like

21
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,840
maybe I do just ruin people's lives.

22
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,280

is on Friday.

Why?

I thought he was eating with you.

-[Nick] Charlie avoiding you too?
-I'm avoiding him.

67
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,320
-Why?
-Because I'm pissed off with him.

68
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,160
Oh.

69
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,440
Charlie's my friend. I was worried
about him joining the rugby team

70
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,000
and becoming friends with you

71
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,760
because I knew that he'd get picked on
by some of the idiots in your year.

72
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,520
And guess what? He did.

73
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,240
I'm done trying to protect him
when he's forgotten I exist, like…

74
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,960
I deserve to be appreciated.

75
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,400
If he'd just told me
that you two were going out, like…

76
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,920
Maybe I would've done things differently.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,720
Maybe I would have stayed more low-key
and Harry would have left us alone.

78
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,840
I think Charlie might be nervous
about telling you

79
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,080
because he really cares
about your opinion.

80
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,240
Because he loves you a lot.

81
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,360
Yeah.

82
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,560
Well, I'll believe that
when I actually see it.

83
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,360
Why's he avoiding you?

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,520
I think maybe…

85
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,600
he's finding it hard having
to lie to people about us.

86
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,120
He's not angry about me being
in the closet or anything, like…

87
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,000
He knows I'm not ready to come out, but…

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,960
Look…

89
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,480
I've known Charlie since we were 11,

90
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,720
and he's always had a tendency
to believe that him just existing

91
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,280
is annoying for other people.

92
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,320
Yeah.

93
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,480
I sort of got that impression.

94
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,320
He's not going to force you
to come out. Which is good.

95
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,000
He would literally never tell you this,

96
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,280
but he probably wants to be something more

97
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,040
than "secret guy you kiss sometimes
on the down-low."

98
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,240
And if you can't give him
more than that then…

99
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,720
I mean, that's fine,

100
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,000
but it's always gonna make him feel
a little bit crap about himself.

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,760
Oh.

102
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,080
You should talk to him.

103

-Yeah, so should you.
-No.

104
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,760
I'm gonna stay pissed off
with him for a bit longer.

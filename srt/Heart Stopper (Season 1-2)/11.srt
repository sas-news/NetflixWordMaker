You really shouldn't
have picked that movie.

It's not my fave, but you love it, so…

349
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,080
But if we're going on a date,
we should do something we both enjoy.

350
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,160
My mum should be here
in, like, five minutes.

351
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,520
Still wanna go to this party?

352
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,880
Yeah. Sure.

353
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,680
Thanks for asking me out on a date.

354
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,480
Um… Thanks for saying yes.

I didn't know you invited them.

359
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,440
Yeah. They're my friends.

360
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,240
What?

361
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,920
I don't understand
what I did wrong tonight!

362
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,640
It's like you were trying to be
a completely different person.

363
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,800
You're the one who's completely different!

364
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,800
You've gone off with your new friends
and have forgotten I exist completely.

365
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,440
You're the one who said
we'd always put our friendship first.

366
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,040
You promised.

367
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,920
Well, I guess

How'd it go?

372
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,000
-Bad.
-Maybe he was just nervous.

373
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,600
I'm fundamentally unlikable.

374
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,080
Don't say that, Tao.

375
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,000
-He was probably trying to impress you.
-I liked the old Tao.

376
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,320
I try too hard, and I talk too much.

377
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,840
-I ruin everything.
-Tao, please don't say that.

378
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,680
I've liked him for so long,
and it just hurts.

Hi.

Sorry, um…

Where's Charlie?

I, um… I lost him. Sorry.

390

You said you'd look after him.

391

Not very good
at keeping your promises, are you?

392
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,800
You don't look well.

393
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,200
I'll find him.

I told you I was gonna come out, but…

I've just been finding it so hard.

453
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,320
You didn't promise anything.

454
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,600
I think there's this idea
that when you're not straight,

455
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,680
you have to tell
all your friends and family immediately.

456
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,640
Like you owe it to them.

Let's just stay low-key in Paris,

462
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,440
and then it'll be the summer holidays,
and we can just be us.

463
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,600
That does sound nice.

Obviously I want you to come out
when and how you want to.

that's completely okay.

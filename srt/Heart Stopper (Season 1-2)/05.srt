but he's really nice.

178
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,280
And you know Tao.

179
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,680
Sorry in advance if he says
anything rude to you.

180
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,840
That's just the way he is.

181
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,760
[Nick] Okay.

182
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,400
Ready to meet them?

183
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,320
Yeah.

184
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
[Charlie] Everyone,

185
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,840
this is Nick.

186
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,040
-Hey.
-[Isaac] Hey.

187
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,960
Oh, good. We're just choosing
fun names for the board.

188
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,200
Fun names?

189
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,640
Yeah, and for the record,
Elle Smells was Tao's idea.

190
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,280
Can you at least try to get to know him?

191
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,760
I'll… try.

192
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,160
["Buzzkill" playing]

193
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,440
-That's close.
-Oh, no!

194
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,679
[exclaims]

195
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,120
What are you doing?

196
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,760
That's it! I'm not doing it anymore.

197
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,400
No more, no more, no more.

198
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,600
-Yes! Come on!
-[Charlie] You did it!

199
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,080
Sorry.

200
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,200
-Why are these chips so good?
-They're so good.

201
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,320
[all yelling]

202
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,880
-Oh, yeah.
-[grunts]

203
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,560
[Nick] Yes!

204
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,360
I was so close.

205
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,720
You definitely cheated.

206
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Oh, yeah? How?

207
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,360
You have strong rugby arms.

208
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,400
[Nick] Strong rugby arms?

209
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,880
-You okay?
-Yeah. Yeah. I'm good.

210
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,680
You've got an unfair advantage.

211
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,400
I thought you liked my arms.

212
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,680
Shut up.

213
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,720
Is everyone ready for a round two?

214
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,520
I'm just going to go find the bathroom.

215
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,440
I'm going to go talk to him.

216
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,360
About?

217
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,520
Tao. Tao, no. It's his birthday.

218
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,480
I have to.

219
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,440
Charlie.

220
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,640
Oh.

221
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,560
Hi.

222
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,360
Charlie, look.
I'm saying this to you as a friend.

223
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,080
You need to stop this thing
with Nick Nelson.

224
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,000
What?

225
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,240
He's going on a date with this girl.

226
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,120
I heard him agree to it
after that rugby match the other week.

227
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,880
That can't be true.

228
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,800
[Tao] Fine.

229
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,760
Don't believe me.
I'm clearly just lying for fun.

230
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,560
I'm going to go and get some chips.
Do you guys want anything?

231
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,680
Oh, can you get me a Coke?

232
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,040
-I'll pay.
-[Nick] No, I'll get it.

233
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,160
-Okay.
-Isaac?

234
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,680
I'll also accept a can of Coke.
If you're paying.

235
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,720
Okay, all right. I'll be back in a minute.

236
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,080
Thanks.

237
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,760
[pop song playing on speakers]

238
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,600
[Tao] You know
he's just an attention-seeker

239
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,520
like Harry and the rest of his mates!

240
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,840
[Charlie] Nick doesn't even like Harry.

241
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,680
Nick's basically risking everything
by hanging out with me, so--

242
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,960
Wow. I feel so sorry
for the popular rugby lad

243
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,320
who's almost getting picked on

244
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,560
because he dares to hang out
with someone below his popularity status.

245
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,000
You know that's not what I meant.

246
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,920
Now you're going to tell me
I'm being jealous

247
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,200
because you made a friend
and I'm scared of being alone?

248
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,360
Well…

249
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,520
Aren't you?

250
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,440
No!

251
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,200
I just don't like
seeing him mess with you.

252
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,440
[Charlie] Do you really think
he's messing me around?

253
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,800
[Tao] I mean, that's what it looks like.

254
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,360
But…

255
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,640
He's…

256
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,040
He's…

257
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,120
my

258
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,120
friend.

259
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,640
[Tao] Fine.

260
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,320
But if he is even slightly mean to you…

261
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,240
Yeah.

262
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,240
You'll murder him. I know.

263
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,920
I was going to say
I'd send him a strongly worded DM,

264
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,040
but murder's fine too.

265
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,160
[chuckles]

266
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,960
Ugh!

267
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,280
Just go.

268
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
Hi.

269
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,360
Hi.

270
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,560
Are you getting more food?

271
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,680
[whimsical music playing]

272
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,880
[indistinct chatter]

273
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,160
[Charlie] I believe in you.

274
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,280
Yes! I win, I win!

275
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,800
Why am I so bad?

276
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,480
Uh, well, your arms are basically twigs.

277
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,720
Ah! How dare you?
I'm a very muscular individual.

278
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,040
You wish.

279
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,920
-How did you do that?
-I don't know.

280
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,200
-You're really good at it.
-[Elle] Thank you.

281
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,040
[Elle speaking indistinctly]

282
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,760
Good game.

283
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,720
Good game.

284
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,720
Chip?

285
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,600
Thanks.

286
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,000
I don't know if this thing
with Charlie is a joke,

287
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,080
but for some reason, he really likes you,
and you're messing with him.

288
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,120
And I will not tolerate it,
so consider this your final warning.

289
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,200
Yeah.

290
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,320
You're right.

291
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,720
You're a good friend.

292
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,600
I know.

293
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,680
[Elle] Oh, my God,
what about the dance machine?

294
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,880
I'm so scared of it.

295
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,680
-[Elle] Well, what do you want to play?
-I don't know.

296
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,520
[Elle] Do we have to run?

297
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,520
Yes, before someone occupies
the dance machine.

298
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,360
[Nick] Okay, come on. Come on, come on.

299
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,040
-What?
-[Charlie laughing]

300
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,560
[Nick] I'm almost out of money now.

301
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,240
Don't look at me. I'm not giving you
more just so you can lose again.

302
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,200
Fine, I see how it is.

303
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,680
[both laughing]

304
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,280
So, I, um…

305
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,000
I kind of overheard you and Tao
in the bathroom earlier.

306
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,200
Oh.

307
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,360
I wanted to say sorry

308
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,040
about the date with Imogen thing.

309
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,680
You actually went on a date with her?

310
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,120
No, no.

311
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,040
She just asked me out
and I was so surprised,

312
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,760
and all our mates were watching
and expecting me to say "yes"

313
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,520
and I was such an idiot,
I just blurted out "yes"

314
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,920
because I didn't know how to say "no"

315
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,400
without embarrassing her
and confusing all our mates.

316
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,800
And then her dog died.

317
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,880
And I felt really bad for her and…

318
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,240
I'm so sorry.

319
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,080
Isn't that what
you always tell me not to say?

320
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,800
Yeah, but…

321
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,320
I've actually done something bad.

322
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,840
Well, it's not like we're… you know…

323
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,440
officially dating or anything.

324
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,600
I'm going to make it right
with Imogen, I'm gonna…

325
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,760
tell her I don't like her like that.

326
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,440
Okay.

327
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,840
I wish I'd met you when I was younger.

328
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,800
-Yeah?
-Mmm.

329
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,600
I wish I'd…

330
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,400
known then what I know now.

331
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,360

[chuckles]

333
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,120
So, are you going to open my present then?

334
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,680
Yeah. As long as you don't mind.

335
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,360
Well, I kind of want to see your reaction.

336
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,520
I genuinely didn't have time to go out
and buy you something.

337
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,240
So…

338
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,400
Sorry it's a bit handmade.

339
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,840
That was just one of
my favorite days ever, so…

340
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,160
I really like you.

341
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,680
You like me?

342
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,880
Wasn't that obvious? [chuckles]

343
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,358
Do you like me?

344
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,598
Yes! Obviously.

345
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,358
Why are we like this?

346
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,079
I want to kiss you so bad right now.

347
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,920
Okay.

348
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,720
You don't have to.

349
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,760
I want to.

350
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,800
Are you sure?

351
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,240
Yeah.

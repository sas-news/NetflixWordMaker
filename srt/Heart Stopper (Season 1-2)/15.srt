-[Charlie's dad] Hi.

356
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,680
I grew up
in the south of France. Near Narbonne.

357
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,480
Ah, yeah, yeah. Very near Spain.

358
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,840
My father's from the south of Spain.
Almería.

359
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,840
[Stéphane] Oh yeah.

360
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,400
-But your surname, it's so English.
-[Charlie's dad] Yeah, well…

361
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,240
Um… He always said that we had a rather
complicated family tree. [chuckles]

362
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,880
-[Charlie's mom] It's a long story.
-[Charlie's dad] Yeah.

363
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,000
-Do you visit often, Stéphane?
-As much as I can.

364
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,680
My job, it keeps me very busy.

[Stéphane] No, he hasn't.

372
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,160
Um… We got sat together in school,
and then Charlie joined the rugby team.

373
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,880
Oh. You play rugby, Charlie?

374

[Charlie's mom] Mm.

376
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,760
And Nick was obsessed
with getting Charlie to join.

377
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,360
Wonder why.

378
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,320
-What is your problem?
-I played rugby when I was in university.

379

It's a very attractive sport to women.

380

Have neither of you boys
found girlfriends?

No. I guess not.

383

[David] I'm not sure Nick's too interested
in looking for girlfriends, really.

Don't you dare.

David, be respectful,
please, at the table. We have guests.

390
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,680
Charlie's my boyfriend.

I'm bi, he's gay,

about how I was gonna tell you,

394
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,920
but you know what?

395
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,960
I don't care
what you think about it anymore.

396
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,040
'Cause you don't care to even see us
more than two times a year.

I always think, "This is it."

"This is the time when you might actually
take an interest in my life," but…

So if you don't care, then…
[chuckles softly]

401
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,560
…then I don't care either.

402
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,200
And I don't know why
you're acting like you are ten years old,

403
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,120
but your bullying just doesn't affect me
anymore because, quite simply,

404
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,680
I do not care.

409
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,680
Just gonna let him speak to us like that?

410
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,600
Oh, David, be quiet.
We've heard quite enough.

411

It's Nick that's making a scene.

He's always causing a fuss.

Dad agrees.

You have not grown up into the man
I had hoped you would be, David.

to happen that way, but, um…

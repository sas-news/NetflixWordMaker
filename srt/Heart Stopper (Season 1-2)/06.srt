10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,680
Remember that summer,
when you were like 11

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,120
and we had to watch this every evening?

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,640
-It wasn't every evening.
-It was.

-No. [sighs]
-[Darcy] What are you doing then?

-[Elle] Nothing.
-Probably texting Tao.

34

I can text my friends if I want to.

-I literally knew it.

Shut up! It's not like
I can say anything to him.

41
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,480
He's my best friend,
and definitely doesn't like me back.

42

-You don't know that.
-I definitely do.

43

-You don't even want to try telling him!
-No. Can we talk about something else?

One day. One day, I'll get you.

55

Mind the door. That's the one
that locks you in if you let it shut.

You realize this is the room?

The room?

58
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,480
Our special room.
We got locked in and had our first kiss.

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,120
Tara, Darcy. I know it's nice
to sit and gossip with your friends,

61
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,800
but you're both late
for rehearsal. Come on.

62
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:25,720
There's still one person
that doesn't know we're a couple.

please, girls. Sitting up.

we'll be at Truham all day next Thursday
to practice for the spring concert.

72
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,800
Wait, we have another concert with them?

73
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,120
Darcy, I announced this weeks ago.

74
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,360
I think Truham and Higgs
should just combine into one giant school.

75
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,960
Yeah, same-sex schools
are a pointless idea generally.

76
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,320
I'm saying that as an absolute lesbian.

-[girl] Lesbians are so disgusting.

What is their problem?

80
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,840
I swear people
weren't like this before we came out.

81
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Want me to throw cheese at them?
I've got leftover cheese from lunch.

82
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,040
Nah. It's not like
they're saying it to my face.

83
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,080
Why do you have leftover cheese?

84
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,040
It always pays to be prepared
with anti-homophobia cheese.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,120
I had a question.

86
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,320
Yeah?

87
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,640
I just wondered, like…

88
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,160
How did you realize you were gay?

89
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,040
Oh. Uh…

90
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,760
I guess I've always been
sort of aware of it.

91
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,880
Even when I was really young.

92
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,360
I didn't understand it at the time, but…

93
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,760
It's always been boys.

94
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,080
I'm guessing you didn't feel
the same when you were little.

95
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,120
Well, no.

96
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,440
I don't know

97
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,520
what I am.

98
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,160
You don't have to figure it out right now.

99
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,520
I didn't just wake up one day like,
"Oh, look, guess I'm gay now."

100
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,000
Well…

101
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,120
I'm sorry for being all confused.

102
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,560

-Oi!

Wow.

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,960
-Just a suggestion.
-Wow.

-If you're not interested then--
-Okay. Hang on.

00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,320
It was two times.

171
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
[all laugh]

172
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,880
Oh, my God, do you know
what we need to do? Double dates.

173
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,120
Us and Charlie, tomorrow night,
before the concert, milkshakes.

174
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,160
-I like milkshakes.
-[Tara] Good.

175
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,920
Don't feel like you have to come out
to anyone before you're ready.

176
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,240
Oh. Yeah.

177
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,480
Being out is hard.

178
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,720
A lot of people
will see you in a different way,

179
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,280
and it is a lot to deal with.

180
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,320
Can I ask you something?

181
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,280
Yeah.

182
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
Are you, like,

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,360
definitely gay?

184
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,360
Or do you think you're bi, or…

185
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,120
I mean, when we were 13,
I think I did like you.

186
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,320
I mean, I think I have liked girls before,
so I wondered if you felt the same.

187
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,480
I'm definitely gay.
Kissing you was actually one of the things

188
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,120
that made me realize
I don't like kissing guys.

189
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,040
Okay…

190
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,200
Um…

191
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,920
-Happy to help.
-[Tara chuckles]

192
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,440
Uh, see you tomorrow?

193
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,560
Yeah, that sounds really good.

194
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,920
Um…

195
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,280
You're kind of the first people
I've told about Charlie.

196
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,920
Really?

197
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,160
Yeah.

198
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,680
And does it feel good
to have told someone?

199
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,720
Yeah.

200
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,720
Really does.

201
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,560
You can't come in here.
Nick's coming round.

202
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,560
Oh.

203
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,400
I didn't realize you were
in a committed relationship.

204
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,360
What?

205
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,480
We're not…

206
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
He's not…

207
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,120
Shut up.

208
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,960
Wow. So not ready
to tie the knot yet then?

209
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,880
[laughs] Shut up.

210
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,000
Even if we were together…

211
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,160
[knocking at door]

212
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,560
[soft pop music playing]

213
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,920
What?

214
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
What?

215
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,040
You're staring.

216
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,920
-No I wasn't.
-Yeah, you were.

217
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,480
-Do your homework.
-[chuckles]

218
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,160
You know, I was talking
to Tara at the rehearsal today…

219
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,400
Yeah?

220
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,080
-You heard she came out, right?
-Yeah, she put it on Insta.

221
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,880
I told her we're together.

222
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,800
What?

223
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,680
I told her we're going out.

224
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,200
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

225
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,040
[laughing] You're amazing!

226
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,720
Wait. Are you sure you wanted to?

227
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,680
Um, yeah.

228
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,000
You didn't force yourself
because I'm out--

229
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,720
No, I wanted to tell them.

230
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,920
[Nick grunts]

231
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,960
[Nick] So, how about
the concert tomorrow night?

232
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,600
[Charlie] You really don't have to come.

233
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,920
-It'll be boring.
-No, I want to support you.

234
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,360
[Charlie laughs softly] Um…

235
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,440
Okay, but if you change
your mind, that's fine.

236
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,760
And Tara and Darcy want us to go

237
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,640
and get milkshakes
with them before it starts.

238
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
Like a double date.

239
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,920
I've never been on a date.

240
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
Me neither.

241
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Want to go on one?

242
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,560
Yeah.

243
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,040
Cool. Um…

244
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,160
I'll…

245
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,440
I'll see you tomorrow.

246
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,440
Okay.

247
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,720
Bye.

248
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,120
Bye.

249
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,760
[cell phone chimes]

250
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
[chuckles softly]

251
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,120
Ooh, ooh.

252
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,560
Oh. Oh!

253
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,480
[Tao] Oh, no. Oh, no.

254
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,760
Oh, whoa, whoa. Whoa!

255
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,000
[both chuckle]

256
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,560
Since when were you coming to this?

257
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,080
I thought it was bribery
to get me to come to his boring concert.

258
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,120
-You're here for the milkshakes then?
-I said what I said.

259
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,360
[Elle] Come on.

260
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,880
[whirring]

261
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,720
[Tao] Do you ever play film music?

262
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,560
-[Tara] Yeah, sometimes.
-Well, then it's not boring.

263
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,560
Why'd you agree to come
if you thought it would be boring?

264
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,920
Because I'm a very nice
and supportive friend.

265
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,720
No, he came for the milkshakes
and the milkshakes <i>only.</i>

266
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,240
-I said that to you in confidence.
-How did you two become friends?

267
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,000
I was friends with Charlie first
and Tao came along as a package deal.

268
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,200
-[exclaims]
-[laughter]

269
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,960
[rolling tongue] Rude!
You're lucky to have me.

270
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,640
You make a cute little pair.

271
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,240
So, we're ordering a second round, right?

272
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,360
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

273
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,280
-We can go and get them.
-[Tara] Can I have a strawberry one?

274
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,880
-Strawberry.
-Banana again.

275
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,600
Oh, my God, no, that is a crime!

276
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,400
I cannot believe you're disrespecting
bubblegum flavor in front of me.

277
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,200
Right. Let me try yours.

278
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,520
Wow.

279
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,520
See? I make good choices.

280
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,680
-We should swap.
-No, you made your choice.

281
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,760
Okay, well, we can share.

282
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,520
We are on a date.

283
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,080
Is that the official rule of dating?

284
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,160
Sharing drinks?

285
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,200
Yeah.

286
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,600
We should go on a date, just us.

287
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,200
I mean, if you want to.

288
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,400
It's all right if you don't want to.

289
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,400
Actually, no, sorry, that was stupid.

290
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,440
We should.

291
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,240
I'd like that.

292
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,480
[laughs softly]

293
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,920
After we'd kissed, like, six times…

294
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,200
-It was two, but sure.
-…Tara agreed to be my girlfriend.

295
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,200
That's a really cute story.
You two seem good together.

296
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,960
Yeah. I think
it's because we're friends too.

297
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,280
Seems obvious, but you should be good
friends with the person you're dating.

298
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,880
Yeah.

299
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,720
That makes sense.

300
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,760
Yeah.

301
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:32,200
Tao, can you come
help us carry the glasses?

302
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,200
Yeah.

303
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,120
[grunts]

304
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,760
-What are you doing?
-What do you mean?

305
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,040
You're clearly trying to set something up
between me and Tao.

306
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,320
We thought if we could hint to him
that you'd make a good couple…

307
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,320
-But I didn't ask you to do that.
-But you like him, so--

308
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,440
I don't want him to know that.
Just because you two came out,

309
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,960
doesn't mean I also want
to share all my secrets.

310
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,400
Friendship is more important.
If he knew, things would change,

311
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,080
and I've had to deal
with enough changes in my life lately.

312
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,040
I don't want anything else to change.

313
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,760
Yeah. Sharing stuff
like that changes everything.

314
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,680
Not always for the better.

315
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,480
Bubblegum's more interesting.
It's more interesting.

316
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,240
-Not interrupting anything, am I?
-Um, what?

317
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,560
No, we were just chatting.

318
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,880
Okay then.

319
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,840
[blender whirring]

320
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,840
You take those back,
I'll wait for the last two.

321
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,640
-Are you sure?
-[Tao] Yeah.

322
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,920
Okay.

323
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,640
-Thanks.
-[cashier] Cheers.

324
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,800
[Nick] Here we are.

325
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,520
Is this some sort of
"no boys allowed" conversation?

326
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,920
Did you know this too?

327
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,880
The me and Tao thing.

328
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
Um…

329
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,600
Yeah.

330
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,480
So this whole thing was just a setup?

331
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,440
We thought it would be fun
to go on a triple date.

332
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,520
A triple date?

333
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,080
Yeah. You and Tao, Tara and Darcy, and…

334
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,360
You and Charlie?

335
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,120
Yeah.

336
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,440
You two are together?

337
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,080
-Yeah.
-[gasps] Charlie! I'm so happy for you.

338
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,960
I mean, I'm happy for you too,

339
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,440
but you didn't have to witness
all the months of intense pining--

340
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,560
[Charlie] Elle!

341
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,240
Do Tao and Isaac know?

342
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,680
I think Isaac guessed, like,
almost immediately after we got together.

343
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,320
And what about Tao?

344
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,240
Not yet.

345
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,680
I'm going to tell him.
I need to find the right time.

346
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,360
But he's the only one who doesn't know.

347
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,360
[Tao] Um…

348
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,200
Just so you know,
the concert's starting in 15 minutes.

349
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
[all] Oh!

350
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,240
[indistinct conversation]

351
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,240
-I really love you.
-Aw, I love you too.

353
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,240
Tara, Darcy, hurry up, you're late.
Sit down, chop chop. Thank you.

354
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,920
[laughter]

355
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,800
Uh, can I have less chatting,
more tuning, please? Thank you.

356
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,800
[girl] Don't look at her,
you'll catch the lesbian disease.

357
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,840
[giggling]

358
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,480
[Miss Hyder] It went well last time,
but we'll do it better today, aren't we?

359
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,040
Come on, put your foot under.

360
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
[both chuckle]

361
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,600
Take it. And that one.

362
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,160
[Nick] Okay. [clears throat]

363
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,680
And then, um…

364
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,800
I'm glad you came.

365
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,880
-It seemed like you didn't want me to.
-No, I did. I just…

366
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,880
I thought you were trying not to be rude.

367
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,840
No.

368
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,080
I just…

369
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,520
I like being with you.

370
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,520
Also, we've been hanging out a lot and…

371
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,600
If people guessed we were together,

372
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,640
if they started
saying stuff about you then…

373
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,320
Well, I really don't want you
to have to deal with that.

374
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,240
I, um…

375
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,760
I've been researching about

376
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,000
being bisexual.

377
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,760
Uh…

378
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,520
I think that might be me.

379
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,920
But I… I'm not sure.

380
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,280
Has anyone seen Tara and Darcy?

381
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,880
I'm about to open
the doors for the audience.

382
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,960
I just want some peace and quiet.

383
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,880
The door!

384
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,320

[Darcy groans]

386
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,640
Oh, no.

387
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,680
No signal.

388
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,880
Can't believe this is the second time
we've been locked inside here.

389
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,840
-Sorry.
-It's fine.

390
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,720
Didn't want to do
the concert thing anyway.

391
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,720
Talk to me.

392
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,320
Everything's changed.

393
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,960
-Since we came out?
-Yeah.

394
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,320
Do you regret it?

395
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,720
No. [hesitating] I just wasn't prepared
for things to change.

396
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,080
I didn't… I didn't think
so many people would suddenly think

397
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,960
I'm a completely different person.

398
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,240
-They don't think that.
-They do.

399
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,720
It's different for me.
You came out years ago.

400
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,880
I'm not loud and confident
about being a lesbian.

401
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,280
I could barely say the word lesbian
when we started going out,

402
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:36,040
and now I've got people on my Instagram,
like, "Oh, my God, you're a lesbian."

403
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,960
People giving me funny looks
in the corridors.

404
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,480
I wasn't prepared for any of it.

405
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,840
I don't know how to behave anymore and…

406
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,360
I just want to live my life.

407
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,000
You're so confident about your sexuality,
and I still feel like I know nothing.

408
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,000
Hey, I don't know anything either.

409
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,240
I don't know anything about anything.

410
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,280
I just want to live my life.

411
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,240
We can do that.

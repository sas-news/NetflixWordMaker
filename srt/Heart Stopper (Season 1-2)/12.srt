We probably shouldn't drink alcohol.

It took ages for me to even feel
comfortable calling myself a lesbian,

243
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,120
and… and we were so scared
of what people might say at school,

244
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,800
so we didn't tell anyone
about us for months.

about all those people.

and… she didn't say it back.

262

Fine. We're totally back to normal.

348
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,920
It was fun.

349
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,840
-It was really fun.
-[Darcy] Mm-hmm?

350
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,840
[Tara] And?

351
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,800
And that's it.

352
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,880
We're just friends again.

353
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,080
-As if. As if. As if.
-That is it!

354
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,800
-There's more to it!
-[Darcy] No! No, no.

355
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,680
We could go to the Sacré Coeur?

356
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,400
Or we could do some shopping?

357
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,320
Or go to the museum?

358
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,160
-[boy] All right, whatever, man.
-[Imogen scoffs]

359
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,480
-Get off!
-[Ben] What?

360
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,640
Hey, guys!

361
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,760
Um… do you guys mind
if I hang with you for a bit?

362
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,600
-Ben's being so boring.
-[Nick] Of course not.

363
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,120
-Sure.
-Feel free.

364
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,880
-[Charlie] Been to the Sacré Coeur yet?
-No, I haven't.

365
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,920
[Charlie] Let's go together then. Come on.

366
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yay! Thanks, guys.
You guys are more fun. [chuckles]

367
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,840
It's like he doesn't even wanna hang out
with me anymore now that we're dating.

368
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,160
All he cares about is having a girlfriend.

369
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,520
And now he just ignores me all the time.

370
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,360
-I'm not even sure he likes me that much.
-Do you even like him?

371
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,400
He sounds horrible.

372
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,760
What about you?

373
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,760
Do you have anything going on with anyone?

374
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,840
-I thought maybe you and Tao--
-No! Not gonna happen.

375
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,000
We're fine just being friends.

376
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,600
Okay.

377
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,040
Maybe I haven't had
the best track record of relationships,

378
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,440
but I think being honest
is better than living with regret.

-[laughter]
-[Charlie] Tao, what are you doing?

380
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,720
[James] What are you on about?

381
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,720
-Tao!
-Why are you walking like that?

382
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,560
What's wrong with you? Oh my God!

383
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,000
There's not even any music!

384
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,680
Tao-wuh!

385
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,160

Everyone's here.

-No!

404
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,360
[Tao] Here you go.
We're in France. It had to be done.

405
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,200
[Elle] Mm. I feel sorry for you
and your terrible decisions.

406

407
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,520
No, don't. Don't do it. Don't do it.

-[Darcy] No!
-[Nick] Yes, Tao!

409
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,400
-[Charlie] Tao!
-Are you okay?

410
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,880
-[pupil] That is disgusting!
-[Darcy] Can you breathe?

-Thank you.
-You can have that one.

414

[waitress] Bon appétit.

415
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,520
I haven't spoken to you properly in ages.

416
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,000
How was your first day in Paris?

[Imogen] Not interested
in how <i>my </i>day was then?

418
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,920
Why are you in a mood with me?

419
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,640
Because you're supposed
to be <i>my </i>boyfriend!

420
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,760
But instead, you've got
some sort of obsession with Charlie.

421
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,040
-[cutlery clatters]
-What are you trying to say?

422
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,880
I don't know
why you're obsessed with Charlie!

423
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
And, to be honest, I don't even care.

424
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,080
All I know is you're a terrible boyfriend,
and I deserve better.

425
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,760
I'm breaking up with you.

[kids gasp]

427
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,160
Your energy's off!

428
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,360
You're not mature,
and clearly you have some issues

429
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,040
that you need to resolve
before you're ready for a relationship.

430
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,960
And I'm not gonna wait around for you!
I think it's time I focused on myself.

431
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,840
If you don't want to be with me anymore,
 that's fine,

432
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,440
but you don't have to be
such a bitch about it.

433
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,280
Benjamin, language.

434
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,760
-[boy] She's got a point.
-Pipe down.

435
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,480
There's no need to call her a bitch. What?

436
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,080
[scoffs]

437
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,040
Fine then.

Hey.

446
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,480
Just wanted to come and check
that you were okay.

447
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,000
I think I am.

448
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,440
I don't know, maybe I shouldn't have
done that in front of everyone.

449
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,040
Well, I think it was one
of the coolest things I've ever seen, so…

450
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,720
-[Imogen chuckles softly]
-Agreed.

451
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,400
Did you and Ben ever…

452
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,720
It doesn't matter.

453
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,680
He's gone now.

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,760

if I was into girls.

Uh…

I'm not so sure about that,
but, um… I know what you mean.

Could I maybe have a hug?

459
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,240
How'd it go with Elle today?

460
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,560
It was fine.

461
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,440
We just walked around the museum
for a bit.

462
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,120
It was nice.

463
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,640
I always thought
you two would be good together, so…

You don't get it.

the most amazing person in the world.

She's gone through so much shit.

Like, I was her friend
when she came out as trans,

468
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,520
and that was not a fun time for her.

469
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,040
Why would she ever like me anyway?

She's so cool and interesting
and beautiful, and I'm…

-But not beautiful?

if that's what you're worried about.

I might have.

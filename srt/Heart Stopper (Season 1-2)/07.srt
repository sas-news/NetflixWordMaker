Well, I believe that
you're not going out with him.

with someone as desperate as you.

You actually thought I liked you?

You were there like some tragic loser
with barely any friends,

walk over you. I never liked you.

Go on then.
What's your problem with Charlie?

155
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,560
He doesn't exactly fit in
with us, does he?

156
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,919
He can't play rugby, he's got this
weird friend who won't leave me alone.

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,120
You can't just bring some gay boy
into our group

158
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,400
and expect us all to immediately love him.

159
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,159
So this is a problem with him being gay?

160
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,480
Come on, none of us are being homophobic.

161
00:08:41,558 --> 00:08:43,000
Just shut up, Harry!

162
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,840
You made him so uncomfortable
with your gay questions.

163
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,159
Someone really needs to learn
to take a joke.

164
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,280
But you weren't joking though, were you?

165
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,760
You saw the perfect opportunity

166
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,720
to make someone feel
miserable and humiliated, as usual.

167
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,880
I'm sure he can deal with it.
He's probably used to it by now.

Aw. You're getting so angry.

170
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,360
You can't help wanting to
protect him, can you?

171
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,920
Because he's a pathetic little fag.

[boys exclaiming]

173
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,200
So are you going to tell me what happened?

174
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,200
There's not really anything to tell.

175
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,560

Harry was saying some
really nasty stuff about Charlie.

178
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,800
He's been really gross and mean
about him for ages, and I just…

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,840
I lost it.

180

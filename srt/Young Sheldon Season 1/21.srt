00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:04,171
I've been corresponding

00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:04,171
with Dr. John Sturgis

4
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:05,380
at East Texas Tech.

5
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:07,382
He said I could audit

his course.

7
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,384
Connie, I would like

8
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,384
to see you again.

9
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,345
Perhaps we could have

10
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,345
dinner sometime.

11
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,555
Yes, we would love that.

12
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:14,932
We would?

13
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:17,017
If they get married,

14
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:17,017
we immediately double

Hmm.

You weren't kidding.

Spaghetti and hot dogs

101
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,467

Even better

104
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,512

00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,512
the chunk ratio.

106
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,389
So, Dr. Sturgis,

107
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,389
Sheldon tells us

108
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,266
you're a guest professor

109
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,266
at the university.

110
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,810
I am.

111
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,810
Hmm.

112
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,770
Does that mean that

113
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,770
you're only here temporarily?

114
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,897
Well, that's the plan for now.

115
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:14,903
But I could be enticed to stay.

116
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,031
Meemaw, I do believe

117
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,031
there was subtext there.

118
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,281
Did you pick up on it?

119
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,533
Yeah.

120
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,868
Was I correct to infer

121
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:21,952
there was subtext there?

122
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:22,995
You were.

123
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,913
Okay, we're all good.

124
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,000
I can't believe

125
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,000
they're making me sit and eat

126
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,250

127
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,837
It's better here.

128
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,837
How?

129
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,714
We don't have to pray,

130
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,714
eat our vegetables,

131
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,090
and we can curse.

132
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,884
Hmm. Maybe you're right.

133
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,887
Course I am, you ass-face.

134
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,806
SHELDON: Dr. Sturgis,

135
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,806
do you think

136
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,474
we're ever going

137
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,474
to unify gravity

138
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,601
with the other three

139
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,601
fundamental forces?

140
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,897
I have a sticky note

141
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,897
on my refrigerator

142
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,566
which reminds me every day

143
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,566
to do just that.

144
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,360
(chuckles)

145
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,360
When did you decide

146
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,360
to focus your research

147
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,862
on quantum...

148
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,862
Um, Sheldon, I think

149
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,989
you're kind of dominating

150
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,989
the conversation.

151
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,742
Why don't you let your

152
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,742
meemaw talk to Dr. Sturgis.

153
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,369
Oh, I'm sorry. By all means.

154
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,412
Thank you.

155
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,248
Connie?

156
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,248
Yes, John.

157
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:12,377
Do you smell like chlorine

158
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:12,377
on purpose?

159
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,257
You sure I can't give you

160
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,257
a ride home?

161
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,884
I can throw your bike

162
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,884
in the back of my pickup truck.

163
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:22,096
Thank you, no.

164
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:22,096
I-I enjoy the night air.

165
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,097

166
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,305
hot dogs and spaghetti

167
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,933
is a highly caloric event

168
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:29,019
that demands an aerobic

169
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:29,019
effort on my part.

170
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:31,772
Well, it was a pleasure

171
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:31,772
spending the evening with you.

172
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,273
We should do it again sometime.

173
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,691
Great. When?

174
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,026
How about tomorrow?

175
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:37,819
(sputters) You know what,

176
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:37,819
we'll figure it out.

177
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,321
Come on, let me see you

178
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,321
to your Schwinn.

179
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,615
Bye.

180
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,491
Good night.

181
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,491
(chuckles)

182
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,078
Well, that was

183
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,078
the most stimulating dinner

184
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,662
I've ever had in this house.

185
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,872
Glad you enjoyed it.

186
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,125
That man is a true role model.

187
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,627
Well, it's nice you finally

188
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,627
got a man you can look up to.

189
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,587
Oh, believe me, I know.

190
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,556
You gonna keep it

191
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,556
all bottled up,

192
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,725
or you want to

193
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,725
talk about it?

194
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,725
What?

195
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,477
I'm fine.

196
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,561
There's nothing to talk about.

197
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,772
You sure?

198
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,772
Yeah.

199
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,440
Sweet dreams.

200
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,532
You know you want

201
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,532
to talk about it.

202
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,993
You saw it.

203
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,328
My own son can't even imagine me

204
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,328
being a role model?

205
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,913
How am I supposed to

206
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,913
be okay with that?

207
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,207
You're a role

208
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,207
model for Georgie.

209
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,500
I used to be.

210
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,543
Now he wants to grow up

211
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,543
and be Tony Danza.

212
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,088
Did you forget you

213
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,088
have a daughter

214
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,506
who would really benefit

215
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,925
from having a good

216
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,925
man to look up to?

217
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,718
Oh, dear Lord.

218
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,846
You<i> did</i> forget.

219
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,846
(scoffs)

220
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,472
I didn't forget. I just...

221
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,766
I don't know how

222
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,766
to spend time with her.

223
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,226
It ain't rocket

224
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,226
science, George.

225
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,393
She's a little girl.

226
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,812
Ask her what she wants to do,

227
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,396
and then do it with her.

228
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,607
Oh, yeah. I suppose.

229
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,861
Trust me. She'll be thrilled

230
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,861
to spend some time with you.

231
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,279
Okay.

232
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,781
Yeah, I'll give it a try.

233
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,577
Hey, when we do, you know,

234
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,577
whatever it is she likes to do,

235
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,829
you're gonna be there, right?

236
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,206
No.

237
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,917
Well, this just got harder.

238
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,711
(groans)

239
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,592
Meemaw?

240
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,469
Meemaw!

241
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,013
What?

242
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,764
I've been researching things

243
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,850
that you and I can do

244
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,850
with Dr. Sturgis.

245
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,227
There's a lecture tonight

246
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,769
at Rice University called

247
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,604
"What's happening

248
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,604
at the center of our galaxy."

249
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,315
Let me just stop you

250
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,315
right there.

251
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,359
Don't worry. I know

252
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,359
what's happening at the center,

253
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,361
but I would never spoil it

254
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,361
for you.

255
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,321
Look, I know you're invested

256
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,073
in me and John

257
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,073
having a relationship,

258
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,657
and I'm not saying we won't.

259
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,785
But it ain't gonna happen

260
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,785
with you always underfoot.

261
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,371
Have I been underfoot?

262
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,873
Honey, in order for grown-ups

263
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,415
to get to know each other,

264
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:59,044
they need to have

265
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:59,044
some alone time.

266
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,797
What if I'm around,

267
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,797
but I took a vow of silence?

268
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,591
Go home and have your breakfast.

269
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,302
And then she said for grown-ups

270
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,553
to get to know each other,

271
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,347
they have to have time alone.

272
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,473
Makes sense. What else?

273
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:16,228
Apparently my being underfoot

274
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:16,228
isn't conducive to romance.

275
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,021
This is very helpful.

276
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,273
Thank you.

277
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,691
I'm at your service.

278
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,448
Oh, Celeste, why do you always

279
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,574
fall for bad boys?

280
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,742
GEORGE SR.:

281
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,742
Hey.

282
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,202
Hi, Dad.

283
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,620
What you doing?

284
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,996
Am I in trouble?

285
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,041
No, no.

286
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,041
Just-just checking in on you.

287
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,376
Why?

288
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,462
'Cause you're my daughter

289
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,462
and I love you.

290
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,005
This is getting weird.

291
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,799
It is. I was just

292
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,799
thinking that, uh,

293
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,467
you and me, you know,

294
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,136
we don't spend much

295
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,136
time together.

296
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,346
You know, we should

297
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,346
find something to do,

298
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,889
just-just two of us.

299
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,057
Like what?

300
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,057
You tell me.

301
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,726
What-what sounds fun?

302
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,230
I'd like to be taken to dinner.

303
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:02,774
Great. Where?

304
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,320
To the fanciest restaurant

305
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,320
in all of Texas.

306
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,654
Which is...?

307
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:11,158
Red Lobster,

308
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:11,158
where the surf meets the turf.

309
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,701
You got it.

310
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,995
Thanks, Dad.

311
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,080
Mom, you got to

312
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,080
take me shopping!

313
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,458
I need a dress!

314
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,169
(phone rings)

315
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,795
Yeah?

316
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,964
Connie, this is John Sturgis.

317
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,424
Well, hello, John Sturgis.

318
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:28,842
How are you?

319
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,303
I chipped a tooth

320
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,303
on a peach pit this morning,

321
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,596
but otherwise, I'm okay.

322
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,097
Good. Good to hear it.

323
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,557
Next order of business.

324
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,019
I would like to have dinner

325
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,019
with you tonight,

326
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,437
just the two of us.

327
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,232
Oh, well, that sounds nice.

328
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,942
What'd you have in mind?

329
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:50,864
I'd like to come to your house

330
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:50,864
and cook you a Szechuan feast.

331
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,240
I'm sorry, a what?

332
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,533
Szechuan.

333
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,286
It's a style

334
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,286
of Chinese cooking I learned

335
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,497
when I was traveling

336
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,497
through China.

337
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,582
Well, wonderful.

338
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,582
I would love that.

339
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,710
Great. Do you have a wok?

340
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,628
I do not.

341
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,838
Not a problem.

342
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,423
I have a travel wok.

343
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,633
Okay.

344
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,636
Uh, so, uh,

345
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,636
what do you say about 6:00?

346
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,929
It's a date.

347
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,348
Terrific.

348
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,851
Oh, and, um, let's not

349
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,851
mention this to Sheldon

350
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,687
so as to keep him

351
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,687
from being underfoot.

352
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,148
Have you been talking to him?

353
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,526
I have. See you later.

354
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,988
(chuckles)

355
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,743
Do I really need to get

356
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,743
dressed up to go to Red Lobster?

357
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,619
You're getting dressed up

358
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,619
for your daughter.

359
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,415
And that's a new shirt,

360
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,415
so be sure to ask for a bib.

361
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,623
Oh!

362
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,129
I'm ready.

363
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,630
You're going to

364
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,630
dinner wearing that?

365
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,384
I think you mean

366
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,384
she looks beautiful.

367
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,886
You look beautiful.

368
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,846
Why thank you, George.

369
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,890
How 'bout we stick

370
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,890
with "Dad" tonight?

371
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,142
Okay, but you call me Melissa.

372
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,271
After you, Melissa.

373
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,647
Thanks, George.

485
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,483
That's because you...

486
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,652
were born premature.

487
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,361

00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:51,956

501
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,551

503
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:04,761

00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,429

505
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,429
to be stuck up,

506
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,598
but then she got

507
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,598
a scoliosis brace.

508
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,350
Maybe she shouldn't

509
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,350
be playing tetherball.

510
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,977
That's what Heather B said.

511
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,980
This is delicious,

512
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,983

518
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,823
you might find interesting.

519
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,284
Spicy food is typically

520
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,284
found in warmer climates

521
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,161
because it

522
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,161
induces sweating,

523
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,539
which in turn,

524
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,539
cools people off.

525
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,166
So what does the runny nose

526
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,166
do for me?

527
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,836
It allows me to, uh,

528
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,464
gallantly offer you

529
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,464
my handkerchief.

530
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,132
You are such a gentleman.

531
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,217
When I was younger,

532
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,594
I read a book

533
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,594

534
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,179
That's how I know

535
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,223
that if I ever have an

536
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,223
audience at the Vatican,

537
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,142
I should wear evening

538
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,142

539

550
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,378
Oh, sure, sure.

551
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,507
Although, I hear

552
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,507
it might rain.

553
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:28,845
No worries. I have

554
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:28,845
a pocket poncho.

555
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,013

556
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,933

559
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,523
Oh.

560
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,944
No, thank you.

561
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,410
Don't they make babies

562
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,410
that are born too soon

563
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,661
stay in the hospital?

564
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:57,707
Normally, yes, but you were born

565
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,668
with such a great head

566
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,668
full of hair

567
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,463
that they sent you home with us.

568
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,215
That's the first thing you've

569
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,215

SERVER: Would you like me

583
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,159
to open it for her?

584
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,661
GEORGE SR.:

585
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,661
Oh, I got it, thanks.

586
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,916
You all right?

587
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,916
This thing's

588
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,916
freaking me out.

589
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,585
Here, let me help you with that.

590
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,840
Here. Okay.

591
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,216
The trick is not

592
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,216
to make eye contact.

593
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,135
Tell him.

594
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,637
Here.

595
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,765
All right, now,

596
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,765
we just... snap her off

597
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,351
like that... pop.

598
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,979
Grab this guy here,

599
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,814
and we crack the claw.

600
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:06,608
And then you take out

601
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:06,608
a little meat...

602
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,736
dunk it in some butter,

603
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,696
and then you eat it.

604
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,241
Holy moly.

605
00:17:14,282 --> 00:17:15,409
It's good, huh?

606
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,536
Unbelievable.

607
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,371
I'll leave you to it.

608
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:22,000
No. Sit with me.

609
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,169
Okay.

610
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,967
When I grow up, I'm gonna

611
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,967
eat lobster every night.

612
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,887
Well, hon, you better stay in

613
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,887
school and get a good education.

614
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,848
I was thinking I'd

615
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,848
just marry a rich guy.

616
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,726
Sure, that's a way to go.

617
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,311
Or a guy who works

618
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,311
at Red Lobster.

619
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,355
That's another way to go.

620
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,912
You seem quiet.

621
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,912
Is everything okay?

622
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:01,956
Are you not interested in me?

623
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,625
Of course I am.

624
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,625
I'm very interested.

625
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,627
Then how come when I...

626
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:10,256
I invited you to spend

627
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:10,256
the night, I got rejected?

628
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,299
I did do that, didn't I?

629
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,427
Good Lord, yes.

630
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,095
I can explain.

631
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,471
Please do.

632
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,975
I didn't want you

633
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,975
to think that I would think

634
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,769
that you were

635
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,769
the sort of woman

636
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,562
who would engage in coitus

637
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,898
simply because I cooked you

638
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,898
a Szechuan dinner.

639
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,983
It was better

640
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,983
before you explained.

641
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,946
All right, let me try

642
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,946
a different tack.

643
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,157
Connie.

644
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,367
Oh, boy.

645
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,160
Would you honor me

646
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,160
with an evening

647
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,247
of intimate relations?

648
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,833
Well, that is

649
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,833
a different tack.

650
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,647
This is very promising.

651
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,273
What's happening?

652
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,234
Dr. Sturgis's bike

653
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,234
is still at Meemaw's.

654
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,360
So?

655
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,529
That means he probably is, too.

656
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,698
You need to get a life.

657
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,408
(gasps) There he is.

658
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,335
Mom, Mom, Mom.

659
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,878
What's wrong?

660
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,878
What's going on?

661
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,589
Dr. Sturgis and Meemaw

662
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,589
had their first sleepover.

663
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,716
It's a big step in

664
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,716
their relationship.

665
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,052
I'm going to go

666
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,052
congratulate them.

667
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,429
Hey, put on a jacket,

668
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,429
it's chilly out.

669
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:41,973
Will do!

670
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,766
Or try saying he can't go.

671
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,726
Oh, never mind,

672
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,726
you can't go!

673
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,520
SHELDON: The last thing

674
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,520
I heard was jacket!

675
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,814
(groans):

676
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,814
Oh.

Sheldon, time to go.

25
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,173
We really need

26
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,173
to get one of these.

27
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,258
What on earth do we need

28
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,258
a computer for?

29
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,219
Yeah, we got you

30
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,219
and your big head.

31
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,303
But we can get

32
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,513
so much accomplished.

33
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,973
I could use

34
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,973
a spreadsheet program

35
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:57,599
to keep track of your expenses.

36
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,560
I do that in the back

37
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,560
of my checkbook.

38
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,229
Yes, but does your checkbook

39
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,229
go "beep" when you open it?

40
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,689
I don't think so.

41
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,190
Plus, the computer

42
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,734
can organize your recipes.

43
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,694
But my recipes<i> are</i> organized.

44
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:09,987
On index cards.

45
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:11,446
Like a cave person.

46
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,574
Cave Mom.

47
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,574
I'm gonna call you that.

00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,325
(sighs)

49
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,325
It doesn't matter, Sheldon.

50
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,869
We can't afford a computer.

51
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:19,413
Sure we can. It's only $998,

52
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,832
and Dave says we can buy it

53
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,832
on easy monthly payments.

54
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:23,083
That's true.

55
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,125
Stay out of this, Dave.

56
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,335
Come on.

57
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:26,420
We got to get home.

58
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,546
But...

59
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:28,839
Sheldon, I said no.

60
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:29,840
I can make you a good deal

61
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:30,841
on the floor model,

62
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:32,342
Mrs. Cooper.

63
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,803
Seriously, Dave,

64
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,803
you're getting on my nerves.

65
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:35,846
It's not fair.

66
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,514
You bought Missy a Ring Pop.

67
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:38,891
For ten cents.

68
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,935
And I'm worth every penny.

69
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,935
Let's go.

70
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,227

71
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,229

his name is Elliott,

97
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,148

100
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,318
I don't think so.

104
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,197
a computer?

105
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,532
Ever since he could talk.

106
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,826
But now more than ever.

107
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,661
Well, he should get a job

108
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,661
after school.

109
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:41,703
Save up and buy one.

110
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,538
Get a job? He's nine.

111
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,957
I mowed lawns

112
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,957
when I was his age.

113
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,083
Made pretty good money.

114
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,918
You want Sheldon to mow lawns?

115
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,004
He's so pale,

116
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,004
five minutes in the sun,

117
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,338
he'd burst into flames.

118
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,214
I would pay to see that.

119
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,257
Shut up, Georgie.

120
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,258
I hope you told him

121
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,510
we can't afford it.

122
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,219
Of course.

123
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,888
I could buy it for him,

124
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,390
and then y'all could pay

125
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,390
me back when you can.

126
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,476
Okay, Connie, now you're

127
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,476
just insulting me.

128
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,269
Well, that was not my intention,

129
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,980
but I'm glad to hear it.

130
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,106
I can pay my own bills

131
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:10,732
and take care of my family.

132
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,110
There are expenses

133
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,110
we could cut back on

134
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:14,736
so we could afford a computer.

135
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,363
You mean like the money

136
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,363
you give to church?

137
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,657
No, I mean like

138
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,657
the money you give

139
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,408
to the Lone Star Beer company.

140
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,702
(chuckles) Good one, Mom.

141
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,911
Shut up.

142
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,911
Shut up, pumpkin.

143
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,911
Shut up.

144
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,121
We're not getting a computer.

145
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:26,165
We don't need your money.

146
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,167
Where are you going?

147
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:31,086
To get a... glass of milk.

148
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,671
He's lying. He's getting a beer.

149
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,048
Shut up, Georgie.

150
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,716
(refrigerator opens)

151
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,890
Mom?

152
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,475
Why are you still up?

153
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,436
Madame Curie is on the roof,

154
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,648
and she's not wearing her hat.

155
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,025
You're just dreaming, baby.

156
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:56,528
But she'll be cold

157
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:56,528
without her hat.

158
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,864
I'll give her mine.

159
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,864
Now you go to sleep.

160
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,199
Mm, thanks, Mom.

161
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,159
You're the best.

162
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,371
Oh, Lord.

163
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:18,466
(sighs)

164
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,471
I'm guessing we're not having

165
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,471
our once-a-week.

166
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:27,308
Sorry, I only have relations

167
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:27,308
with gentlemen I like.

168
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,270
Oh, come on. You know how I feel

169
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,231
about your mother meddlin'

170
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,231
in our finances.

171
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,816
She wasn't meddlin',

172
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,816
she was offering to help.

173
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,902
And that computer

174
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,902
is not some silly toy.

175
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,946
Sheldon could use it

176
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,946
for his schoolwork,

177
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,907
and I could use it to...

178
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,907
organize my recipes.

179
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,034
You already got 'em organized

180
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,034
on those little cards.

181
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,410
Yeah, like a cave person.

182
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,121
Well, it doesn't matter.

183
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,539
We can't afford it,

184
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,539
end of story.

185
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,750
Not exactly end of story.

186
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,543
What's that mean?

187
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,503
I've been setting money aside

188
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,503
the last couple of years,

189
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,256
and this might be a good use

190
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,256
for it.

191
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,591
Money from what?

192
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,301
You know, here and there.

193

birthday money

196
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:07,266
from my Aunt Zelda.

197
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,268
And just how much

198
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,268
of this "here and there" money

199
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,518
you got saved up?

200
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,229
Well, seeing as it's my money,

201
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:14,022
I don't think

202
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:14,022
that's any of your business.

203
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,649
(chuckles):

204
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,649
None of my business?

205
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,858
You see every nickel

206
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,735
I make,

207
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,735
and you got secret money?

208
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,612
It's not secret.

209
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,612
I just told you.

210
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,489
Where you hiding it?

211
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,242
(sighs) Well, now you're headed

212
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,242
into secret territory.

213
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,161
Oh, okay.

214
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,663
Just so I'm clear,

215
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,663
my money's our money,

216
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,956
but your money's your money.

217
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,082
That's right.

218
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:35,002
Oh, good to know.

219
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,212
I'm glad we're not having

221
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,923
'cause I am not in the mood.

222
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,217
Really?

223
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,927
That's too bad.

224
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,846
Why? Are you?

225
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,222
No!

226
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,392

00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,695
a girl called for you.

230
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,821
What girl?

231
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,614
I don't know. A girl.

232
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,158
Well, what'd she say?

233
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,243
It's hard to remember.

234
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,243
This was months ago.

235
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,454
Hey.

236
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,873
Two cases?

237
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,333
You've got to be kidding me.

Don't worry,

239
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,084
I didn't use your money.

240
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,045

00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,468
We are going to Meemaw's.

245
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,221
Why?

246
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,848
Because your mom and dad

247
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,848
need a break from each other.

248
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,225
For how long?

249
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,227
I don't know. Just pack.

250
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,978
Will I need earmuffs?

251
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,521
Sure, if you want.

252
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,440
Although my almanac

253
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,440
does predict mild temperatures.

254
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,650
Then don't bring it.

255
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,777
I'll just bring my almanac.

256

You know what, I'll bring both.

00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,576
or use the one

260
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,576
I keep at Meemaw's?

261
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,869
I got this one.

262
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,705
Nobody cares.

I don't want

00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,998
to go to Meemaw's house.

265
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,457
What if that girl calls back?

266
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,168
Fine, then stay here

267
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,168
with your father.

268
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,628

Not a lot of time

271
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,633

What's he got in there?

277
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,946
Everything.

00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,291
Yeah.

285
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,876

Hello, Georgie speaking.

289

Did you run to the phone?

290
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,634
Do you feel stupid?

291
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,512
Who was it?

292
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,348
Nobody.

Don't make a big deal of it.

297
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,271
I'm not. I'm just saying

298
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,106
I'm better suited

299
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,106
to the single life.

300
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,857
And how do you picture that?

301
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,734
Okay, well, you know the buffet

302
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,734

303
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,153
where there's all kinds

304
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,153

305
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,862
and you can have

306
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,862
as much as you want?

307
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,364
Yeah.

308
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,367
It'll be like that,

309
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,367
only with hot girls.

310
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,244
Georgie, I'll bet you

311
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,244
a thousand dollars

312
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,204
you're married before you're 25.

313
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,373
You got a bet.

Well, I got to tell you

320

how happy I am

321
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,849
that y'all are spending

322
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,849
the night with me.

323
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,808
Your house smells

324
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,808
like cigarettes.

325
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,102
So happy.

326
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,270
Sheldon, we've

327
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,270
talked about this.

328
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,063
You don't need to announce

329
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,063
to people how things smell.

330
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,316
Hmm.

331
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,692
All right, you two, settle in.

332
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,069
Are you and Dad

333
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,069
gonna get a divorce?

334
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,570
Of course not.

335
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,365
Are you sure?

336
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,365
Packing up your kids

337
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,325
in the middle of the night

338
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,325
and moving in with your mom

339
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,494
has all the earmarks

340
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,494
of a divorce.

341
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,412
We're not getting a divorce.

342
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,039
Okay, go to sleep.

343
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,707
Sweet dreams.

344
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,926
I can't believe Mom and Dad

345
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,926
had a fight over beer.

346
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,346
I don't think

347
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,346
the fight was about beer.

348
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,056
I think there was

349
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,056
more subtext.

350
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,183
You're probably right.

351
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:22,187
Then again,

352
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:22,187
I don't know what subtext is.

353
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,483
I don't want to get

354
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,483
in your business,

355
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:27,984
but since you're

356
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:27,984
getting in my bed,

357
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,570
I'm getting in your business.

358
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,570
Go ahead.

359
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,531
When you leaving?

360
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,241
Very funny.

361
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,909
That wasn't a joke.

362
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,827
I love you, and

363
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,827
I love the kids,

364
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,954
but I love you better

365
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,954
living across the street.

366
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,957
Sorry the end of my marriage

367
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,957
is inconveniencing you.

368
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,418
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

369
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,626
It's a little spat.

370
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,837
No, this was

371
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,837
a long time coming.

372
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,673
This goes to the very core

373
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,673
of our relationship.

374
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,800
I see we're sticking

375
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,800
with dramatic.

376
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,429
The minute he found out

377
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,429
I had money set aside,

378
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,305
he felt threatened.

379
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,305
And you know why?

380
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,766
'Cause it meant that I can

381
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,766
live independent of him.

382
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,642
Sleeping in your

383
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,642
mommy's bed?

384
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,395
You know what I mean.

385
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,441
You gonna buy Sheldon

386
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,441
that computer?

387
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,609
Well, now I have to.

388
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,112
Got it.

389
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:23,540
You do know I still have

390
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:23,540
an active love life.

391
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,250
Just go to sleep.

392
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,132
On this very bed.

393
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,426
Oh, Mom.

394
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,349
What's for breakfast?

395
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,059
I don't know. Grab

396
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,059
a bowl of cereal.

397
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,061
Mom usually makes us

398
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,061
eggs and toast

399
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,354
and the occasional meat.

400
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,939
Well, Mom isn't here, is she?

401
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,776
Whoa. Somebody woke up

402
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,776
on the wrong side of the bed.

403
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,028
And you had a choice

404
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,028
'cause you had the whole bed.

405
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,155
Georgie.

406
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,198
Walking on thin ice.

407
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,535
Maybe you should go across

408
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,535
the street and apologize.

409
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,162
I can't do that.

410
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,538
Why not?

411
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,748
'Cause if I do,

412
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,748
it sets a bad precedent.

413
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,626
What's Nixon got to do with it?

414
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,002
What?

415
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,671
You said "bad president,"

416
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,671
like Nixon.

417
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,798
You know, this guy.

418
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,095
You going to apologize?

419
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:21,889
Dad!

420
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,433
Dad!

421
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,560
If you are, bring back meat!

422
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,068
GEORGE JR.:

423
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,068
Hey.

424
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,070
I hope you're happy.

425
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,823
Thank you, Georgie.

426
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,823
That's very kind.

427
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,492
Mom and Dad are fighting

428
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,492
because you want

429
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,951
to get a stupid computer.

430
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,995
What are you talking about?

431
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,288
Mom wanted

432
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,288
to buy it for you,

433
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,414
Dad said they couldn't

434
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,414
afford it,

435
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,832
Meemaw offered

436
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,832
to pay for it,

437
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,543
and now I'm eating

438
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,543
pineapple spears for lunch.

439
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,628
I hate making

440
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,628
my own lunch.

441
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,672
I'm sorry, Georgie,

442
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,672
I didn't know.

443
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,215
Yeah, well, now you do.

444
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,675
What did you get?

445
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,801
A turkey sandwich Mom cut

446
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,801
in the shape of a heart,

447
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,637
a fruit cup, a brownie,

448
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,764
and a note from Meemaw saying

449
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,764
how much she loves me.

450
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,393
I haven't read it yet,

451
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,393
but I bet it's a lot.

452
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,811
I don't even have

453
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,811
a can opener.

454
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,108
Oh, Sugar Apple,

455
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,108
I love you so much.

456
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,278
Your affection for

457
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,278
inanimate objects frightens me.

458
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,280
I'm glad you're happy, Missy.

459
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,242
I'm even happier that I got

460
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,242
a toy, and Sheldon got nothin'.

461
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,077
MARY:

462
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,077
Well, now, we're

463
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,077
not exactly

464
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,453
done shopping.

465
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,581
Sheldon, you still want

466
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,581
that computer?

467
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,583
I thought we couldn't

468
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,583
afford it.

469
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,334
Don't you worry about that.

470
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,002
Do you want it or not?

471
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,921
More than anything.

472
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,215
All right, then,

473
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,215
let's go get it.

474
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:41,010
Wait. He gets a computer

475
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:41,010
and I get a lousy toy?

476
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,679
I thought you liked it.

477
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,972
Not anymore.

478
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,100
(sighs)

479
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,853
Where's the water come out of?

480
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,814
Well, seeing as that's

481
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,814
the dryer, nowhere.

482
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,108
Hmm.

483
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:57,818
So this one's the washer?

484
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,028
No foolin' you.

485
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,614
What are you doing?

486
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,823
Separating the whites

487
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,823
from the colors.

488
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,451
Whoa, that's racist.

489
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,370
How did I get a rocket scientist

490
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,370
for one son

491
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,706
and a rodeo clown

492
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,706
for the other?

493
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,706
Oh, man.

494
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,375
I'd give anything

495
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,375
to be a rodeo clown.

496
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,043
They make

497
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,043
people happy,

498
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,212
and they see the rodeo for free.

499
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,591
(sniffs) Mmm.

Hello, I am Eliza.

00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,241
My... parents...

514
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,953

515
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,539
a lot.

I see.

517
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,417
Can you elaborate on that?

518
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,711
My mother...

519
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:00,881

Hello, I am Eliza.

538
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,472
The future might be overrated.

539
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,100
Okay, water's

540
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,100
definitely on.

541
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,227
Try it now.

542
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,854

just turn it on.

Wait, I know what to do.

554
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:08,825
What?

555
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,744
Go across the street

556
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,744
and apologize to Mom.

557
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,246
I got nothin' to apologize for.

558
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,415
You don't have to mean it.

559
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,415
I never do.

560
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,708
Georgie, just mind

561
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,708
your business.

562
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,917
Okay, sorry.

563
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,419
In case you

564
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,419
were wondering,

565
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,254
I didn't mean that.

566
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,297
See how easy it is?

567
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,924
(dial spinning)

568
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,635
These home computers

569
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,635
are amazing.

570
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,387
I could start a real

571
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,387

572
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,722
with that thing.

573
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,640
And that would go a

574
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,640
long way to giving you

575
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,601
the financial independence

576
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,601

578
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,773
Just for your information,

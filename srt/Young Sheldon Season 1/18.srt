1
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,213
Hey, what you reading?

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,924
A magazine.

3
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:08,926
Oh. Making a collage for school?

4
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:10,678
No, just reading it.

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,680
Look at that.

6
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,557
Maybe Sheldon isn't

7
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,557
the only bookworm around here.

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,517
Which magazine?

9
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,602
<i>Cosmopolitan.</i>

10
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,602
What?

11
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:21,438
It's a magazine

12
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:21,438
for today's woman.

13
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,566
Hey! I was about to find out

14
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,566
what turns a man on.

15
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,025
Where'd you get this?

16
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,111
Heather. I traded

17
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,111
a Fruit Roll-Up for it.

18
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,531
Well, this is going

19
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,531
in the garbage.

20
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,531
You sure?

21
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,492
It's got some great tips on

22
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,492
how to spice up your marriage.

23
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,370
My marriage is fine, thank you.

24
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,456
And you are not to bring filth

25
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,456
like this into our house again.

26
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,458
That's not fair.

27
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,458
Sheldon reads dirty stuff

28
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,377
all the time,

29
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,377
and you don't say anything.

30
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,753
He does not.

31
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,672
Check out the comic book

32
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,672
on his desk.

33
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,010
(sighs)

34
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,427
MARY:

35
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,427
What?

36
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,637
Oh, my goodness.

37
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,430
Oh.

38
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,265
Oh, my.

39
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,019
Hold on. No. No.

40
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,146
Th-This blue man's backside

41
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,146
is all over the place.

42
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,316
On page 112, you get to see

43
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,316
his front side.

44
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:08,694
(gasps) Oh!

45
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,404
(sighs)

46
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,156
I'll be back.

47
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,156
Where you going?

48
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,409
To give the owner

49
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,409
of that comic book store

50
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,036
a piece of my mind!

51
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,036
Cool.

52
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,371
And then I'm calling

53
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,371
Heather's mom!

54
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,123

Vietnamese superheroes?

69
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,156
There's one called

70
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,156
Half-Face.

71
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,909
Why?

72
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:59,036
The communist government

73
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:59,036
forced him to build bombs,

74
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:00,871
and one blew off

75
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:00,871
half his face.

76
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:03,415
The left half or the right half?

77
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,792
The bottom half.

78
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,668
That's an important half.

79
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,753
(door bells jingle)

80
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,966
Excuse me.

81
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,966
Did you sell this to my son?

82
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,341
I don't know.

83
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,341
Who's your son?

84
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,218
The little boy in the corner.

85
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,723
Which one?

86
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,723
Sheldon Cooper.

87
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,101
Oh. Yeah.

88
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,894
Look at him!

89
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,438
He is the same size as

90
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,438
one of the dolls you sell here.

91
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,689
Those are action figures.

92
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,566
Where is your sense

93
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,566
of responsibility?

94
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,068
Have you looked

95
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,068
inside this book?

96
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,402
Because I have.

97
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,113
ADULT SHELDON:

98
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,113
<i>At that moment,</i>

99
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,782
<i>I felt a subtle heat</i>

100
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,782
<i>rising through my body.</i>

101
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,493
<i>I was used to being humiliated</i>

102
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,493
<i>by my siblings</i>

103
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,578
<i>on a daily basis,</i>

104
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,578
<i>but from my mother?</i>

105
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,705
<i>This was new territory.</i>

106
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:46,000
Mom, you're embarrassing me.

107
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,876
Oh, is that right?

108
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,252
Well, guess what.

109
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,252
I don't care.

110
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,212
And if I catch you

111
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,212
doing it again,

112
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,590
I'll be back with my husband;

113
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,590
he is way scarier than me.

114
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,801
I doubt that.

115
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,801
Let's go.

116
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,636
But I came here with Tam.

117
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,596
Tam, you coming or not?

118
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,098
I'm good.

(door closes)

125
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:15,403
As you can see,

126
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:15,403
I'm not related to them.

127
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,035
WEATHERMAN (over radio):

128
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,035
And in local weather,

129
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,244
the tornado watch issued Tuesday

130
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,244
is still in effect for the area.

131
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,331
Stay right here for updates

132
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,331
as we get 'em.

133
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,001
I don't understand why

134
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,001
you'd even be interested

135
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,293
in a book like that.

136
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,171
One of the characters

137
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,171
is a scientist

138
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,839
who worked on

139
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,839
the Manhattan Project.

140
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,299
Well, it's filled with

141
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,299
violence and nudity,

142
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,968
and you are done looking at it.

143
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,636
But comics are a form of art.

144
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,429
You wouldn't forbid me

145
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,429
from looking

146
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,765
at Michelangelo's David

147
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,765
just because he's nude.

148
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,893
When a statue

149
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,893
of your naked blue fella

150
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,644
is on display at the Vatican,

151
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,644
we'll talk.

152
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:51,190
Actually, David is at the

153
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:51,190
Accademia Gallery in Florence.

154
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,568
Doesn't matter. I don't want you

155
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,568
looking at his bottom either.

156
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,405
Where's Mom?

157
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,699
Chewing out the guy

158
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,699
who runs the comic book store.

159
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:01,867
Why?

160
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,827
She found

161
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,827
an inappropriate comic

162
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,121
that Sheldon had

163
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,121
and went ballistic.

164
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,581
She also took my<i> Cosmo.</i>

165
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,666
What's a<i> Cosmo?</i>

166
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,960
A magazine for

167
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,960
today's woman.

168
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,837
Sucks for you.

169
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,714
You know, if I had something in

170
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,714
my room she might disapprove of,

171
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,593
I might be looking

172
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,593
for a real good hiding place

173
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,802
right about now.

174
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,846
I think I'm okay.

175
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,639
Your air vent?

176
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,853
(chuckles)

177
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,146
Boys are dumb.

178
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,523
D-U-M-B.

179
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,151
Dumb-a?

180
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,746
What are you doing?

181
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,082
Confiscating your comic books.

182
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,084
You can have them back

183
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,084
when you're 18.

184
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,961
You're taking

185
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,961
Casper the Friendly Ghost?

186
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,504
Ghosts are sacrilegious.

187
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,504
Nothing friendly about that.

188
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,465
Very well.

189
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,508
There's one more book

190
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,508
that belongs in the box,

191
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,555
filled with adultery, genocide,

192
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,555
and even human sacrifice.

193
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,475
You think you're so smart.

194
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:12,395
I do. And yet you continue

195
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:12,395
to treat me like a child.

196
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,731
You know what?

197
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,567
You want me to treat you

198
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,567
like an adult, you got it.

199
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,987
From this moment on,

200
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,987
I am done mommy-ing you.

201
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:24,032
Wonderful. Does that mean

202
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:24,032
I can have my comic books back?

203
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,244
Comic books are for children.

204
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,244
You're an adult.

205
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,212
ADULT SHELDON:

206
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,212
<i>My new adult responsibilities</i>

207
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,212
<i>began that night.</i>

208
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,547
<i>Luckily, a cookbook</i>

209
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,547
<i>is nothing more</i>

210
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,091
<i>than a set of instructions.</i>

211
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,093
<i>And if there's one thing</i>

212
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,093
<i>I shine at,</i>

213
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:44,886
<i>it's following instructions.</i>

214
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,474
Aw.

215
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:54,104
What's Sheldon doing?

216
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:54,104
(blender whirring in kitchen)

217
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,397
Cooking his own dinner.

218
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,397
Why?

219
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,608
He wants to take care

220
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,608
of himself like an adult.

221
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,360
I plan on putting that off

222
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,360
for as long as possible.

223
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,697
Really? It's a plan?

224
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,073
(clattering in kitchen)

225
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,867
Maybe I should go

226
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,867
keep an eye on him.

227
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,119
No. Let him handle this

228
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,119
on his own.

229
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,411
I wouldn't mind watching.

230
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,331
(sighs)

231
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,331
Let's just say grace.

232
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,875
(loud clattering)

233
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,875
I can't. I got to go in there.

234
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,084
If she's going, I'm going.

235
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,418
No one's going anywhere.

236
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,920
If he needs help,

237
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,920
he can ask.

238
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,379
SHELDON:

239
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,379
I don't need help!

240
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,590
Everything's under control!

241
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,926
(sighs)

242
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,887
You're really holding

243
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,887
the line on this one.

244
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,306
I'm sorry,

245
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,306
but he just pushed my buttons.

246
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:31,892
Don't be sorry.

247
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:31,892
I'm diggin' it.

248
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,518
Ew.

249
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,518
Gross.

250
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,519
I agree.

251
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,231
Pretty gross.

252
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,569
Y'all are mean.

253
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,864
How was your chicken?

254
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,910
Not bad. The dish soap

255
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,910
gave it a nice lemony flavor.

256
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,704
All right, bedtime.

257
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,706
Night, Mama.

258
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,706
Night, baby.

259
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,291
Have sweet dreams.

260
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,709
Love you.

261
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,709
Love you, too.

262
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,418
(kisses)

263
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,214
Sheldon, I assume you don't

264
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,214
need to be tucked in?

265
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,758
I can handle it,

266
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,758
thank you.

267
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,975
Okay.

268
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:17,020
Wow. No good night kiss?

269
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,064
That's up to your brother.

270
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,608
That won't be necessary.

271
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,736
Fine.

272
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,531
(door closes)

273
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,367
(TV playing quietly)

274
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,244
Had enough?

275
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,244
You gonna back down?

276
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,787
No.

277
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,663
He's real smart,

278
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,663
but he needs to learn

279
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,332
he doesn't know everything.

280
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:41,544
Woman, you are getting sexier

281
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:41,544
by the second. Whew.

282
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,797
Hey, now that you're

283
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,797
treating him like an adult,

284
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,715
can I have

285
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,715
his allowance?

286
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:49,510
That allowance is for chores,

287
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:49,510
which you already don't do.

288
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,346
Come on. We all know

289
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,346
I'm your favorite.

290
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:55,100
You're not even

291
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:55,100
his third favorite.

292
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,063
ADULT SHELDON:

293
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,063
<i>Making my school lunch</i>

294
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,063
<i>the next morning</i>

295
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,442
<i>proved no easier than dinner.</i>

296
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,442
(grunting, groaning)

297
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,902
Maybe you're turning it

298
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,902
the wrong way.

299
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,821
(straining): Don't you have

300
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,821
anything better to do?

301
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,572
Not better than this.

302
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,867
This is nothing

303
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,867
a little science can't fix.

304
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,120
All I need to do

305
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,120
is break the pressure seal.

306
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,250
(grunts)

307
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,461
I don't think

308
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,461
that was enough science.

309
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,962
MARY:

310
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,962
Morning, Missy.

311
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,214
Morning, Sheldon.

312
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,214
Morning.

313
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,757
Morning, Mary.

314
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,468
(clears throat)

315
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,594
Mom, you need to sign

316
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,594
this consent form.

317
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,886
What's it for?

318
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,014
Field trip.

319
00:08:34,054 --> 00:08:35,807
Where?

320
00:08:34,054 --> 00:08:35,807
Museum.

321
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,767
Which one?

322
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,767
Does it matter?

323
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,769
It's not like I'm gonna

324
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,769
learn anything, anyway.

325
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,690
It's the planetarium

326
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,690
at the science museum.

327
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,566
And I need you

328
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,566
to sign mine, too.

329
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,902
Oh. It's interesting

330
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,902
that an adult

331
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,364
would need his mother

332
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,364
to sign a consent form.

333
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,157
And here we go.

334
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,159
I don't need you to sign it,

335
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,159
the school does.

336
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,077
So you're saying

337
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,077
even the school doesn't think

338
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:59,080
that you're mature enough

339
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:59,080
to make all your own decisions.

340
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,334
ADULT SHELDON:

341
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,334
<i>In that moment,</i>

342
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:06,296
<i>I was so angry with her,</i>

343
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:06,296
<i>I almost opened the jar.</i>

344
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,090
(school bell rings)

345
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,678
I'm ready to go to college.

346
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,974
Okay. Where you thinking?

347
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:21,019
Somewhere with a good science

348
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:21,019
program, but far enough away

349
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,105
to make my mom cry herself to

350
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,105
sleep every night that I'm gone.

351
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,316
You're applying to

352
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,316
college out of spite?

353
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,777
I see why you're

354
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,777
the guidance counselor.

355
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,696
Okay, let's see.

356
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,865
What about Caltech in Pasadena?

357
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,201
I can't see myself

358
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,201
living in California.

359
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,286
I don't trust

360
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,286
their carefree lifestyle.

361
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,288
Okay. Um...

362
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,623
How about MIT in Boston?

363
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,625
Do they have

364
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,625
a strong physics program?

365
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,336
They're more of

366
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,336
an engineering school.

367
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,380
Next.

368
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,093
There's always Harvard.

369
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:59,266
Hmm. I don't like cold weather,

370
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:59,266
but I do look good in maroon.

371
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,186
All right, Harvard it is.

372
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,186
Thank you for your help.

373
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,772
Are you interested in

374
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,772
applying to a safety school

375
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,023
in case you don't get in?

376
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,110
Safety school. You're funny.

377
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,530
So, how was everyone's day?

378
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,240
I cut open a

379
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,240
frog at school.

380
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,075
For science class?

381
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,618
Sure.

382
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,870
We should put a lock

383
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,870
on the knife drawer.

384
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,289
(sighs)

385
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,251
What are you eating?

386
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,295
An English muffin with

387
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,295
ketchup and spray cheese.

388
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,296
No fair.

389
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,755
Lucky.

390
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,757
Sorry I spent an hour

391
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,757
making meatloaf.

392
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,259
MEEMAW:

393
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,259
So, Moonpie,

394
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,094
how's adult life treating you?

395
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,762
Very well, actually.

396
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,180
I'm working on my application

397
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,180
to Harvard.

398
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,057
Is that so?

399
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,393
Yes. And I'm planning

400
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,393
on transferring there

401
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,727
as soon as possible.

402
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,729
You're not going away

403
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,729
to Harvard.

404
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,731
I don't believe

405
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,731
you have a say in this.

406
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,068
Okay, well,

407
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,487
Harvard's real expensive.

408
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,238
How do you plan

409
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,238
on paying for it?

410
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,948
Oh, I'm sure

411
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,948
I'll get a scholarship.

412
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,409
Oh, are you?

413
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,409
Yes, I am.

414
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,661
(chuckles):

415
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,661
Okay. Okay.

416
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,122
Let's just take a deep breath

417
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,122
and talk about something else.

418
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,706
Fine.

419
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,503
I want to hear about that frog.

420
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,878
A different something else.

421
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,464
MARY: I just

422
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,464
realized something.

423
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,216
College applications cost money

424
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,216
just to send in.

425
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:18,052
They do?

426
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:18,052
$50, $60 a pop.

427
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,847
I don't believe you have

428
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,847
that kind of money, do you?

429
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,725
Will you excuse me?

430
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,728
I have to go take

431
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,728
a cold shower.

432
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,905
Hello, Randall.

433
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,905
I would like to apply for a job.

434
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,991
You would?

435
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,991
Yes.

436
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,410
I need to earn money

437
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,410
so I can apply to Harvard.

438
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,454
I thought about

439
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,454
going to Harvard,

440
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,207
but then I realized

441
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,207
The Shack is my passion.

442
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,876
So can I work here?

443
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,919
Excuse me. How much RAM

444
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,919
does this computer have?

445
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,214
Um, I can check

446
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,214
on that for you.

447
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:58,552
It comes with 640 kilobytes,

448
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:58,552
but it's expandable up to 768.

449
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,388
Well?

450
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,722
Do you even

451
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,722
have a résumé?

452
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:07,726
No, but I have a report card

453
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:07,726
that'll knock your socks off.

454
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,187
And what's the processor speed?

455
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,065
It has the Intel 8286,

456
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,065
so ten megahertz.

457
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:17,028
Sorry, Sheldon.

458
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,780
I think it's against company

459
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,780
policy to hire little kids.

460
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,534
But people say I'm like

461
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,534
an old man all the time.

462
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:26,037
Hey, I'm one of 'em,

463
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:26,037
but the answer's still no.

464
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,955
ADULT SHELDON:

465
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,955
<i>When people wonder</i>

466
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,500
<i>why Radio Shack eventually</i>

467
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,500
<i>went out of business,</i>

468
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,586
<i>you can point to this moment.</i>

469
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:33,670
(electronic door chime sounds)

470
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:35,922
Meemaw?

471
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,466
Meemaw?

472
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:43,012
Hey! Looking sharp.

473
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:46,057
You're not gonna try to sell

474
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:46,057
me a set of knives, are you?

475
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,976
No.

476
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,976
It's a joke.

477
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,605
'Cause of the suit.

478
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,523
Okay.

479
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,358
I need money

480
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,358
for my Harvard application,

481
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,279
and was wondering if there are

482
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,279
any jobs I could do.

483
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,780
Hmm. My yard could

484
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,780
use a little weeding.

485
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,117
I'm not terribly fond

486
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,117
of outdoor work.

487
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,495
Plus, that garden gnome

488
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,495
terrifies me.

489
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,123
Ernesto has that

490
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,123
effect on people.

491
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,708
How much does the job pay?

492
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,543
Well, let me think.

493
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,543
How about a dollar an hour?

494
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,212
How about five dollars an hour?

495
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,212
How about 50 cents an hour?

496
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,298
Wait a minute.

497
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,298
What just happened?

498
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,342
I'll tell you what.

499
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,342
I'll give you a dollar.

500
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,342
Thank you.

501
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,137
(laughs quietly)

502
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,180
(TV playing quietly)

503
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,932
Hey.

504
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,932
Hey.

505
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,602
You know how you think I

506
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,602
can't do anything for myself?

507
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,271
I do think that, yes.

508
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,398
Well, I have something

509
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,398
I'd like to show you.

510
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,193
You did some chores?

511
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,193
Come see for yourself.

512
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,447
I don't know if I'm ready

513
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,447
for another heart attack,

514
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,449
but here we go.

515
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,911
Feast your eyes.

516
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,252
You did all this?

517
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,878
I did.

518
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,048
You shoved everything in

519
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,048
the closet, didn't you?

520
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,217
Take a look.

521
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,396
I am impressed.

522
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,690
You should be.

523
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,775
There may be hope for you yet.

524
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,952
I thought that showed ingenuity.

525
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,581
Okay, here you go.

526
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,581
(wind rushing)

527
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:38,085
I got you a shovel

528
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:38,085
and a bucket and some gloves.

529
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,130
Did you check the gloves

530
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,130
for spiders?

531
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,800
Is this my first

532
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,800
day as Meemaw?

533
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,053
ELMER FUDD (over TV):

534
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,053
<i>It's not?</i>

535
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,681
No. It's duck-hunting season.

536
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:53,351
That, sir,

537
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:53,351
is an in-mitigated fabrication!

538
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,436
It's wabbit season!

539
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,436
Duck season.

540
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,813
(alarm blaring over TV)

541
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,940
Not again.

542
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,940
What's wrong, baby?

543
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,485
I'm trying to hear about

544
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,485
duck season and wabbit season,

545
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,987
but they keep talking about

546
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,987
this stupid tornado.

547
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:09,492
MAN (over TV):

548
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:09,492
The National Weather Service

549
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:09,492
has issued a tornado watch

550
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,537
for the following counties:

551
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,537
Angelina...

552
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,581
(wind whistling softly)

553
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,668
Hey, Shelly, how's

554
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,668
it going over there?

555
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,837
I hate everything about this.

556
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,088
(chuckles quietly)

557
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,715
You need to come home

558
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,715
with me.

559
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,174
No. I'm working.

560
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,802
There is a tornado watch.

561
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,802
Let's go!

562
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,012
Oh, come on, Mary.

563
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,012
We've had a watch

564
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,098
every day for two months;

565
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,098
nothing ever happens.

566
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,558
SHELDON: I think

567
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,558
you're just worried

568
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,059
I'm earning the money

569
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,770
to send in

570
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,770
my college application.

571
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,898
I am worried it is not safe

572
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,898
out here. Let's go!

573
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,816
I can worry about my own safety,

574
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,816
thank you.

575
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,943
I don't care

576
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,943
if you think you're an adult.

577
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,905
I'm your mother,

578
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,905
and you will do as I say.

579
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,905
(siren blaring in distance)

580
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,782
Well, that ain't good.

581
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,991
You believe me now?

582
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,493
Mom?

583
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,632
(thunder rumbling)

584
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,007
(glass shatters in distance)

585
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,927
I'm scared!

586
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,927
It's gonna be okay.

587
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,637
GEORGE SR.:

588
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,637
Georgie!

589
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,097
Help me get this

590
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,097
in front of the window.

591
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,097
On it.

592
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,602
Is this my bed?

593
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,602
Yeah.

594
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,813
Aw, it took me an

595
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,813
hour to make it.

596
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,105
(sighs)

597
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,817
You okay, Moonpie?

598
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,777
I'm all right.

599
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,987
I'm not. This is scary.

600
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,987
We're gonna be fine.

601
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,072
This'll blow through

602
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,072
in a few minutes.

603
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,826
(wind howling,

604
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,826
debris clattering outside)

605
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,537
I need to pee.

606
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,831
Can you hold it, baby?

607
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:41,125
We'll find out.

608
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,379
I'm not all right anymore!

609
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,090
Flashlights, guys!

610
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,259
What if it hits us

611
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,259
and we all die?

612
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,680
It's not gonna hit us!

613
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,680
<i>I</i> might hit you.

614
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,848
(thunder cracks)

615
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,099
But first,

616
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,099
I'm gonna hold you.

617
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,853
(house rumbling, glass shatters)

618
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,730
In the name of Jesus,

619
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,730
I place a hedge of protection

620
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,648
around this house and my family.

621
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:08,194
I command this storm

622
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:08,194
to skip over our home

623
00:17:08,234 --> 00:17:09,319
in Jesus' name.

624
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,530
I wish peace

625
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,615
to every single person

626
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,615
in this room

627
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,451
and declare that not one of us

628
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,451
will get hurt

629
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,162
in this storm, in Jesus' name!

630
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,830
(wind howling)

631
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,457
Pray harder!

632
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:22,625
Okay.

633
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,669
(thunder cracks)

634
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,462
(storm fades)

635
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,466
(birds chirping)

636
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:37,515
ADULT SHELDON:

637
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:37,515
<i>The good news was most</i>

638
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:37,515
<i>of our neighborhood was spared.</i>

639
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,017
MARY:

640
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,017
Oh.

641
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,476
<i>The bad news: my mother thought</i>

642
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,395
<i>she had something</i>

643
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,395
<i>to do with it.</i>

644
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,271
Looks like your house is okay.

645
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,107
You were just worried I might

646
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,107
have to come live with you.

647
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,694
Oh, I think the word you're

648
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,694
looking for is "terrified."

649
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,363
Hmm. Better go check on it.

650
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,865
I'll come with you.

651
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,950
Be careful.

652
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,537
Mom?

653
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,205
Yeah, baby?

654
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,049
(door opens)

655
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,136
You would not believe

656
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,136
the pee I just took.

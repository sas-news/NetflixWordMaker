1
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:08,216
You walk down a hallway

2
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:08,216
and come to a wooden chest.

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,218
Lord Gray Matter,

4
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,218
what do you do?

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,681
I poke it with my dagger

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,681
to see if there are any traps.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,933
There are no traps.

8
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:18,226
Fire Beak,

9
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:18,226
what do you do?

10
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,980
Billy?

11
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,980
What?

12
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,439
You are Fire Beak.

13
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,692
Okay.

14
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,194
So what do you do?

15
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:30,364
I'm Fire Beak.

16
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,281
MARY:

17
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,281
Hey, guys,

18
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,034
I brought snacks.

19
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,536
Thanks, Mom.

20
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,287
What are y'all playing,

21
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,287
Chutes and Ladders?

22
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,957
Tam is teaching us

23
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,957
Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

24
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,208
Oh.

25
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,459
We're on a quest to find

26
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,128
the pitchfork of a devil

27
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,128
named Baalzebul.

28
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,297
I'm Fire Beak.

29
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,883
And is this the devil?

30
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,385
No, he's just a monster

31
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,385
who doesn't wear pants.

32
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,178
Oh, I see.

33
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,806
Yes, oh, he's just hanging

34
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,806
right out there, isn't he?

35
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:58,726
Okay, well...

36
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,353
You kids have fun.

37
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,272
ADULT SHELDON:<i> My mother</i>

38
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,272

44
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,988

There are incantations in this

57
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,600
book to summon actual demons.

58
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,937
Is that how we

59
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,937
wound up with you?

60
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,813
That's a good one.

61
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,813
I'm gonna give you that.

62
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,147
This is not a joke.

63
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,816
This is one of

64
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,816
the children's games

65
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,109
we were warned about in church.

66
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,028
Then tell him

67
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,028
to stop playing.

68
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,362
It's not that easy.

69
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,031
He's finally got

70
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,031
a couple of friends.

71
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:55,323
I don't want to scare them off.

72
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,077
Well, when you're

73
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,077
ready to scare kids,

74
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,536
you got this face

75
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,536
locked and loaded.

76
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,081
All right, the other one

77
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,081
was funny,

78
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,083
now you're just being a jackass.

79
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,459
(George Sr. laughing)

80
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,086
I'm glad you're both amused,

81
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,669
but our little boy's soul

82
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,669
may be at stake.

83
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,380
Come on.

84
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,549
When I was a kid, we were

85
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,549
listening to Black Sabbath,

86
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,550
all that devil music.

87
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,094
Didn't hurt me.

88
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,845
Satan didn't get my soul.

89
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,932
What happened to it?

90
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,932
You trade it for some donuts?

91
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,644
You had that one coming.

92
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,644
(laughs)

93
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,483
(chickens clucking)

94
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,280
Hello? Mr. Sparks?

95
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,740
Oh, hello, Mary.

96
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,740
Got a minute?

97
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,533
Sure, what's up?

98
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:42,079
Um, I was just concerned about a

99
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:42,079
game that the boys were playing

100
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,789
and was wondering if

101
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,789
you and your wife

102
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:44,832
knew about it.

103
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,874
A game?

104
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,127
Yes, a very disturbing one.

105
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,503
Well, what're we talking about?

106
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,379
Did you catch those boys

107
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,379
playing grab ass?

108
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:55,258
No. Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

109
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,469
So everybody's got

110
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,469
their trousers up?

111
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,096
Yes.

112
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,096
What's the problem?

113
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,723
The game contains demonology,

114
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,892
which goes against

115
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,892
the teachings of the church.

116
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,769
But nobody's

117
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,769
touching nothing, right?

118
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,562
No.

119
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,106
Well, then I don't quite know

120
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,106
what you're worried about.

121
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:10,649
You don't?

122
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:10,649
Nope.

123
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,317
I'm just thankful Billy

124
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,317
found some friends

125
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,403
and he ain't eating dirt

126
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,403
and crabgrass any more.

127
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,073
Some point, he just

128
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,073
got a taste for it.

129
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,534
On an unrelated

130
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,534
note, uh,

131
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,994
you doing something new

132
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,994
with your hair?

133
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,996
It looks, uh, real pretty.

134
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,541
No, but thank you.

135
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,417
Okay, well, I'm gonna

136
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,417
leave you to it.

137
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,419
Smells good, too.

138
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,419
All right. Bye-bye.

139
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,130
Hey, you want chicken

140
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,130
for dinner?

141
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,840
I'll slaughter a big one

142
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,840
for you right now.

143
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,424
I'm good.

144
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,260
I'll kill one in case

145
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,260
you change your mind.

146
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,389
Now which one of you's

147
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,389
tired of this life?

148
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,143
You.

149
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,651
Excuse me, Mr. Nguyen?

150
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,195
Yes?

151
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,155
Hi, you don't know me.

152
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,155
I'm Sheldon's mother.

153
00:03:58,197 --> 00:03:59,531
Ah, the smart boy.

154
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,033
Yes, the smart boy.

155
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:02,617
You are lucky.

156
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,494
To have a smart son

157
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,494
is a great joy.

158
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,288
I do not have that joy.

159
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,458
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.

160
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,669
Listen, are you aware

161
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,669
that Tam and Sheldon

162
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,421
are playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons?

163
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,173
Dungeons &amp; Dragons?

164
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:20,177
Yes, and it's filled with

165
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:20,177
demons and satanic images.

166
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:23,263
(speaking Vietnamese)

167
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,897
So what is the problem

168
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,897
with this game?

169
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,607
The problem is,

170
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,110
it goes against the

171
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,110
teachings of the church.

172
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,737
All right. Listen to me.

173
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,573
A problem is starving to death

174
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,573
in a Communist reeducation camp.

175
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,283
A problem is not

176
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,283
seeing your family

177
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,244
for many years while

178
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,244
you remove land mines

179
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,162
from the Ho Chi Minh trail.

180
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,915
A game boys play with

181
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,915
make-believe demons,

182
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,750
not a problem.

183
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:56,004
Well... I think they

184
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:56,004
can all be problems.

185
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,801
I'm sorry, I agree with you.

186
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,010
I will talk to Tam.

187
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,721
Oh, good. Thank you.

188
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,432
Well, bye. Nice meeting you.

189
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,728
Five dollars.

190
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,399
(clock ticking)

191
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,779
(clears throat)

192
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,531
So, Pastor...

193
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,117
How's things going

194
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,117
at the church?

195
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,202
Please, call me Jeff.

196
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,956
And everything's going great

197
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,956
'cause I have the coolest boss.

198
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:34,209
I'm sorry, but I'm kind of

199
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:34,209
having a hard time

200
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:38,005
feeling the Holy Spirit

201
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:38,005
calling you Jeff.

202
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,965
I'm-I'm gonna stick with Pastor.

203
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,800
Sure.

204
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,178
Thank you, Pastor.

205
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,887
Yeah, that feels better.

206
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:49,516
So nice of you to

207
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:49,516
come over, Pastor Jeff.

208
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,476
He prefers Jeff.

209
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,061
I'm sticking with Pastor.

210
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,730
Wait, I changed my mind.

211
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,730
I'm going with PJ.

212
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,318
Brings to mind pajamas,

213
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,318
but that's fine, too.

214
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:03,446
Anyway, I'm sorry to

215
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:03,446
drag you into this,

216
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,615
but it is demons,

217
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,615
so it's in your purview.

218
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,284
It is indeed.

219
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,203
In fact, at a recent Young

220
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,203
Baptist Leaders Conference,

221
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,997
I attended a seminar on

222
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,997
satanic leisure activities.

223
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,623
And?

224
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,250
And the important lesson is,

225
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,919
rather than have a parent

226
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,919
or authority figure

227
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,796
take the offending game away,

228
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,216
let God remove it,

229
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,216
root and stem.

230
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:26,678
Question, PJ.

231
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:26,678
Uh, how's the big guy do that?

232
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,973
Simple, Sheldon needs to start

233
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,973
attending Sunday school.

234
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,142
If he likes books

235
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,142
with demons and devils,

236
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,312
I've got one that will

237
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,312
blow his mind.

238
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,064
What book is that?

239
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,357
The Bible, George.

240
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,649
Sure, yeah.

241
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,861
I think that's

242
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,861
a wonderful idea.

243
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,321
Although, I am concerned

244
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,531
that we may get a little

245
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,531
pushback from Sheldon.

246
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,742
A little?

247
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,369
No, I won't go.

248
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,996
I don't believe in God.

249
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,790
Well, now, what you

250
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,790
believe in is not the point.

251
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,625
Mary, if I may...

252
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,045
Sheldon, I understand you hope

253
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,045
to be a scientist someday.

254
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,462
Yes, sir.

255
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,756
Well, let me ask you a question.

256
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,423
You say you don't

257
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,423
believe in God,

258
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,425
but what kind of scientist

259
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,425
comes to a conclusion

260
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,719
without first doing

261
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,719
the research?

262
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,389
A bad scientist.

263
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,848
That's right.

264
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,059
So I'll see you

265
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,059
Sunday morning at 8:00.

266
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,685
No, you won't.

267
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:19,231
I cast a second level spell

268
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:19,231
of invisibility on myself.

269
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,362
Well, that game isn't

270
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,362
making him any smarter.

271
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,658
♪ ♪

272
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,960
Shelly, why aren't you asleep?

273
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,088
I'm studying for Sunday school.

274
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,923
You're reading the Bible?

275
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,175
That's wonderful.

276
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,509
I do have a question.

277
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,053
Sure, what?

278
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,056
Is there anyone in our town

279
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,056
from the Amalek tribe?

280
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,975
I don't know, why?

281
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:59,396
If there is, we're supposed

282
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:59,396
to kill them and their cows.

283
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,690
Well, no. There's

284
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,690
no Amaleks.

285
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,609
Told you.

286
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,324
PASTOR JEFF and CHILDREN:

287
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,324
<i>And lead us not</i>

288
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,284
into temptation,

289
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,120
but deliver us from evil.

290
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,289
For thine is the kingdom

291
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,333
and the power and the glory

292
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,918
forever and forever.

293
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,044
And ever.

294
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,044
Amen.

295
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,463
Amen!

296
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,463
Very good.

297
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,257
Now before we get

298
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,257
started this morning,

299
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,717
I want to introduce

300
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,717
two new students,

301
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,261
Sheldon and Missy Cooper.

302
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:32,720
Let's give them

303
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:32,720
a warm welcome.

304
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:35,640
(applause)

305
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,642
Yes, Billy?

306
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,852
I know them.

307
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,313
Thank you, Billy.

308
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,523
You're welcome, Pastor Jeff.

309
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:46,276
Now, uh, last week,

310
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:49,196
we started talking

311
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:49,196
about the Gospel of John.

312
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,864
Does anybody

313
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,864
have a notion

314
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,950
as to what God's getting

315
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,950
at in that passage?

316
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,494
Yes, Sheldon?

317
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,496
Chapter one, verse one states,

318
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,122
"In the beginning was the Word,

319
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,459
and the Word was with God

320
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,459
and the Word was God."

321
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,461
Well done.

322
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:07,214
Thank you. I read

323
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:07,214
the gospels last night.

324
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,132
Suck up.

325
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,009
Did you know when

326
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,009
the Bible says "the Word,"

327
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,261
they're translating the

328
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,261
Greek expression "logos,"

329
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,013
and logos means knowledge.

330
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,807
Sounds like someone has

331
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,807
a noggin full of "logos."

332
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,309
Yes, Billy?

333
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,602
They live on my block.

334
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,314
Terrific.

335
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,525
SPORTS ANNOUNCER:<i> ...as Ellis</i>

336
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,525
<i>will come in to punt.</i>

337
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,902
<i>Five kicks, 38-yard average</i>

338
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,530
I can't believe he's

339
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,530
reading the Bible.

340
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,240
I know.

341
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,616
I'm actually grateful to that

342
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,616
Dungeons &amp; Dragons game.

343
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,827
It helped lead him to God.

344
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,622
Ixnay on the Odskay.

345
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,419
I'm done.

346
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,045
You finished it?

347
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,465
All of it. Ask me which

348
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,465
birds are kosher.

349
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,967
I'll bite. Which birds

350
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,967
are kosher?

351
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,054
Chickens, yes. Quail, yes.

352
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,098
Owls, surprisingly no.

353
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,766
Well, there ain't a lot of meat

354
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,766
on them anyway.

355
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,518
MARY:

356
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,518
Shelly,

357
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,229
I'm so happy you're taking

358
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,229
an interest in religion.

359
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,813
I am.

360
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,775
And I've decided

361
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,775
to explore other religions, too.

362
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,777
What's this, now?

363
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,153
Pastor Jeff encouraged me

364
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,030
to approach religion

365
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,030
scientifically,

366
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,616
so it only makes sense

367
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,616
to enlarge my database.

368
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,243
MARY: No,

369
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,243
your database

370
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,370
is Baptist.

371
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,370
That's all the data you need.

372
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,746
Baptist data.

373
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,832
What other religions

374
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,832
you considering?

375
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,626
SHELDON:

376
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,626
Buddhist, Jewish,

377
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,503
Hindu, Catholic, all of them.

378
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,629
MARY:

379
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,629
Nope. Nope.

380
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,714
That's not happening.

381
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,427
Well, why? As an American, don't

382
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,427
I have freedom of religion?

383
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:38,054
Um...

384
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,931
Those dungeons and dragons

385
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,931
are looking pretty good

386
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,600
right now, aren't they?

387
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,102
I'm also looking into voodoo.

388
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,443
Tam, you're Catholic, right?

389
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:52,860
Yes.

390
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,404
Explain it to me.

391
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,490
Explain what?

392
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,325
Well, for starters,

393
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,325
who do you pray to?

394
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:02,036
I guess, Jesus, God and Mary.

395
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,038
Jesus isn't God?

396
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,499
No, he's his son.

397
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,542
But you do eat him,

398
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,542
and drink his blood.

399
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,086
Oh, there's

400
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,086
also a ghost,

401
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,172
but not the scary kind.

402
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,881
Like Casper?

403
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,009
Exactly.

404
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,511
And how does the pope work?

405
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,553
Well,

406
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,013
the pope lives in Italy.

407
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,057
He has a special car,

408
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,057
and a big pointy hat.

409
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,644
It's a wonderful hat.

410
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,646
And is there anything else

411
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,646
I should know about?

412
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,105
Every once in a while,

413
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,689
you have to confess your sins

414
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,689
to a priest.

415
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,234
Not me, I don't have any sins.

416
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,654
Then you have the sin of pride.

417
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:38,697
Your religion

418
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:38,697
is making me feel bad.

419
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,368
That's how you know

420
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,368
it's working.

421
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,827
(cart rolling)

422
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,663
Ms. Hutchins, what's

423
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,663
your religion?

424
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,414
I'm a Mormon, why?

425
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,667
I'm conducting

426
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,667
a research project.

427
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,627
Can you tell me

428
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,627
about being a Mormon?

429
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,962
Well, it started in New York,

430
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:56,090
when a man found gold plates

431
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:56,090
buried underground.

432
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,509
The plates

433
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,509
said that,

434
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,512
when we die,

435
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,512
we get to go to our own planet.

436
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,096
Unless you're a woman,

437
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,098
then you have to go

438
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,098
to your husband's planet.

439
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,724
But that won't be

440
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,435
a problem for me.

441
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,103
I don't have a husband.

442
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,189
All I have is a cat.

443
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,233
A big, mean cat.

444
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,568
Oh...

445
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,735
Maybe I'll get to go

446
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,735
to<i> his</i> planet.

447
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,782
Lonely Cheryl on Planet Cat.

448
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,495
I like her. She's funny.

449
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,123
MEEMAW:

450
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,123
You're gonna love Ira.

451
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,417
He's a great guy.

452
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,043
Is he your boyfriend?

453
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,546
Well, he's one of them,

454
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,546
so let's not bring that up.

455
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,089
(Meemaw chuckles)

456
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,091
(chuckling): Hey.

457
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,091
MEEMAW: Is this

458
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,091
a good time?

459
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,260
Absolutely.

460
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,260
Come in, come in.

461
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,596
Ira, this is my

462
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,596
grandson Sheldon.

463
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,556
Sheldon, this is my friend Ira.

464
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,516
Hello.

465
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,516
Howdy.

466
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:49,143
So Meemaw tells me

467
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:49,143
you're Jewish.

468
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,145
Right to it, huh?

469
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,980
All right, let's do this.

470
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,190
Please, sit down.

471
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,816
Thank you so much

472
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,816
for helping out.

473
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,653
Aw, Connie, you know,

474
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,653
anything for you.

475
00:12:58,695 --> 00:12:59,946
So, Sheldon,

476
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,030
you hungry?

477
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,407
You want a nosh?

478
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,451
I don't know,

479
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,451
I've never eaten a nosh.

480
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,703
(chuckling):

481
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,703
Uh, no, a nosh isn't a thing,

482
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,121
it's a... never mind.

483
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,749
Um, would you care

484
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,749
for some hard candy?

485
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,500
Are they kosher?

486
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:13,834
Who are you, my mother?

487
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,128
(laughs)

488
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,713
All right,

489
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,713
so what can I do for you?

490
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,340
What's it like to be Jewish?

491
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,760
Oh, it's terrible.

492
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,760
I don't recommend it.

493
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,470
Why?

494
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,470
Well,

495
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,470
for starters,

496
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,640
your life is hemmed in

497
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,640
by ancient, pointless rules.

498
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,350
There's a lot of yelling,

499
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,350
and, uh,

500
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,186
you're probably not gonna get

501
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,186
into a good country club.

502
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,812
What about God?

503
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,148
What about him?

504
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,941
Does he play a part

505
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,941
in your life?

506
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:41,154
Well, historically, he's gotten

507
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:41,154
a kick out of punishing us.

508
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,863
What about Jesus?

509
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,240
He was Jewish.

510
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,824
Oh, we've got

511
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,824
a lot of celebrities.

512
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,827
Uh, we've got, uh,

513
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,827
we got William Shatner,

514
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,246
and Leonard Nimoy...

515
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,290
Kirk<i> and</i> Spock?

516
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,000
I want to be Jewish.

517
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,627
(laughs)

518
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,627
Hold on a second.

519
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,378
Hold-- I got a question

520
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,378
for you, Sheldon.

521
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,423
When you grow up, are you

522
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,423
planning on living in Texas?

523
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,883
Probably.

524
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,512
Then I strongly advise you

525
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,512
to stay Baptist.

526
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,389
Maybe even wear a cross.

527
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,266
Why did<i> you</i> move to Texas?

528
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,934
Well, that's simple.

529
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,355
Medford had no Jews,

530
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,355
so there was an opening for one.

531
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,607
And you got it? Good for you.

532
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,817
(Ira chuckles)

533
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:21,027
I love this kid.

534
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,446
Me, too.

535
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,905
Mwah.

536
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:33,623
Hey.

537
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,333
How's it going?

538
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:39,337
Good. Did you know that

539
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:39,337
Zoroaster believed in two gods?

540
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,381
No, I did not.

541
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,381
And the Taoists

542
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,841
don't believe in God at all.

543
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,884
They believe

544
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,884
in a principle of harmony.

545
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,469
How very nice for them.

546
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,596
Shelly, I understand

547
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,596
you enjoy researching things.

548
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:49,806
Love it.

549
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:52,600
But it's important

550
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:52,600
to keep in mind

551
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,019
that there is only one true God.

552
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,021
That's called monotheism.

553
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:00,650
I have a book about it

554
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:00,650
if you're interested.

555
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:04,654
That's okay,

556
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:04,654
I have<i> the</i> book about it.

557
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:09,158
Would you be angry with me

558
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:09,158
if I don't pick your religion?

559
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,829
I could never be angry with you.

560
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:18,125
You be a seeker

561
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:18,125
of your own truth.

562
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,795
Thanks, Mom.

563
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,300
And if the truth turns out

564
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,300
to be Satan,

565
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,636
I will do battle with him.

566
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,764
(insects chirping)

567
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,201
MALE VOICE:

568
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,201
Welcome, Sheldon.

569
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,538
FEMALE VOICE: We've been

570
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,538
waiting for you.

571
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,124
Are you the Ten Commandments?

572
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,292
No.

573
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,627
We are one.

574
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,420
And zero.

575
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,213
We are the binary code

576
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,466
that underlies

577
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,466
the universe.

578
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,552
The ten thing is

579
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,552
a common mistake.

580
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:12,263
I want to understand God.

581
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,640
Can you help me?

582
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,600
Did you not hear

583
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,600
what we just said?

584
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,311
It's a binary universe.

585
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,729
God is yes and no.

586
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,188
Left and right.

587
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,482
On and off.

588
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,900
Something and nothing.

589
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,902
Positive and negative.

590
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:26,945
Male and female.

591
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,237
Light and dark.

592
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,616
But why is there

593
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,616
evil and suffering?

594
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,075
Well, without evil

595
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,075
and suffering,

596
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,953
there is no good

597
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,953
and happiness.

598
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,664
Oh, sure. Binary.

599
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,959
Shall we give him the

600
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,959
final piece of information

601
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,503
that unlocks the secret

602
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,503
of the universe?

603
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,296
Why not?

604
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,758
At least one human being should

605
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,758
know the reason for everything.

606
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,217
Sheldon,

607
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,513
before the

608
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,513
universe began...

609
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,890
GEORGE JR.:

610
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,890
<i>Hey, dummy.</i>

611
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,934
You're drooling

612
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,934
all over your books.

613
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,854
Huh? No.

614
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:05,023
Zero was about to tell me

615
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:05,023
the secret and you ruined it.

616
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,652
ADULT SHELDON:<i> I never heard</i>

617
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,652
<i>from One and Zero again.</i>

618
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:12,031
<i>Although, I was once visited</i>

619
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:12,031
<i>by Nine when I had chickenpox.</i>

620
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:16,202
<i>He was a lot less funny</i>

621
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:16,202
<i>than he thought he was.</i>

622
00:17:16,242 --> 00:17:20,790
PASTOR JEFF:

623
00:17:16,242 --> 00:17:20,790
Okay, "What God means to me."

624
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,458
Who'd like to go first?

625
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,501
Billy.

626
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,752
I'd like to go third.

627
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,797
All righty.

628
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,215
Who's feeling brave?

629
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,341
Missy.

630
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,051
I'll go second.

631
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,221
Great. Does anybody want

632
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,221
to go first?

633
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,263
I'll go.

634
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,807
Okay. Come on up here,

635
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,807
Sheldon.

636
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:40,018
Let's hear what you got.

637
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,187
I've spent the last week

638
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,856
studying what people believe,

639
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,566
and I've come to a conclusion.

640
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,942
And what's that?

641
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,861
I'm starting my own religion.

642
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:50,904
I'm sorry, what?

643
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,780
I'm calling it Mathology.

644
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,324
It's based

645
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,324
on a universal binary system.

646
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:58,327
That's terrific, Sheldon, but

647
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:58,327
this is a Baptist Sunday school.

648
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,747
I know, I'm here

649
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,747
to convert everybody.

650
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,456
Any takers?

651
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,456
Okay.

652
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,542
PASTOR JEFF: Let's go have

653
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,542
a talk with your mom.

654
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,712
The only sin in Mathology

655
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,712
is being stupid.

656
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,429
Welcome to the Church

657
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,429
of Mathology.

658
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,514
Today, I'd like to talk

659
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,514
about prime numbers,

660
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,683
and why they bring us joy.

661
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,810
Hallelujah!

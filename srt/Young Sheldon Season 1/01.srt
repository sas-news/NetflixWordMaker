197
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:19,968
(clears throat)

198
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,595
Hello.

199
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,847
Philippians 4:8,

200
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,599
"Finally, brothers,

201
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,599
whatever is..."

202
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,267
Do you have

203
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,267
evil thoughts?

204
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,602
I'm having one

205
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,602
right now.

206
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,229
Really? What is it?

207
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,606
When we get home, I'm gonna

208
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,606
kick your little balls.

209
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:36,151
You can't.

210
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:36,151
They haven't descended yet.

211
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,486
Mom?

212
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,486
What?

213
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,989
When should I be expecting

214
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,989
my testicles?

215
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,157
"...whatever

216
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,157
is admirable..."

217
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,367
What is wrong with him?

218
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,203
Nothin' is wrong with him.

219
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:49,039
Now, turn around before

220
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:49,039
I knock your lights out.

221
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,708
PASTOR: ...think continually

222
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,708
on these things.

223
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,001
A good thought

224
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,001
leads

225
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,711
to a good thing.

226
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,463
You feel it in your body.

227
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,463
You feel it in your...

236
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,191
Shelly, it's your last day

237
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,191
of summer. Go out and enjoy it.

238
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,359
But I have to learn

239
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,359
the student handbook.

240
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,654
Ooh, did you know

241
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,654
extreme hairstyles,

00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,073
goatees and mustaches

243
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,073
are not allowed?

244
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:26,367
I didn't.

245
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:26,367
I personally find

246
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:26,367
that very reassuring.

247
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,703
Look what a beautiful day it is.

Go play.

"Go play"-- if only

253
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:46,096
life were that simple.

254
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,271
There, I played.

255
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:55,314
Hey, Sheldon!

256
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,356
Hello, Billy Sparks.

257
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,526
Hello, Matilda Sparks.

258
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,526
I heard

259
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,820
you're going

260
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,820
to high school tomorrow.

261
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,820
I am.

262
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,780
You're going to have

263
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,780
to find someone else

264
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,532
to torment on the playground.

265
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,575
"Torment"?

266
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,703
(sighs)

267
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,703
It means to maliciously harass.

268
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,330
"Her ass"?

269
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,330
(chuckles)

270
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,831
That's funny.

271
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,624
Well, this was nice.

272
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,126
Hey, doofus!

273
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,336
(squawks)

274
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,920
Mom!

275
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:22,423
Good girl.

276
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:22,423
Mom!

MARY: What am I supposed to do?

278
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,634
His feet are growing.

279
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,553
GEORGE SR.: Why can't

280
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,553
he wear Georgie's old shoes?

281
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,888
MARY: He won't

282
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,888
hold your hand.

283
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,097
You think he's gonna

284
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,097
put his feet

285
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,807
in his brother's smelly shoes?

286
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,184
GEORGE SR.: Well, we damn well

287
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,184
better cut back somewhere.

288
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:34,061
MARY: Will you please keep

289
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:34,061
your voice down?

290
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,270
(door shuts)

291
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,564
They're fighting

292
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,564
about you again.

293
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,733
They're fighting about money.

294
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,236
It's a common argument

295
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,236
in marriages.

296
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,862
(door opens)

297
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,530
Lights out.

298
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,282
Big day tomorrow.

299
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,450
Mom?

300
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,702
Hmm?

301
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,954
Do we have financial problems?

302
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,665
Don't you worry about that.

303
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,167
We are fine.

304
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,669
Now, go to sleep.

305
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,296
(sighs)

306
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,882
She's lying. She just said that

307
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,882
to make you feel better.

308
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,301
Mom doesn't lie.

309
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,886
Sure, she thinks

310
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,512
the Earth was made in six days,

311
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:13,850
but that's 'cause

312
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:13,850
she's gullible, not a liar.

313
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,604

314
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,604
<i>Mom,</i>

315
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,856
Sheldon can't find his bowtie.

316
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,776
Really? I laid it out for him.

317
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,028
Leave it alone, Mary.

318
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,028
He doesn't need a bowtie.

319
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,614
It's his first day of school.

320
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,614
Let him wear what he wants.

321
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,241
SHELDON:

322
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,241
Mom, I can't

323
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,241
find my bowtie!

324
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:32,202
Dear Lord, why's he

325
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:32,202
got to wear a bowtie?

326
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,746
Can I drive in with you?

327
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,623
Sure.

328
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,292
Everybody's gonna know

329
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,292
he's your brother.

330
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,834
It's gonna be awful for you.

331
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,086
Tell her to shut up.

332
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,837
She's not wrong.

333
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,423
(TV plays quietly)

334
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,300
It's got to be here.

335
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,300
SHELDON:

336
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,300
It's not.

337
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,261
It's not!

338
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,261
Shelly, stay calm.

339
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,261
We'll find it.

340
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,721
My tie is gone!

341
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,721
My tie is gone!

342
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,721
Shelly,

343
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,556
you don't really need a tie.

344
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,434
I have to find my tie.

345
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,434
I have to find my tie.

346
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,228
Be right back.

347
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,855
Professor Proton wears a bowtie!

348
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,150
George Junior,

349
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,735
give me back that

350
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,735
bowtie right now!

351
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,735
I didn't take it!

352
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,696
Don't you lie to me!

353
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,696
I'm not lying!

354
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,908
We'll see about that.

355
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,908
Stay out of my room!

356
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,743
She's gonna find

357
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,743
your dirty magazines.

358
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,078
Shut up!

359
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,247
You are not having a good day.

Hey. Hey,

365
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,969
he didn't take it.

366
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,261
Then what

367
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,261
happened to it?!

368
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,429
SHELDON:

369
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,429
Help me find my bowtie!

I'll check in

371
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:35,515
the bathroom!

372
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,933
I took it.

373
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,227
Why would you do that?

374
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,227
Mary,

375
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,813
the boy is nine years old

376
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,813

377
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,231
Isn't that weird enough?

378
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,816
Give it to me.

379
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,816
Come on.

380
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,276
It's not just Sheldon.

383
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,988
Not in the bathroom!

384
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,781

to play a driving game?

392
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,839
Not really. I always lose.

393
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,966
I know. That's why it's fun.

Yeah.

419

That boy has

an exposed tattoo.

421
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,258
He does.

that's in violation

00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:59,057
Speaking of which, how

426
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:59,057
about we lose the bowtie?

427
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,808
Why?

428
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,353
Look around, honey. None of the

429
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,353
other kids are wearing one.

430
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,355
Well, perhaps I'll start a fad.

431
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,566
No, you won't.

432
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,566
Please trust Mommy.

433
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,026
All right,

434
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,026
tell you what.

435
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,695
You take it off,

436
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,695
and this weekend,

437
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,031
I'll take you to RadioShack.

438
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,450
Hmm?

439
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,618

00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,126
You doing okay?

443
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,211
I guess.

(roars)

445
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,880
I smell ammonia.

446
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,341
They must've done

447
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,341
a thorough cleaning recently.

448
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,093
I like that.

00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,721
bothers you, what do you say?

451
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,681
My dad's a football coach.

452
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,809
And?

453
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,809
My brother's a football player.

454
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,060
Good.

455
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,437
Hey, Mom, look.

456
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,730
That girl's pregnant.

(toilet flushing)

459
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,030
Well, that was revolting.

460
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,698
All right.

461
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,698
This is your homeroom.

462
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,367
Do you want me

463
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,367
to go in with you?

464
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,287
No. Although I could've used you

465
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,287
in the restroom.

466
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,456
Okay, well...

467
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:05,706
You have a good day.

468
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,250
And I'll pick you up

469
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,250
after school,

470
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,918
same door we came in.

471
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,546
Are you crying or having

472
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,546
an allergy attack?

473
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,840
Allergies.

474
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,425
It's probably the ammonia.

475
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,344
Probably.

476
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,344
(sniffles)

477
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,472
Okay. Let the learning begin.

00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:33,901
All right, everybody,

480
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:33,901
my name is Ms. MacElroy.

481
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,070
In addition to being

482
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,070
your homeroom teacher,

483
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,865
I'll be seeing some of you

484
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,865
in my English class,

485
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,867
and some of you

486
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,867
on the volleyball court.

487
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,661
Just to give you

488
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,661
a little history,

489
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,787
I've been here at Medford

490
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,787
for 29 years...

491
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,289
(mouthing)

492
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,291
...I taught some of your

493
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,291
older brothers and sisters,

494
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,335
and sadly,

495
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,335
some of your parents.

496
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,380
Not much I haven't seen.

497
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,423
Until today.

498
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,635
I'm sure you're well aware

499
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,635
we have a student with us,

500
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,679
who, despite his young age,

501
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,972
is remarkably gifted.

502
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:06,142
And I expect y'all

503
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:06,142
to make him feel welcome.

504
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,478
Yes, Sheldon?

505
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,022
Per the student dress

506
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,022
and grooming code,

507
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,940
this boy's hair is too long,

508
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,942
this boy is wearing

509
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,942
sports attire

510
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,277
outside

511
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,277
of a designated area

512
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,779
and this girl's blouse

513
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,779
is diaphanous,

514
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,700
which means

515
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,700
I can see her brassiere.

516
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,826
(laughter)

517
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,826
Thank you.

518
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,662
I will take that

519
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,662
into account.

520
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,080
All right.

521
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,290
We have a few minutes

522
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,290
before first period.

523
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,209
I need y'all

524
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,209
to fill out these forms.

525
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,377
What?

526
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,628
Also in violation

527
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,714
of the grooming code

528
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,714
on page 48,

529
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,756
article five, subsection B,

530
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,884
you have a bit of a mustache.

531
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,177
(laughter)

532
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,305
This is a stupid idea.

533
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,305
This boy does not

534
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,890
belong in our school.

535
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,642
PETERSEN: Come on Vicky,

536
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,642
it's just the first day.

537
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,852
Why don't we all just take

538
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,852
a deep breath here?

539
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,021
The hell with that. Five

540
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,021
minutes into my math class,

541
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,940
he questioned my credentials.

542
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,609
How am I supposed to control a

543
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,609
classroom when a kid accuses me

544
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,444
of being in breach

545
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,444
of the hygiene code?

546
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,279
Well, Hubert, it wouldn't

547
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,279
kill you to shower

548
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,780
a little more often. George,

549
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,780
you want to weigh in here?

550
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,533
Well...

551
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,533
INGRAM:

552
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,533
Oral Roberts University

553
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:04,992
is a wonderful school.

554
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,620
He said I was intimidated

555
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,620
by his intelligence,

556
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:07,746
and then,

557
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:10,582
he offered to be my "leader."

558
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,459
(clears throat)

559
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,793
(playing Mozart's Sonata in D)

560
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,197
(piano playing)

561
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:55,794
(stops playing)

562
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,420
Do you know

563
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,420
this sonata?

564
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,755
No.

565
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,799
How long have you

566
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,799
played the piano?

567
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,510
I don't play piano.

568
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,886
PETERSEN:

569
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,886
<i>George,</i>

570
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,347
you got any thoughts here?

571
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,682
I certainly do.

572
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,850
Mary, tell him.

573
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,813
It's simple.

574
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,813
We don't have a choice.

575
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,356
Well, you gave it a shot.

576
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,274
We wish you luck

577
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,274
with Sheldon elsewhere...

578
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,900
MARY:

579
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,900
No, no, no.

580
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,361
We don't have a choice.

581
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,487
He's got to stay here.

582
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,697
We can't afford

583
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:24,947
private school.

584
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,700
I sure can't

585
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,700
homeschool him.

586
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,785
He's doing calculus and

587
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,785
Euclidean something or other.

588
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,077
Euclidean geometry.

589
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,538
Guess where I learned that.

590
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,873
Yeah, yeah, we know.

591
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,709
All I care about

592
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,709
is that

593
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,670
my son gets the education

594
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,670
he deserves, so you all

595
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:39,962
are gonna have to

596
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:39,962
figure this out.

597
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,506
Coach, can you help me out here,

598
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,506
please?

599
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,049
'Cause I'm dyin'.

600
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,347
I'd rather not.

601
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,310
G minor.

602
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,689
F.

603
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,024
E flat.

604
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,069
C minor.

605
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,947
You have perfect pitch.

606
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,449
Okay.

607
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:12,078
Sweetheart, you should

608
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:12,078
really pursue music.

609
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,914
No, thank you.

610
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,914
Musicians take drugs.

611
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,918
Is there a faculty

612
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,918
restroom I could use?

613
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,338
(whistle blows)

614
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,964
♪ Ooh... ♪

615
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,132
(grunting)

616
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,177
♪ Ooh... ♪

617
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,392
Cooper, Stinson, you're up.

618
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,854
(laughs) Hey, look,

619
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,854
it's the dumb brother.

620
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,316
Okay.

621
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,316
(blows whistle)

622
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,113
(grunting, yelling)

623
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,322
(whistle blowing)

624
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,574
BERGDOFF:

625
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,574
That's enough. Hey.

626
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:50,825
(yelling)

627
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:50,825

628
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,993
BERGDOFF:

629
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,993
Hey, that's enough!

630
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,454
Hey, hey!

631
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,454
GEORGE SR.:

632
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,454
That's enough!

633
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,747
Georgie.

634
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,457
Georgie! Georgie!

635
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,999
Stop! Stop!

636
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,714
What the hell

637
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,714
is wrong with you?

638
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,509
You okay?

639
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,679
No, I'm not okay.

640
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,980
Where you think you're going?

641
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,982
I quit. I don't want

642
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,982
to play anymore!

643
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:26,486
Since when?

644
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:26,486
Since right now!

645
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,070
All right, what is going on?

646
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,823
What do you think's going on?!

647
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,325
You mean Sheldon?

648
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,955
You can't let that bother you.

649
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,414
It doesn't bother you?

650
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,249
You got called

651
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,249
to the principal's office.

652
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,042
Yeah, that wasn't so great.

653
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,920
I can't be in the same school

654
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,920
as him!

655
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,922
Well, I don't see

656
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,922
what choice you have.

657
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:49,258
Right. Ever since he could talk,

658
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:49,258
I quit having any choices.

659
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,473
(groans)

660
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,892
I know it's hard.

661
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:01,855
I'm telling you, as your coach,

662
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:01,855
quit your whining,

663
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,231
get your uniform on and you

664
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,231
get your ass back out there.

665
00:17:04,272 --> 00:17:07,233
But what about as my dad?

666
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,820
Your dad is

667
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,820
having a bad day.

668
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,198
Listen to your coach.

669
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,749
Can a clock be powered

670
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,749
by an ordinary potato?

671
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,792
I hope so, boys and girls,

672
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:27,797
or this is going to be

673
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:27,797
a really boring episode.

674
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,965
The supplies you'll need...

675
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,884
Why can't we

676
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,884
watch<i> DuckTales?</i>

677
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:34,053
'Cause we don't learn anything

678
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:34,053
watching<i> DuckTales.</i>

679
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,682
It's TV; we aren't

680
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,682
supposed to learn.

681
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,476
...two alligator grips

682
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,476
and, let's see...

683
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:43,187
Of course, a clock.

684
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,105
Missy, go somewhere else.

685
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,105
I need to talk to your brother.

686
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,692
Why don't you go somewhere else

687
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,692
and I can watch<i> Duck...</i>

688
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:48,943
Go!

689
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:52,030
I hate everybody.

690
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,866
It's time for science.

691
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,245
Hey, he was about to power

692
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,245
a clock with a potato.

693
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,872
Not possible.

694
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,999
Now, listen...

695
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,999
Am I in trouble?

696
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,376
No.

697
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,961
Maybe. Just listen.

698
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,965
You're not gonna

699
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,965
make it in this school

700
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,884
if you keep ratting

701
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,884
people out.

702
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,468
But they were breaking

703
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,468
the grooming codes

704
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,970
and the dress codes.

705
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:19,473
I saw one boy with a T-shirt

706
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:19,473
that said...

707
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,100
(whispering):

708
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,100
"Bite me."

709
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,977
Yeah. That-that's terrible.

710
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,688
Sheldon, let me tell

711
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,688
you a little story.

712
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,857
Did you ever wonder why we moved

713
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,857
from Galveston to Medford?

714
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:31,402
No. I tend to wonder

715
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:31,402
about the bigger questions.

716
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,738
Okay, well, here's why.

717
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,574
Your dad had a real good

718
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,574
coaching job

719
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,826
and I saw some grown-ups

720
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,826
breaking rules.

721
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,703
What'd they do?

722
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,956
I-It's kind of complicated,

723
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,956
but...

724
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,832
football coaches aren't allowed

725
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,832
to recruit kids

726
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,668
from other high schools

727
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,668
to play on their teams.

728
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,795
And you told on them?

729
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,421
Yeah. You know what happened?

730
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,215
Justice descended

731
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,215
upon the rule breakers?

732
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,761
I got fired, Sheldon.

733
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,763
And I got a bad

734
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,763
reputation.

735
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,641
Oh. That's why you

736
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,641
drink so much beer.

737
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,021
Just do yourself a favor.

738
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,565
Okay? Go to

739
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,565
school tomorrow,

740
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,859
and mind your own business.

741
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,360
All right?

742
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,072
Dad.

743
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,993
Are you sad that you got fired?

744
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,539
Mostly angry.

745
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,876
But yeah.

746
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,962
Maybe a little sad.

747
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:41,305
All right, let's say grace.

748
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,519
Thank you, God,

749
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,396
for this food we are

750
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,396
about to receive.

751
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,732
(muffled praying continues)

752
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,073
ADULT SHELDON:

753
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,073
<i>That was the first time</i>

754
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,908
<i>I held my father's hand.</i>

755
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,078
MARY: ...our bodies and bless

756
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,078
the hands that prepared it.

757
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,705
Amen.

758
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,165
GEORGIE: Amen.

759
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,165
Amen.

760
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:12,962
MARY: Hey, George Jr.,

761
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:12,962
wait your turn.

762
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,672
ADULT SHELDON:<i> I wouldn't</i>

763
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,672
<i>touch my brother's hand</i>

764
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,757
<i>until 17 years later,</i>

765
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,511
<i>thanks to the invention</i>

766
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,511
<i>of Purell.</i>

767
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,482
You know what I find comforting?

768
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:34,775
What's that, baby?

769
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,277
In a world filled

770
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,277
with uncertainty,

771
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,030
this place will be here forever.

772
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:44,702
CLERK: Hey, Sheldon,

773
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:44,702
how you doing?

00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:04,254
ADULT SHELDON:

2
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:04,254
<i>On any given day,</i>

3
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:06,298
<i>our school gymnasium</i>

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,510
<i>presented</i>

5
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,510
<i>a cocktail of horrors.</i>

6
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,552
(screams)

7
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:13,764
<i>From daily humiliation...</i>

8
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,893
<i>...to school-sanctioned</i>

9
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,893
<i>violence...</i>

10
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,520
BOY:

11
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,520
Oh!

12
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,523
<i>But one day a year,</i>

13
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,523
<i>the gymnasium was transformed</i>

14
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,692
<i>into a haven of learning</i>

15
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,068
<i>thanks to a remarkable</i>

16
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,068
<i>institution</i>

17
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,112
<i>known as the science fair.</i>

18
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,907
<i>A chance for the student body</i>

19
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,907
<i>to come together</i>

20
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,326
<i>in the name of research</i>

21
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,326
<i>and progress.</i>

22
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,953
<i>Uh, while some did</i>

23
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,953
<i>the bare minimum...</i>

24
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:37,204
(burps)

25
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:43,335
<i>...and others preferred</i>

26
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:43,335
<i>razzamatazz over raw data,</i>

27
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:47,046
<i>I set out to save humanity</i>

28
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:47,046
<i>from deadly asteroids.</i>

29
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,550
<i>And made it all neatly fit</i>

30
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,550
<i>on three poster boards.</i>

31
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:53,094
<i>The science fair may be</i>

32
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:53,094
<i>a competition,</i>

33
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:56,390
<i>but when the goal is promoting</i>

34
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:56,390
<i>knowledge, we're all winners.</i>

35
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,725
PETERSEN:

36
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,725
And the winner

37
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,769
of the Medford High School

38
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,769
Science Fair is...

39
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:03,146
SueAnn Ludlow!

40
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,815
You've got to be kidding me!

41
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:05,983
Shelly.

42
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:07,067
(applause)

43
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,986
You people are crazy!

44
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:10,654
Hey.

45
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:10,654
All right.

46
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:11,697
SHELDON:

47
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:11,697
You're celebrating mediocrity!

48
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:12,823
(mouths)

49
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:14,408
Mediocrity!

50
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,159
Mediocrity!

51
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,372

00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,372

Oh, come on, Shelly.

59
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,433
You still got

60
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,433
an honorable mention.

61
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,060
Stop reminding me.

62
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,269
(sighs)

63
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,438
I hate to see him

64
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,438
so upset.

65
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,899
Well, give him a little

66
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,899
time, he'll calm down.

67
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:48,067
(door slams)

68
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,860
SHELDON:

69
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,860
Fiddle-faddle!

70
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,028
The F word.

71
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,613
He's real mad.

72
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,782
You don't always win in life,

73
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,782
he needs to learn that.

74
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,951
I know, but these are

75
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,951
big feelings for a little boy.

76
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,285
They're feelings everybody has.

77
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,745
It's part of growing up.

78
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:00,871
I guess.

79
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,623
SHELDON:

80
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,623
Poodle poop!

81
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,832
MEEMAW:

82
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,832
Okay.

83
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,084
Somebody's got to teach

84
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,962
this kid to swear,

85
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,962
it's embarrassing.

86
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,175
Sheldon, listen,

87
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,761
I know losing

88
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,761
ain't easy.

89
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,512
I deal with it on the

90
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,512
football field all the time.

91
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,640
(chuckles)

92
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,186
It's like that big game we had

93
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,186
last year against Nacogdoches.

94
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,899
We were down 28 points

95
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,899
at the half.

96
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:30,525
It was raining, it was muddy.

97
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,736
Everybody in the stands

98
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,736
had gone home.

99
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,030
But somehow,

100
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,030
we managed to claw our way back

101
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,865
to a tie with a minute left.

102
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,242
And then, they threw

103
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,242
a Hail Mary,

104
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,452
and the receiver stepped

105
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,452
out of bounds,

106
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,454
but the ref didn't see it.

107
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:46,917
After all that,

108
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:46,917
we lose on a bad call.

109
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,004
Believe me, I was furious.

110
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,297
But I sucked it up,

111
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:56,135
and I walked across that field

112
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:56,135
and I shook their hands.

113
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:59,554
I didn't hear a word you said.

114
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:02,933
Okay.

115
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:05,644
So while an animal cell

116
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:05,644
has a membrane,

117
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,772
a plant cell has a membrane

118
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,772
and a cell wall.

119
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,482
SHELDON:

120
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,482
Who cares?

121
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,109
Sheldon,

122
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,109
what are you doing?

123
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:14,153
Being disrespectful, sir.

124
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,737
Ah. How come?

125
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,657
Because I'm disillusioned

126
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,657
with the school system.

127
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,326
Georgie, do you know

128
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,326
what's going on with him?

129
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,704
Actually, I'm trying

130
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,704
to ignore it.

131
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,956
Well, get your feet

132
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,956
off the desk.

133
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,749
What if I don't?

134
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,418
I was sent to see

135
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,418
Principal Petersen.

136
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,837
What is it this time?

137
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,254
Youthful rebellion.

138
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,175
My voice hasn't changed yet,

139
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,175
but my attitude has.

140
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,718
I'll let him know you're here.

141
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,511
You do that.

142
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,055
Ma'am.

143
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,266
(door closes)

144
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,728
Sheldon Cooper's outside.

145
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,730
Who sent him now?

146
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,981
Givens.

147
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,981
Well, you know what?

148
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,525
Givens needs to man up.

149
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,735
Cooper's

150
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,735
a little boy.

151
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,070
It's not hard to handle him.

152
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,071
I'll send him in.

153
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,739
H-Hold on a minute, just...

154
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,281
Does he know I'm in here?

155
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,410
SHELDON (over P.A.):

156
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,410
Attention, students and faculty.

157
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,703
Oh, no.

158
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,454
This is Sheldon Lee Cooper.

159
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,373
What the hell?

160
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,753
We're taught that hard work

161
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,753
pays off, but that's not true.

162
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,629
I came up with a solution

163
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,629
to save Earth

164
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,839
from killer asteroids,

165
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,175
and lost the science fair

166
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,802
to SueAnn Ludlow,

167
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,802
and her frizzy hair machine.

168
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,972
But it wasn't just me who lost,

169
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,972
we all lost.

170
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,099
Wake up, people.

171
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,768
The system's broken.

172
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,937
Real innovation isn't valued.

173
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:33,065
Nowadays, it's all about

174
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:33,065
flash and style.

175
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,399
I blame MTV.

176
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,236
Luckily, my parents

177
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,236
can't afford cable.

178
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,863
We can afford it.

179
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,949
I urge you all to rise up.

180
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,158
(grunts)

181
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,325
They can't send everyone

182
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,410
to the principal's office.

183
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,536
Chew gum in class,

184
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:47,955
use a number one pencil,

185
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,414
go nuts.

186
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,125
This is Sheldon Lee Cooper

187
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,125
signing off.

188
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,543
Live long and prosper.

189
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,254
You better run, you little punk!

190
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,423
(grunting)

191
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,676
MEEMAW:<i> I can't believe you sent</i>

192
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,676
<i>him to bed without his dinner.</i>

193
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,803
That's right.

194
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,304
On spaghetti and

195
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,304
hot dog night.

196
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,014
That's rough.

197
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,014
He's got to learn.

198
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,100
Let's talk about something else.

199
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,768
Georgie, how was your day?

200
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,520
My brother told the entire

201
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,520
school we can't afford cable.

202
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,773
Oh, right. Missy?

203
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,234
Good, until I learned

204
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,234
we can't afford cable.

205
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,153
(sighs)

206
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,947
I've been thinking, and there's

207
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,947
something I'd like to say.

208
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,324
Unless it's an apology,

209
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,324
I don't want to hear it.

210
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,952
I'm quitting science.

211
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,329
Not an apology.

212
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,372
Spank him, Dad.

213
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,922
I'm really getting

214
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,922
worried about Shelly.

215
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,133
Acting out,

216
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,133
and now quitting science?

217
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,302
Oh, I'm sure he'll get

218
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,302
right back to it.

219
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,138
I've quit smoking and gambling

220
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,138
plenty of times.

221
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,764
Hmm. Look in my purse.

222
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,891
Nothing but cigarettes

223
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,891
and scratchers. (laughs)

224
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,686
(sighs) Maybe he should

225
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,686
talk to somebody.

226
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,687
Not it.

227
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,772
I meant a professional, George.

228
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,816
But way to be a dad.

229
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,327
(door opens)

230
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,870
Hey.

231
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,870
(chuckles)

232
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,454
Welcome back.

233
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,915
Thank you for seeing us

234
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,915
on such short notice, Doctor.

235
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,292
Oh, not a problem.

236
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:16,375
Sheldon,

237
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,460
I remember you.

238
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,503
Do you remember me?

239
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,339
I remember everything.

240
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,798
Okay.

241
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,424
Uh, you two, make

242
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,424
yourselves comfortable.

243
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,926
Me and my main man Sheldon

244
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,926
are gonna go

245
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,594
have a little chitchat

246
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,594
in my office.

247
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,306
I don't like chitchat,

248
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,306
and I'm not your main man.

249
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:31,183
Right on.

250
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,684
Have fun.

251
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,770
(door closes)

252
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,232
Now, Sheldon, I understand

253
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,232
you've changed your mind

254
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,816
about being a scientist.

255
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,152
And you're gonna

256
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,152
say I can't?

257
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,112
No. I think that's great.

258
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,989
You do?

259
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,989
Yeah.

260
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,575
I think it's important

261
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,575
to keep your options open.

262
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,993
Let me tell you a little story

263
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,246
about an extremely smart

264
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,246
young boy.

265
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,496
Me?

266
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,706
Me.

267
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:55,957
For the longest time,

268
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,958
I thought I was gonna be

269
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,626
a professional figure skater.

270
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,213
And then you became disenchanted

271
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,213
with the field like I did?

272
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,381
Exactly.

273
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,216
Someone skated

274
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,216
right over my foot.

275
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,466
And that was that.

276
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,469
I'm not sure

277
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,469
that's the same thing.

278
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:12,266
I'd say you lost your passion

279
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:12,266
the way I lost my big toe.

280
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,184
Hmm.

281
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,898
Don't draw in that.

282
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,109
Hey. We're all done.

283
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,194
How'd it go?

284
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,194
Great.

285
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,904
I feel a lot better.

286
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,447
Well, that's

287
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,447
just wonderful.

288
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,324
So, you're going back

289
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,324
to science?

290
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:33,161
No. In fact, I'm going as far

291
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:33,161
away from science as possible.

292
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,038
I plan to pursue the arts.

293
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,915
What kind of arts?

294
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,959
I've decided to become an actor.

295
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,837
Of course you have.

296
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,425
Why's he want to study acting?

297
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,136
The doctor encouraged him

298
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,136
to try something different.

299
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,054
Maybe he'll learn

300
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,054
to act normal.

301
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,806
How about you learn

302
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,806
to act nice?

303
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,475
You people don't appreciate

304
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,475
my sense of humor.

305
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,475
(chuckles)

306
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,769
As long as he starts behaving

307
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,769
himself in school,

308
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,729
I don't care what he does.

309
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,190
You know, I actually did

310
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,190
a little community theater

311
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,358
back in my 20s.

312
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,484
Is that so?

313
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,653
I had a good part

314
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,653
in<i> Oklahoma.</i>

315
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,614
♪ I'm just a girl

316
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,614
who can't say no. ♪

317
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,740
Say no to what?

318
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:11,908
Well...

319
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,910
To, uh, eating

320
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,910
her vegetables.

321
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,787
It was fun.

322
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,538
But I'm pretty sure

323
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,538
doing plays

324
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,541
is just an excuse to change in

325
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,541
front of each other backstage.

326
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,169
Really?

327
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,169
Yeah.

328
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,963
Theater folk just love to

329
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,963
take their clothes off.

330
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,340
How many people

331
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,340
saw you naked?

332
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,548
A lot.

333
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,800
Mom.

334
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,800
Enough.

335
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,469
Y'all don't understand

336
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,720
my sense of humor, either.

337
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,184
(indistinct chatter)

338
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,982
Hello. Are you Mr. Lundy?

339
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,026
My father is Mr. Lundy.

340
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,902
Well, then what should

341
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,902
I call you?

342
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,281
I guess Mr. Lundy.

343
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,949
My father's dead. (laughs)

344
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,036
I was told you're the head

345
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,036
of the drama department.

346
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,746
Mm-hmm, and the girls'

347
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,746
volleyball coach,

348
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,042
which, between us,

349
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,042
is the real drama department.

350
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,293
Was that a joke?

351
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,253
I thought so.

352
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,382
Can I help you?

353
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,301
I'm interested

354
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,301
in becoming an actor.

355
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,303
Well, good for you.

356
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:14,971
You've come to the right place.

357
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,349
You know, I-I've been

358
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,349
a professional actor

359
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,641
for years and years.

360
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,435
Really? What have you been in?

361
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,854
Well, have you seen

362
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,854
the mattress madness commercials

363
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,231
on channel 68?

364
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,900
I'm soft and firm

365
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,070
in all the right places.

366
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,490
Wow. You're famous.

367
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:34,824
Well, I...

368
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,244
And I was Carbucketty

369
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,080
in the Dallas-Fort Worth

370
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,080
Players production of<i> Cats.</i>

371
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,164
(purrs)

372
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,041
(laughs) Did you see that?

373
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,959
No, I'm afraid of cats.

374
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,712
Well, you realize the cats

375
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,712
are just the actors.

376
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,089
I still wouldn't risk it.

377
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,925
You're an odd boy,

378
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,925
but you make it work.

379
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,134
(chuckles)

380
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,303
Anyway, uh,

381
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,303
auditions are next week.

382
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,180
You're welcome to come on by.

383
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,180
Excellent.

384
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,848
I checked out a book on acting

385
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,517
so I should have the hang of it

386
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,517
by then.

387
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,270

According to the story,

435
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:22,223
it was given to me by a friend

436
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:25,143
so I could afford to stay in

00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,770

00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:35,778

00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,030
I'm an actor.

445
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,406
You're a freak.

446
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,743

00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,743

What?

461
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,692

462
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,692
"break a leg."

463
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,109
Sorry.

464
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,028

<i>Annie.</i>

I need to go learn my lines.

520
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,324
Now, I was a little unsure

521
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,324
at first,

522
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,327
but Sandy Duncan does

523
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,327
play Peter Pan,

524
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,829
so when you think about it...

525
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,746
Connie, you're not helping.

526
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,373
Okay.

527
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,041
(sighs)

528
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,049
Hey.

529
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,426
Hello.

530
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,179
(sighs) I want to talk to you

531
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,179
about this play.

532
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,889
I'm excited about it, too.

533
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,975
You know, if you play

534
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,975
the part of a girl,

535
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,811
people might make fun of you.

536
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,479
Mr. Lundy's trying

537
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,479
to push the boundaries

538
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,439
of drama in East Texas.

539
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,693
One way to do that

540
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,693
is cross-gender casting.

541
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,319
Let me rephrase that:

542
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,654
if you play the part of a girl,

543
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,656
people<i> will</i> make fun of you.

544
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,283
In Shakespeare's time, the men

545
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,283
played all the female parts.

546
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,702
No one made fun of it.

547
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,078
If Shakespeare went

548
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,078
to public high school,

549
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,663
it'd be a different story.

550
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,164
You know, Sandy Duncan plays

551
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,164
the part of Peter Pan...

552
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,917
Yeah, yeah, I heard.

553
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,461
(exhales)

554
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,632
I'm trying to protect you, son.

555
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,634
I appreciate that.

556
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:27,844
Good.

557
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:30,179
You're a football coach.

558
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,639
Isn't it your responsibility

559
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,767
to put in the best player

560
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,767
for the job?

561
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,185
I guess.

562
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,855
Well, I want to do this,

563
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:43,025
and Mr. Lundy said

564
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:43,025
I was the best.

565
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,363
Okay.

566
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,699
Can you at least wear pants

567
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,699
instead of a dress?

568
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,159
I'll give you a definite maybe.

569
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,960
Okay, who's excited?

570
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,713
I don't want to see Sheldon's

571
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,713
stupid play, it's humiliating.

572
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,924
That's why I want to see it.

573
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,174
We're going to support

574
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,174
your brother.

575
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,552
Not another word about it.

576
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,639
Can we at least sit

577
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,639
in the back?

578
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,973
Not a word.

579
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,311
Well, I'm excited.

580
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,068
Okay, everybody,

581
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,068
ten minutes to curtain.

582
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,822
No smiling, girls,

583
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,822
it's a hard knock life.

584
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,698
How you doing,

585
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,698
Mr. Cooper?

586
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,659
You in touch with

587
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,659
your inner Annie?

588
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,201
I believe so.

589
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,745
Good. It's a packed house.

590
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:36,913
(laughs)

591
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,205
Wha-- oh, what the heck?

592
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,500
Katie? Katie.

593
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,500
You're an orphan,

594
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,042
sweetheart, not a coal miner.

595
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,337
Let's tone that down, hmm?

596
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,006
(indistinct chatter)

597
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,051
(heart beating rapidly)

598
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,225
♪ ♪

599
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,269
Oh, dear.

600
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,896
I can't do this.

601
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:02,981
What are you talking about?

602
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,023
The play,

603
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,023
I can't do it.

604
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,651
There are

605
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,651
too many people out there.

606
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:07,902
Oh, that is just stage fright.

607
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,820
That's completely normal.

608
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,365
No, this is a full-blown

609
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,365
panic attack.

610
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,491
All right, listen to me.

611
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,867
You're feeling scared.

612
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:18,162
I get that,

613
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:18,162
but what you have to understand

614
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,707
is you're not going out

615
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,707
on that stage alone.

616
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,750
Everybody, gather around, hmm?

617
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,544
Uh, Sheldon,

618
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,921
have you ever been

619
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,921
to the circus?

620
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:27,755
Yes.

621
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:28,923
Okay, good.

622
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,383
I had a panic attack there, too.

623
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,802
My point is,

624
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:36,848
the trapeze artist

625
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:36,848
always performs with a net

626
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,266
to catch him,

627
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,266
to protect him.

628
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:43,938
And you are protected

629
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:43,938
by everyone standing here.

630
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,067
Nothing can happen to

631
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,067
you out on that stage,

632
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,777
because we're a team.

633
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:53,280
We are your net.

634
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,408
I don't know.

635
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,617
(sighs)

636
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,578
Sheldon, come here.

637
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:00,788
You...

638
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,999
are a star,

639
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,668
and that audience

640
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:10,464
deserves to see you shine.

641
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,469

<i>of Little Orphan Annie.</i>

649

You're looking for

650
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,191
a knuckle sandwich.

651
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:33,404
<i>And in that respect,</i>

652
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:33,404

653
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,531
Pipe down, all of you.

654
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,199
Go back to sleep.

655
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,035
It's all right, Molly.

656
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,037
Annie's here.

657
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,663

658
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,164
Oh, thank God.

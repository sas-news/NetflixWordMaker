00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,997
into our house.

196
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,372
How the hell did he do that?

197
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,125
He pushed in a screen window.

198
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,584
You think he chewed

199
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,584
through the fence again?

200
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:35,585
All I know

201
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,087
is Sheldon's yelling at the dog,

202
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,546
and Mary's yelling at me.

203
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,008
Now I'm looking at you

204
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,008
in your underwear.

205
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,884
BRENDA: Damn it, Herschel,

206
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,884
what is going on?

207
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,343
Oh, hey, George.

208
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,386
Hey, Brenda.

209
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,345
Bucky got in their house.

210
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,973
That's funny.

211
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,934
It might be funny one day,

212
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,934
not right now.

213
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,435
Look, I'm real sorry, George.

214
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,188
I'll keep him tied up,

215
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,188
it won't happen again.

216
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,230
Y'all have a good night.

217
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,606
MARY:

218
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,606
George!

219
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,026
You are not gonna

220
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,026
believe this. Look.

221
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,820
Their dog left a dead squirrel

222
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,820
in our living room.

223
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,822
Well, h-he is part hunting dog.

224
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,199
I think that means he likes you.

225
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,868
I'm not interested in

226
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,868
winning his affection.

227
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,912
I'm interested in keeping dogs

228
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,912
and rodents outside of my home.

229
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,206
BRENDA: Well,

230
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,206
now, hold on.

231
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,498
How do we know it was

232
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,498
Bucky that left

233
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,916
that squirrel

234
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,916
in your house?

235
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,710
Maybe that squirrel

236
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,710
was already there.

237
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:20,214
Why else would a dead squirrel

238
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:20,214
be in my living room?

239
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,007
I don't know what kind

240
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,007
of house you keep.

241
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:22,924
(gasps)

242
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:23,800
My house

243
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:24,926
is immaculate.

244
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,385
George, tell them.

245
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,385
Uh...

246
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,347
She does keep a nice house.

247
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,431
Honey, it's a pretty good chance

248
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,431
it was Bucky.

249
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,600
Whose side are you on?

250
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,600
Yours, always yours.

251
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,685
All right.

252
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,978
Everyone's upset, it's late.

253
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,395
Maybe we should drop

254
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,395
this for tonight?

255
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,357
That's a good idea. Okay.

256
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,774
You just keep your dog

257
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,774
away from my son.

258
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,526
There you go

259
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,526
picking it up again.

260
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,526
I am sorry,

261
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,944
but their dog

262
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,944
broke into our home.

263
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,029
Something he

264
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,029
probably learned

265
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,280
from your brother.

266
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,740
How dare you.

267
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,076
Okay, I think that's

268
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,076
a good stopping point.

269
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,785
How do we know

270
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,785
that your son didn't

271
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,955
lure Bucky in to perform weird

272
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,955
science experiments on him?

273
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,999
My son was asleep in his bed,

274
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,999
and you have some nerve...

275
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,334
(squirrel chittering)

276
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:58,793
(screams)

277
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,461
Oh, oh, oh! Oh!

278
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,089
HERSCHEL:

279
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,089
Night, George!

280
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,090
Night!

281
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,508
(screeching)

282
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,346
I don't understand

283
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,346
why that dog

284
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,014
is so interested in Sheldon.

285
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,558
Maybe Bucky likes the way

286
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,558
Sheldon smells?

287
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,602
Your brother washes himself

288
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,602
three times a day.

289
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,271
He has no smell.

290
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,479
Here we go: animal control.

291
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,856
MEEMAW:

292
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,856
Oh, no, no.

293
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,817
No, you don't want

294
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,817
to go calling animal control.

295
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,945
Why not?

296
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,945
Because,

297
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,072
you have to live next door

298
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,072
to these people.

299
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:31,118
They called the cops on Georgie

300
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:31,118
when he played music too loud.

301
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,288
Maybe it was them,

302
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,288
maybe it was me.

303
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,330
Anyway, the point is,

304
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,581
you don't can't

305
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,581
go throwing

306
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,166
gasoline on the fire.

307
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,542
Well, they started this fire,

308
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,169
and now,

309
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,169
they're gonna get burned.

310
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,671
I believe you've had

311
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,671
enough coffee.

312
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,925
Listen, why don't you

313
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,925
let me talk to Brenda,

314
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,176
and just smooth things out?

315
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,510
Why do you think

316
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,510
she'll listen to you?

317
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,013
Because people like me

318
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,013
more than you.

319
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,099
People like me.

320
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,310
I didn't say they don't,

321
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,310
they just like me more.

322
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,436
Anyway,

323
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,937
I see her all the

324
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,937
time at bowling.

325
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,730
I know how to handle her.

326
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:01,940
Fine.

327
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,691
Thank you.

328
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,241
Plenty of people like me.

329
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,206
Hey, Brenda, how's it going?

330
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:21,751
Your daughter's a pain in

331
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:21,751
my ass, that's how it's going.

332
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,837
(laughs)

333
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,213
You don't beat around the bush.

334
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,382
I've always liked that

335
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,382
about you.

336
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,092
Connie, I've had a long night.

337
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,552
Unless you're looking to bowl,

338
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,552
I don't want to hear it.

339
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,096
Aw, now, come on.

340
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,722
Let me buy you a drink,

341
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,722
and we'll talk about this.

342
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,226
I'm more on your side

343
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,226
than you think.

344
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,227
Somehow,

345
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,645
I doubt that.

346
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,645
It's true.

347
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:45,400
Don't you think I realize

348
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:45,400
that Mary can be a bit...

349
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,152
Of a self-righteous bitch?

350
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,113
I was gonna say "challenging,"

351
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,113
but sure, let's go with yours.

352
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,366
It's got a nice rhythm.

353
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,327
Mmm.

354
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,786
Brenda, this is, by far,

355
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,414
the best bowling alley

356
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,414
margarita in town.

357
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,832
How long

358
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,168
you and Herschel been married?

359
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,168
18, 19 years?

360
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,670
19, but it feels like 30.

361
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,006
(chuckles) Well,

362
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,006
y'all are a great couple.

363
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,132
Eh.

364
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,967
I just wanted to thank you

365
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,470
for being so patient and kind

366
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,470
to my daughter and her family

367
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:14,846
since they moved in.

368
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,639
It's nothing.

369
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,639
No,

370
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,433
it needs to be said.

371
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,186
You know, Mary has a tough job

372
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,186
raising those three kids,

373
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,605
with one of them being,

374
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,605
you know, somewhat special.

375
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,525
I can see that.

376
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,525
Yeah.

377
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,028
And having a kind neighbor makes

378
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,028
all the difference in the world.

379
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,363
Well, we try.

380
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:34,574
And I know you know

381
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:34,574
how stressful it is,

382
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,451
seeing as how you have

383
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,451
your own child

384
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,454
who is special in his own way.

385
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,122
What's that supposed to mean?

386
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:45,293
Well, I mean, hey, I know

387
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:45,293
Billy is a terrific little boy,

388
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,505
but I am sure he has presented

389
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,505
you and Herschel

390
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,215
with some challenges.

391
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,217
If there's a weird kid

392
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,217
in the neighborhood,

393
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,760
it's your grandson.

394
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:57,680
Now, hang on, I said

395
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:57,680
"special," not "weird."

396
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,890
I heard you.

397
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,141
I said "weird."

398
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,060
Okay, see now, Brenda,

399
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,978
you don't want to go calling

400
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,978
my grandson weird

401
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,523
when I've just treated you

402
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,523
to a margarita<i> grande.</i>

403
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,900
Well, I'm sorry,

404
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,900
but you shouldn't be inferring

405
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,944
there's something wrong

406
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,944
with my Billy.

407
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,113
Darlin', there's no inferring.

408
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,031
I've seen the boy

409
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,031
sitting in the dirt

410
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,784
eating his own

411
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,784
belly button lint.

412
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,039
♪ That's the way

413
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,039
the girls are in Texas ♪

414
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,292
(gasps)

415
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,710
Really, Mom? This is how

416
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,710
you put out the fire?

417
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,255
Well, at least she got

418
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,255
the worst of it.

419
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,631
How you figure that?

420
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,217
I ripped a big patch of hair

421
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,217
out of her head.

422
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,387
This will be healed in a week.

423
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,098
She will be wearing a hat

424
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,098
till Labor Day.

425
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,475
(chuckles)

426
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,393
I want to be just like you

427
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,393
when I grow up.

428
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,353
No, you don't.

429
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,353
Pick again.

430
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,240
Excuse me, Ms. Hutchins?

431
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,242
Hey, Sheldon.

432
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,578
Can you recommend any books

433
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,578
on overcoming phobias?

434
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,372
That's in the self-help section.

435
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,083
Follow me, I have read them all.

436
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,836
Any phobia

437
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,836
in particular?

438
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,836
Dogs.

439
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,879
Ah, cynophobia.

440
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,879
That's a good one.

441
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,799
Did you know there's

442
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,799
over 50 million dogs

443
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,092
just in the United States alone?

444
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,677
That's 50 million

445
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,677
too many.

446
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,348
Here. I read this one to help

447
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,348
with my haphephobia.

448
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:25,393
Ah, fear of being touched.

449
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:25,393
I have that, too. Was it useful?

450
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,896
Well, when someone's

451
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,896
interested in touching me,

452
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,524
we'll find out.

453
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,944
(sighs)

454
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,944
ADULT SHELDON:

455
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,944
<i>The basic premise</i>

456
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,737
<i>of the book was that phobias</i>

457
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,906
<i>were overcome by taking</i>

458
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,906
<i>incremental steps</i>

459
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,493
<i>toward confronting</i>

460
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,493
<i>the phobia in question.</i>

461
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,538
<i>In my case, that started</i>

462
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,538
<i>with watching a TV show</i>

463
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,165
<i>that was adored by children</i>

464
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,165
<i>around the world,</i>

465
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,544
<i>but for me,</i>

466
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,544
<i>was the stuff of nightmares.</i>

467
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,046
Scooby-Doo!

468
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,466
<i>The next step</i>

469
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,466
<i>was to go face-to-face</i>

470
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,093
<i>with real dogs.</i>

471
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,888
<i>Albeit through</i>

472
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,888
<i>a plate-glass window.</i>

473
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,014
Okay, that's enough.

474
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,474
ADULT SHELDON:

475
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,474
<i>And finally,</i>

476
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:07,227
<i>a close encounter</i>

477
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:07,227
<i>of the third kind,</i>

478
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,770
<i>physical contact with a member</i>

479
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,770
<i>of the canine species.</i>

480
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:14,401
Hello, I'd like to speak

481
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:14,401
with the veterinarian.

482
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,735
Well, I was hoping

483
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,735
you might have one or two dogs

484
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,906
under anesthesia that

485
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,906
I might come by and pet.

486
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,491
Sure, I'll hold.

487
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,535
Who are you talking to?

488
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,662
The Medford Veterinary Clinic.

489
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,288
Why?

490
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,040
I'm trying to overcome

491
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,040
my fear of dogs

492
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,418
before it affects

493
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,418
our family any further.

494
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,003
Oh, honey, you don't have to

495
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,003
worry about how it affects us.

496
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,755
Meemaw got punched

497
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,755
in the face because of me.

498
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:40,885
No, that wasn't because of you,

499
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:40,885
and for the record,

500
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,012
your meemaw gets punched

501
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,012
in the face all the time.

502
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,805
Well, I still think

503
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,805
I need to take

504
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,433
some sort of positive action.

505
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,975
WOMAN (on phone): Hello?

506
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,975
Yes, hello?

507
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,644
Oh, that's too bad.

508
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:53,523
How about a small fluffy one

509
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:53,523
that's recently died of old age?

510
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,191
Enough.

511
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,860
Sorry. (sighs)

512
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,619
Now, it says here

513
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,619
in Mark 12:31

514
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,869
that you should

515
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,869
"Love your neighbor

516
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,955
as yourself."

517
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,916
Anybody like to take a guess

518
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,916
what that means? Missy?

519
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,961
It means to be nice to

520
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,961
the people who live next door.

521
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,170
That's right.

522
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,465
But everybody else

523
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,465
can go to hell.

524
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,842
Okay, Missy, we don't use

525
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,842
that kind of language here.

526
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,595
And if you think about it,

527
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,595
in this world,

528
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:27,265
with all the ways we can travel,

529
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:27,265
everybody's your neighbor.

530
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,767
Yes, Sheldon.

531
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,310
How do we love

532
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,310
our neighbors

533
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,228
when our moms hate each other?

534
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,439
Who does your mom hate?

535
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,439
Your mom.

536
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,734
Hey, my mom hates your mom.

537
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,734
Small world.

538
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,026
Okay, let's hang on a second.

539
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,737
My mom also hates

540
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,737
their grandma.

541
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,196
'Cause she lost a fight to her.

542
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,241
Nuh-uh, she won. She said so.

543
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,951
All right, stop. Let's stop.

544
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,287
Now this might be hard

545
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,287
to understand,

546
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,331
but living a loving,

547
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,331
Christian life

548
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,041
isn't always

549
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,041
the easiest thing to do.

550
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,336
Yes, Billy.

551
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,130
My mom's not crazy

552
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,130
about you either.

553
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,636
Just love your neighbor, 'kay?

554
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,636
(sniffs)

555
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,305
JEFF: Now, I am more than

556
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,305
willing to look the other way

557
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,307
when my parishioners don't

558
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,307
get along with each other.

559
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,976
That sort of thing happens,

560
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,976
but when it becomes a problem

561
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,562
for the children,

562
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,562
then I have to intervene.

563
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,064
There's no

564
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,064
problem here,

565
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,400
other than these two thinking

566
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,400
that they're better than me.

567
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,735
I don't think it, I know it.

568
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,111
I gave your mother

569
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,111
a good smacking.

570
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,488
I can give you one, too.

571
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,782
That's big talk from somebody

572
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,782
with a comb-over.

573
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,283
JEFF:

574
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,283
Ladies.

575
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,202
Do I need to remind you

576
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,202
that we are Christians?

577
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,412
In all our behavior,

578
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,412
in all our actions,

579
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,957
we must constantly

580
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,957
ask ourselves the question,

581
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,835
"What would Jesus do?"

582
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,918
Can I say something?

583
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,379
Would Jesus say it?

584
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,422
Never mind.

585
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,843
ADULT SHELDON:

586
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,843
<i>In my life, I've often</i>

587
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,429
<i>been accused of being</i>

588
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,429
<i>a physical coward,</i>

589
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:51,932
<i>and for the most part,</i>

590
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:51,932
<i>those accusations are correct.</i>

591
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:57,564
<i>But there have been times</i>

592
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:57,564
<i>when I've shown great courage.</i>

593
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,650
<i>This was one of them.</i>

594
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,319
Hello, Bucky.

595
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:07,741
Are you a good dog?

596
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,368
(sighs)

597
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,995
Please be a good dog.

598
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,248
(sighs) Please.

599
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,042
Now oftentimes,

600
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,042
when we don't like someone,

601
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,461
what's happening is

602
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,461
we see something in them

603
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,088
that we don't like in ourselves.

604
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,548
What are you saying?

605
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,675
Really? That was

606
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,675
over your head?

607
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,010
(scoffs)

608
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,010
I'm saying,

609
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,304
y'all might have more in common

610
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,304
than you think.

611
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,724
Well, don't say

612
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,724
both their kids are "special."

613
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,435
She does not

614
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,435
like that.

615
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,813
SHELDON:

616
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,813
<i>Okay.</i>

617
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,566
Here we go.

618
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:45,945
Petting... the dog.

619
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,922
I'm doing it.

620
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,591
I'm petting a dog.

621
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,594
I've conquered my phobia.

622
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:13,222
You're a good boy.

623
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:13,222
Yes, you are.

624
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,391
(sighs)

625
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,311
I'm sorry for the unkind things

626
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,311
I said to you.

627
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,022
Me, too.

628
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,233
Connie?

629
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,985
What?

630
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,154
Anything you'd like to say?

631
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,865
Not particularly.

632
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,617
Mom.

633
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,076
Okay.

634
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,914
I'm sorry for the things I said,

635
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:41,876
and, you know, what happened

636
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:41,876
at the bowling alley.

637
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,463
As am I.

638
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,132
Here.

639
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,343
I think this came out

640
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,343
of your head.

641
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,599
He licked me! He licked me!

642
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,309
The dog licked

643
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,309
my tongue!

644
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,186
I can still taste it!

645
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:03,439
Call 911!

646
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:03,439
(door slams)

647
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,776
I think Jesus

648
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,776
might go check that out.

649
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,113
<i>(Sheldon gargling)</i>

650
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,073
How's it going in there, baby?

651
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,828
SHELDON: (spits) Okay, but we're

652
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,828
gonna need more Listerine.

653
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,914
(gargling)

654
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,083
I'm proud of him for trying to

655
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,083
overcome that damn dog phobia.

656
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,627
You should tell him that.

657
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,505
Well, if he ever leaves

658
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,505
that bathroom, I will.

659
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,967
What I can't figure out is why

660
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,967
that dog is so drawn to Sheldon.

661
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,426
Beats me.

662
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,846
You say his owner's

663
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,846
in the slammer?

664
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,846
Yeah.

665
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,264
Wonder what kind of fella he is.

666
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,893
(rock music plays)

667
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,828
(sniffing)

668
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,538
(whines)

669
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,290
It's a mystery.

670
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,252
I guess we'll

671
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,252
never know.

672
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,507
MEEMAW:

673
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,507
Hey, Moonpie.

674
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,385
I got you a little something

675
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,385
to help you

676
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,512
get over your fear of animals.

677
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,431
A tranquilizer gun?

678
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,100
A pet fish.

679
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,564
Why?

680
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,274
Well, I thought you could

681
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,274
start small

682
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,525
and then work your way up.

683
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,946
Look, he's

684
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,946
kind of cute.

685
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:37,658
He doesn't even care

686
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:37,658
that I'm here. I like him.

687
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,702
What are you

688
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,702
gonna name him?

689
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,328
Fish.

690
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,580
Fish?

691
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,041
I'm not ready to get attached.

692
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,002
Fish are kind of boring.

693
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,212
I know, isn't it great?

694
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,631
But you can't

695
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,631
even pet 'em.

696
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,884
Maybe we can.

697
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,218
(screaming)

698
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,511
Baby, what's wrong?

699
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,223
I tried to pet Fish!

700
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,223
Ah, he was so slimy!

701
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,434
Well, yeah, he's a fish.

702
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,980
I put my finger in the top

703
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,980
of the tank, then I touched him,

704
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,188
and he bit me!

705
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,941
Oh, I'm sure he didn't bite you.

706
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,317
SHELDON:

707
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,317
I can't breathe.

708
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,862
His fish blood is mixing

709
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,862
with my human blood.

710
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,573
Maybe he was just trying

711
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,573
to give you a kiss.

712
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,573
No.

713
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:20,242
He hates me. I never

714
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:20,242
want to see him again.

715
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,577
Oh, Sheldon,

716
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,577
you're being silly.

717
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,537
Fish like this don't bite.

718
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,958
Look. See?

719
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,958
He's harmless.

720
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,960
Son of a bitch!

721
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,461
Dad killed my fish!

George!

723
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,547
He'll be fine.

724
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,758
Just got to put him

725
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,758
back in the bowl.

726
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,680
Oh, George.

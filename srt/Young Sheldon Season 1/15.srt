1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,171
What are you doing?

2
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:05,840
I heard you could

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:05,840
punch a hole in these

4
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:07,633
and make them double-sided.

5
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:09,259
Then it would have more storage?

6
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:12,262
Yes, but I didn't pay

7
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:12,262
for a double-sided floppy disk.

8
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:13,973
So?

9
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,850
So it's an ethical dilemma.

10
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,101
We have to take a shower

11
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,101
in the locker room next period,

12
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,895
and that's what

13
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,895
you're worried about?

14
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:23,231
Actually, I have

15
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:23,231
a bathing suit under my pants.

16
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:27,569
Whoa.

17
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,656
That girl just took

18
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,656
a book on geostatistics.

19
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,198
Yeah, so?

20
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,368
That's not required reading

21
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,368
for any science course.

22
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,912
Maybe she wants

23
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,912
to squash a spider with it.

24
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:39,331
No, look, she's reading it.

25
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,959
Who is this mystery woman?

26
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,252
Should we invite her

27
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,252
to have lunch with us?

28
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,129
I don't know. So far,

29
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,129
it's just been you and me,

30
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,589
and we know that works.

31
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,717
Do we really want

32
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,717
to mess with success?

33
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,051
We could think of it

34
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,051
as an experiment.

35
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:55,764
Oh, you do know

36
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:55,764
how to push my buttons.

37
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,098
All right, go ask her.

38
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,726
Why me?

39
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,687
Your lack of testosterone makes

40
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,687
you adorable to women.

41
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:06,025
I can't argue with that.

42
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,945
Hello.

43
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,780
Hello.

44
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:12,990
My name is Sheldon.

45
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:14,867
Yeah, you're Sheldon Cooper.

46
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,618
You know who I am?

47
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,370
Well, there's only one

48
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,370
nine-year-old in high school,

49
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:19,914
and you still have

50
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:19,914
your baby teeth.

51
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:23,124
She knows who I am.

52
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:23,124
It's going well.

53
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:26,503
What do you want?

54
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:29,631
Would you like to have lunch

55
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:29,631
with me and my friend?

56
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,258
Why?

57
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,551
Why else?

58
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,135
So we can have

59
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,135
a spirited conversation

60
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,721
about geostatistics.

61
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:38,432
You really are

62
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:38,432
as smart as everybody says.

63
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:42,436
My teeth are small, but my

64
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:42,436
prefrontal cortex is enormous.

65
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,812

80

You're gonna be a geologist.

81
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,760
That's fascinating.

82
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,219
Why'd you choose that?

83
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,930
When I was a little girl,

84
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,930
my grandparents took me

85
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:20,181
to Carlsbad Caverns,

86
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:20,181
and I was hooked.

87
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,810
Exploring caves,

88
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,810
that is super cool.

89
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,354
Disagree. Dark,

90
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,354
enclosed spaces are terrifying.

91
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,108
I get scared putting on

92
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,108
a sweatshirt.

93
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,943
Hmm.

94
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,943
I've seen it.

95
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,694
Pretty entertaining.

96
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,822
Do you know what you're going

97
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,822
to major in in college?

98
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,199
I'm leaning towards quantum

99
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,199
chromodynamics, but who knows?

100
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,202
A few years ago, I would've

101
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,202
said choo-choo trains.

102
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,621
What about you?

103
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,957
Oh, geology for sure.

104
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,957
Hmm.

105
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,416
Really?

106
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,626
When did you decide that?

107
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,962
A long time ago.

108
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,962
Eat your apple slices.

109
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,759
So we eat in the

110
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,759
library every day.

111
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,302
You're welcome to join us.

112
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,929
It's much better

113
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,929
than the cafeteria.

114
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:02,724
It's quiet, and a lot less food

115
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:02,724
gets thrown at us.

116
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,226
Yeah. Maybe

117
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,226
I'll see y'all tomorrow.

118
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,104
Right.

119
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,272
Maybe y'all will.

120
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,109
Bye, Libby.

121
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:13,568
"Y'all"?

122
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,112
I'm assimilating.

123
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:17,072
Shut up.

124
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,198
(Sheldon sighs)

125
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,495
(insects trilling)

126
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,747
So how was school today?

127
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,082
Sheldon's got a girlfriend.

128
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,043
What?

129
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,043
SHELDON:

130
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,043
That's not true.

131
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,670
Oh, yes, it is. I seen him

132
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,670
talking to her at school.

133
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,089
Sheldon Lee Cooper, you dog.

134
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,382
Is she cute?

135
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,092
Compared to what?

136
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,553
What grade is she in?

137
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,804
Eleventh.

138
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,890
An older woman. Nice.

139
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,142
Most everybody's older than me.

140
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,560
Why is that nice?

141
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,478
(chuckles)

142
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,478
So what do you think, George?

143
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,190
Is it time to have

144
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,190
"the talk" with him?

145
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,482
What talk?

146
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,275
No talk. Nobody's talking.

147
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,029
If "the talk" is in regards

148
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,029
to human reproduction,

149
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,364
I already understand

150
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,364
how that works.

151
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,824
How do you know that?

152
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,242
I told him.

153
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,618
(Meemaw chuckles)

154
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,620
Oh, Lord.

155
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,123

Are you saying

162
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,132
that without geology,

163
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,719
there'd be

164
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,719
no theory of evolution?

165
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,512
Charles Lyell taught

166
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,512
Charles Darwin

167
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,556
the Earth was much, much older

168
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,556
than anyone thought,

169
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,767
which gave Darwin the courage

170
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,767
to figure out

171
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,103
all species evolved

172
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,103
over billions of years.

173
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,812
That's good.

174
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,812
I can use that

175
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:34,233
to humiliate my pastor

176
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:34,233
at Sunday school.

177
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,026
I don't know

178
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,026
what's more beautiful,

179
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:37,778
your mind or your eyes.

180
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,987
Tam, please.

181
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,655
We're eating.

182
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,752
You know spying

183
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,752
on kids is creepy.

184
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,546
I wasn't spying on kids,

185
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,546
I was s-spying on your brother.

186
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,632
Why won't you just go inside?

187
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,509
Well, then, it wouldn't

188
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,509
be spying, now would it?

189
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,096
Oh.

190
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,639
Oh, what?

191
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,474
You didn't mention

192
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,474
she was black.

193
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,350
Was I supposed to?

194
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,145
No, 'course not.

195
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,105
Then why bring it up?

196
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,607
It just wasn't

197
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,607
what I was expecting.

198
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,900
What were you expecting?

199
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,193
It's a big school.

200
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,028
Why are you right here?

201
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,489
They've got some books in there

202
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,489
about Martin Luther King.

203
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,741
Maybe you should go read one.

204
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,910
(school bell ringing)

205
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,665
Morning.

206
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,542
So why did it take

207
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,542
people so long

208
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,544
to believe in continental drift,

209
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,839
when it's obvious

210
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,839
that Africa and South America

211
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,591
-fit together like a puzzle?

212
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,591
-No, they don't.

213
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,218
People didn't understand

214
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,218
continental drift

215
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,887
because they didn't understand

216
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,887
seafloor spreading.

217
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,182
What?

218
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,432
I'm both threatened

219
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,768
and delighted by your brain.

220
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,728
I'm just delighted by it.

221
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,273
They do fit.

222
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:58,399
That's nuts.

223
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,407
"Geologists lead

224
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,407
a sedimentary lifestyle."

225
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,576
Libby, that is a good one.

226
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,955
Can you believe

227
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,955
what's going on with him?

228
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,915
(laughing):

229
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,915
I know.

230
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,583
He's been on the phone with

231
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,583
that girl for almost an hour.

232
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,376
Sheldon's got

233
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,376
a girlfriend.

234
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,586
What are the odds?

235
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,379
She's not a girlfriend,

236
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,050
it's more of a mental rapport.

237
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,302
That's where it starts.

238
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:27,637
I did win you over

239
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:27,637
with my superior intellect.

240
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,597
It was your motorcycle

241
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,597
and you know it.

242
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,975
Good thing it wasn't

243
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,975
your masculine physique,

244
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,643
because that is long gone.

245
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:34,978
(chuckling)

246
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,564
Why do you think

247
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,564
I kept the motorcycle?

248
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,234
How come he gets to tie up

249
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,234
the phone and I can't?

250
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,819
Because what is happening

251
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,819
in there is called a miracle,

252
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,280
and God-fearing people do not

253
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,280
get in the way of those.

254
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,781
GEORGE SR.:

255
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,781
Hey, Georgie,

256
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,367
if you ever find a girlfriend,

257
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,077
maybe you can go on a double

258
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,077
date with your brother.

259
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,120
She's not his girlfriend.

260
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,705
And I can find one...

261
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,040
I'm just not looking.

314
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,457
Well, I think I figured out

315
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,457
the problem.

316
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,749

What's up?

320
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,962
Well,

321
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,047
Sheldon's been spending

322
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,047
quite a bit of time

323
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,674
with this Libby girl, lately.

324
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:28,842
Yeah, so?

325
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,469
So isn't he a little young

326
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,970
to be hanging with teenagers?

327
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,014
Oh, he's only young

328
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,014
on the outside.

329
00:08:34,054 --> 00:08:35,849
Inside, he's an old man.

330
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,100
I'm being serious.

331
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,852
So am I.

332
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,395
And with that bowtie,

333
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,395
he's old on the outside, too.

334
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,358
Sorry I bothered.

335
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,818
Hang on.

336
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,529
What did you think

337
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,529
was gonna happen

338
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,822
when we sent him to high school?

339
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,283
I don't know,

340
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,283
that he'd learn stuff,

341
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:57,287
and then, come back home

342
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:57,287
and be my baby forever.

343
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:58,872
Mare, it's good for him.

344
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,416
He may start college in a couple

345
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,416
years, what happens then?

346
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,379
Off the top of my head,

347
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,379
he and I share a dorm room.

348
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,883
You know I'd laugh at that

349
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,883
if I didn't kind of believe you.

350
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,227
What are you doing?

351
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:24,272
I need to use the bathroom, but

352
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:24,272
it can get uncivilized in there.

353
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,732
Anyone in there now?

354
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,776
I don't know.

355
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,776
I was afraid to find out.

356
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,363
Anybody in here?

357
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,614
Go ahead.

358
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,741
I'll stand guard.

Where have you been all my life?

360
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,752
I don't think so.

361
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,337

367
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,058
you'd be available

368
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,018

369
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,770
You have a bathroom schedule?

370
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,272
You don't?

00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,464
and it's on<i> Star Trek,</i>

388
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,464
where it belongs.

389
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:31,881
LIBBY: You know they're playing

390
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:31,881
a space shuttle movie

391
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,508
at the Museum of

392
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,508
Natural Science.

393
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,635
It's in IMAX.

394
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,635
I heard about that.

395
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,263
The screen is supposed

396
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,263
to be huge.

397
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,263
They also have

398
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,639
a great geology exhibit.

399
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,516
Well, it's in Houston--

400
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,643
how are we gonna get there?

401
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,643
I'll drive.

402
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,728
Oh, I would love to

403
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,728
see a movie with you.

404
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,564
Don't you need to ask

405
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,564
your parents first?

406
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:50,358
No, Sheldon, I don't.

407
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:50,358
But won't they worry

408
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:50,358
where you are?

409
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,651
They'll be fine.

410
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,278
Count me in.

411
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,364
Glad you're not<i> my</i> son.

412
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,451
(slurping)

413
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,662
And now he wants to see a

414
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,662
movie in Houston with them.

415
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,289
Why Houston?

416
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,791
I don't know,

417
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,791
it's in MixMax or something.

418
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,502
So you're saying I got

419
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,502
to drive to Houston?

420
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,504
No. This girl Libby's

421
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,504
gonna drive.

422
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,130

423
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,548
It's not great, George.

424
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,674
I don't want my little boy

425
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,674
in some car

426
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,135
with a teenager

427
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,135
behind the wheel.

428
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,220
All high school kids drive.

429
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,222
Yeah? Well, I

430
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,222
don't like it.

431
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,516
Would you let<i> me</i>

432
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,516
get in a car

433
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,434
with a stranger

434
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,434
when I was young?

435
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,894
Well, nobody ever asked you out,

436
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,894
so it didn't really matter.

437
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,229
(chuckles)

438
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,691
(train whistle blows)

439
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,656
Hey. I want to talk to you.

440
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:40,367
Hold on. Let me bring

441
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:40,367
this into the station

442
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,119
so as not to disappoint

443
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,119
my commuters.

444
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,622
They'd like to get home

445
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,622
to their families.

446
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,416
(train whistle blows)

447
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,836
I gave it a lot of thought,

448
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,836
and I'm afraid I can't allow you

449
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,421
to drive to Houston

450
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,421

451
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,964

452
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,299
Well, honey, you're

453
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,299

454
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,009
I don't think it's right.

455
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,761
I'm not a little boy.

456
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,761
I'm a high school student.

457
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,597
I'm sorry, I made up my mind.

459
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,641
to see this movie,

460
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:05,892

579
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,122
<i>kids for years.</i>

580
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,458
Excuse me.

581
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,586
I don't feel well.

582
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,045
They'll have to go without me.

583
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,256
(Sheldon panting)

584
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,759
♪ ♪

585
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,636
(crying quietly)

586
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,513
MARY:

587
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,513
Shelly,

588
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:31,598
you okay?

589
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,350
No.

590
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,976
You want to talk about it?

591
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,854
No.

592
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,231
You want me to leave you alone?

593
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,483
No.

594
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,948
I thought Libby and I

595
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,948
were equals,

596
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,909
but she thinks of me as a child.

597
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,911
I'm sorry, baby.

598
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,705
Calling me that

599
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,705
isn't helping right now.

600
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,457
Right. Sorry.

601
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,918
She is almost twice your age.

602
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,044
There are people

603
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,044
<i>five</i> times my age

604
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,922
that are stupider than me.

605
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,757
This is not about being smart.

606
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,008
What else<i> is</i> there?

607
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,008
Well...

608
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,428
there's other kinds of maturity.

609
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,805
What's up?

610
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,765
None of your business.

611
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,266
Why is he crying?

612
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,684
Again, it's none

613
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,684
of your business.

614
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,144
Please go.

615
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:22,315
Fine. Celeste and I know

616
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:22,315
when we aren't wanted.

617
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,192
Where were we?

618
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,945
Different kinds of maturity.

619
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,571
That's right.

620
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,030
(sighs)

621
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,117
There's emotional maturity,

622
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,117
physical maturity,

623
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,620
all things that have nothing

624
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,620
to do with being smart.

625
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,539
Are you suggesting

626
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,539
I'm not emotionally mature?

627
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,083
I was hinting at it.

628
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,545
Regardless, I'm not interested

629
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,545
in making any more friends.

630
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,340
Oh, I don't think

631
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,340
that's how you really feel.

632
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,842
It is.

633
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,886
From now on,

634
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,886
it's a hermit's life for me.

635
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,722
I bet, when you grow up,

636
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,722
you will be surrounded

637
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:59,686
by lots of smart,

638
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:59,686
wonderful friends.

639
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,938
I can't see that happening.

640
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,189
Well,

641
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,692
the Lord works

642
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,692
in mysterious ways.

643
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:09,028
And here we go

644
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:09,028
with the God talk.

645
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,864
(exhales)

646
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:15,993
Hey.

647
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,161
Hey.

648
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,454
How was the IMAX movie?

649
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,624
Well...

650
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,251
MAN:

651
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,251
Okay, status. Find them?

652
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:26,462
Go.

653
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:26,462
Guidance...

654
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,508
What are you doing?

655
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,386
(whispers): What do

656
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,386
you think I'm doing?

657
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,096
Move your arm

658
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,096
before I rip it off.

659
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,726
It got a little uncomfortable.

660
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,352
Why is that?

661
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,354
Libby's got feelings for me,

662
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,606
but I think it's better

663
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,606
we just stay friends.

664
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,735
(sighs) I've been giving

665
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,735
geology some more thought.

666
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,361
Yeah, and?

667
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,697
I've decided

668
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,697
it's not really a science.

669
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,616
It's not?

670
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,616
No, it's more like a hobby.

671
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:56,951
Rock collecting.

672
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,661
Childish, really.

673
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,038
I can see that.

674
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,998
ADULT SHELDON:

675
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,998
<i>As you can see,</i>

676
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,834
<i>sometimes a person can be</i>

677
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,834
<i>both incredibly intelligent</i>

678
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,211
<i>and full of baloney.</i>

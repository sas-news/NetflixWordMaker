CAPTAIN KIRK:

2
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:02,836
The<i> Enterprise</i> is preparing

3
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:05,965
to leave Beta III

4
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:05,965
in star system C-111.

5
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:09,426
Sociologist Lindstrom

6
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:09,426
is remaining behind

7
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:11,345
with a party of experts

8
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:11,345
who will help restore

9
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:14,556
the planet's culture

10
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:14,556
to a human form.

11
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,140
SPOCK:

12
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,140
The Late Landru, Captain.

13
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,977
A marvelous feat of engineering.

14
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,312
A computer capable

15
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,312
of directing the lives

16
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,897
of millions of human beings.

17
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,774
But only a machine, Mr. Spock.

18
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:25,985
The original Landru programmed

19
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:25,985
it with all his knowledge,

20
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,236
but he couldn't give it

21
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,236
his wisdom, his compassion,

22
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,531
his understanding, his soul.

23
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,367
I prefer the concrete,

24
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,367
the graspable, the provable.

25
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,745
You'd make a splendid computer,

26
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,745
Mr. Spock.

27
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,748
That is very kind of you,

28
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,748
Captain.

29
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,960
That's humorous, because Spock

30
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,960
is half human and half Vulcan.

31
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,587
But he's ashamed

32
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,587
of his human side.

33
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,131
That's why I

34
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,131
identify with him.

35
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,050
Good luck.

36
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,050
MEEMAW: I gravitate

37
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,050
a little more towards Kirk.

38
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,887
Why?

39
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,972
(imitating Shatner):

40
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,972
Be-cause... everything

41
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:56,598

42
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,560

43
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,560
so im-portant.

44
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,646
I should hope so--

45
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,646
he's the captain.

46
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:03,856
Sheldon.

47
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:05,024
Do me a favor.

48
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,525
Go help your brother study

49
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:07,776
for his math test tomorrow.

50
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,570
Is that really a

51
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,570
good use of my time?

52
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,196
Come on. I'm asking nice.

53
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,991
If he doesn't pass, he

54
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,991
won't be able to play football.

55
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:15,993
You realize

56
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:15,993
he's often mean to me.

57
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:19,580
So? Your mother's mean to me.

58
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:19,580
I still try to be helpful.

59
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,540
Does she break

60
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,540
wind on<i> your</i> head?

61
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,667
Because that's what

62
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,667
Georgie does to me.

63
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,378
Can you help me out here?

64
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,467
I'll do it if you take

65
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,467
me to the train store.

66
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,635
You got it.

67
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,599
And buy me

68
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,599
whatever I want.

69
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,808
Connie, what are you doing?

70
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,351
(imitating Shatner):

71
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,351
Just providing

72
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:45,272

73
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:45,272
with financial guidance.

74
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,148
(quietly):

75
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,148
Don't mock the captain.

76
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,651
If Georgie passes his test,

77
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,651
I'll get you whatever you want--

78
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,111
under 20 bucks.

79
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,281
Deal.

80
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,827
Why?

81
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:02,122
I guess I like him

82
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:02,122
better than you.

83
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,417
(knocking)

84
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,417
Georgie?

85
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,710
What?

86
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,710
Dad told me

87
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,753
to help you study

88
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,753
for the math test.

89
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,422
I don't need your help.

90
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,422
Get lost.

91
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,340
GEORGE SR.: Georgie,

92
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,340
let him help you!

93
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,508
Fine. Come in!

94
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,303
(rock music playing on stereo)

95
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,345
Oh, dear.

96
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,597
What's<i> your</i> problem?

97
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,766
No problem.

98
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,766
I'll just...

99

100
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,436
Help yourself.

101
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,229
Before we start, I'd

102
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,229
like to get a sense

103
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,649
of how much algebra

104
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,649

solving and graphing

108
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,737
linear inequalities?

109
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,737
Sure.

110
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,448
Great. Explain it to me.

Uh...

112
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,284
first you solve 'em...

113

and then you graph 'em.

this test'll count

198
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,042
for 25% of your final grade.

199
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,835
Be sure to show all your work.

200
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,378
If you get stuck on a question,

201
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,756
move on and come back to it

202
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,756
at the end.

203
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,340
And I shouldn't have

204
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,340
to say this,

205
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,843
but if there's any cheating,

206
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,843
I will see it.

207
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,179
I got eyes in the back

208
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,179
of my head.

209
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,806
I got more eyes than a potato.

210
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:06,932
(chuckles)

211
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,600
Ms. Ingram?

212
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,936
Yeah, Sheldon.

213
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,936
I'm done.

214
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,146
What?

215
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,438
I enjoyed it very much.

216
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,898
I'll take another

217
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,898
if you have one.

218
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,817
No, I don't have

219
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,817
another one.

220
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,194
J-Just read ahead

221
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,194
in the textbook.

222
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,321
Oh, boy.

223
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,451
ADULT SHELDON:

224
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,451
<i>Seeing my brother struggle</i>

225
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,078
<i>was difficult for me.</i>

226
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,539
<i>As his tutor,</i>

227
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,539
<i>I took his failure personally,</i>

228
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,667
<i>almost as if I had failed.</i>

229
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,838
<i>Which was odd,</i>

230
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,838
<i>because I knew how dumb he was.</i>

231
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,632
Georgie, how'd you do

232
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,632
on that math test today?

233
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,758
It was tough.

234
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,968
I don't know.

235
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,552
I'm sorry I wasn't more help.

236
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,762
Me, too.

237
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,681
That's all right, baby,

238
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,681
you tried.

239
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,225
Yeah. It's okay, baby.

240
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,603
I don't understand

241
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,603
what went wrong.

242
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,605
Is there any chance

243
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,605
you drank alcohol

244
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,482
when you were pregnant

245
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,482
with Georgie?

246
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,942
No!

247
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,359
Well, don't be

248
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,359
so high-and-mighty.

249
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,945
I drank when

250
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,945
I was pregnant with you.

251
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,280
You turned out fine.

252
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:04,823
These days everybody's like,

253
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,074
"Don't drink, don't smoke."

254
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,702
I swear. Texas is

255
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,702
turning into California.

256
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,164
You realize there's nothing

257
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,164
I can do if you fail.

258
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,123
You're off the team.

259
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,249
I know.

260
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,542
Well, I'm gonna ask Jesus

261
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,376
to help you get

262
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,376
a good grade on that test.

263
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:21,340
Shouldn't you have asked him

264
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:21,340
<i>before</i> he took it?

265
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,884
The man rose from the dead--

266
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,884
I think he can fix a test

267
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,260
after the fact.

268
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,179
You know, I hear you

269
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,179
say things like that,

270
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:30,224
and I wonder if maybe I did have

271
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:30,224
a few too many whiskey sours

272
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,558
when you were in my belly.

273
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,272
(sighs, clicks tongue)

274
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,859
Not me, but not bad.

275
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,239
I would say "A" for effort,

276
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,615
but... that's an "F."

277
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,288
What? How bad is it?

278
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,123
You got a "B."

279
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,126
Are you kidding?

280
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,836
I don't believe it.

281
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,297
Me, neither.

282
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,716
Me, neither.

283
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,093
(whistle blows)

284
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,595
So, I guess I have

285
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,595
to rethink my abilities.

286
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,098
Clearly, I'm

287
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,098
a wonderful teacher.

288
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,184
Georgie didn't pass

289
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,184
because of you.

290
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,685
What do you mean?

291
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,396
He cheated.

292
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,399
He had the answers written

293
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,399
on the bottom of his shoe.

294
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,234
He wouldn't do that.

295
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,736
When you cheat in school,

296
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,736
you only cheat yourself.

297
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,529
Where'd you get that?

298
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,366
An inspirational poster

299
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,366
outside the boys' room.

300
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,492
I saw what I saw, Sheldon.

301
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,745
Well, if this is true,

302
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,747
he needs to turn himself in.

303
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,375
That'll never happen.

304
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,375
He'll get kicked off the team.

305
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,127
I'm sorry, I can't

306
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,127
accept this.

307
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,254
There must be

308
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,254
another explanation.

309
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,423
If you don't believe me,

310
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,423
look at his shoes.

311
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,174
I will.

312
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,807
(grunting quietly)

313
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,061
(strained grunt)

314
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,521
This is quite a workout.

315
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,823
♪ ♪

316
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,057
♪ ♪

317
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,485
(whispers):

318
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,485
You dirty bird.

319
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,154
What are you doing in here?

320
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,489
You cheated.

321
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,366
No, I didn't.

322
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,911
I'm holding the evidence.

323
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,913
Let me see that.

324
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,707
(spits)

325
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,084
I don't see nothin'.

326
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,586
(gasps):

327
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,586
That's obstruction of justice,

328
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,339
as well as disgusting.

329
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,758
Oh, relax. By passing that test,

330
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,758
I get to play football,

331
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,053
and you get to go

332
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,053
to the train store.

333
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,679
Everybody wins.

334
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,056
But what about the truth?

335
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,682
What about it?

336
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,726
It's supposed to set us free.

337
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,395
Who told you that?

338
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,896
The Bible.

339
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,606
Since when do you care about

340
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,606
what's in the Bible?

341
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,942
When it helps me

342
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,942
win an argument.

343
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,071
The Bible also says honor

344
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,071
thy father and thy mother.

345
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,781
And if you open your mouth,

346
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,781
you're gonna make them sad.

347
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,658
ADULT SHELDON:

348
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,658
<i>He had me.</i>

349
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,828
<i>Somehow, the mullet-headed</i>

350
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,828
<i>simpleton had me.</i>

351
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,206
This isn't over.

352
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,166
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?

353
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,794
All right, maybe it's over.

354
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,093
SHELDON:

355
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,093
Meemaw?

356
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,893
I assume you've read the

357
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,893
Surgeon General's report

358
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,478
on the dangers of smoking?

359
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,189
I'm gonna wait

360
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,189
till they turn it into a movie.

361
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,899
Is that your new train?

362
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,903
Yes. It's my reward for helping

363
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,903
Georgie pass the math test.

364
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,114
You don't seem too happy

365
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,114
about it.

366
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,241
I don't feel like I earned it.

367
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,867
Why not?

368
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,453
Can you keep a secret?

369
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,581
Well, at my age, the question

370
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,581
is can I remember one.

371
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,873
Try me.

372
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,877
(whispers):

373
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,877
Georgie cheated on the test.

374
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,421
Oh.

375
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,089
And nothing bad happened.

376
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,466
He gets to stay

377
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,466
on the football team,

378
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,633
Mom and Dad are proud of him;

379
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,051
I even got a train for helping.

380
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,012
So you're feeling guilty.

381
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,432
Very much so.

382
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,017
Well, that's

383
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,017
a real conundrum.

384
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,061
Have you been reading the

385
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,061
Word of the Day calendar

386
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,729
I gave you for

387
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,729
your birthday?

388
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,524
Indubitably.

389
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,524
(chuckles)

390
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,445
So what do you think?

391
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,947
I don't think you should

392
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,947
let it bother you very much.

393
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,116
I mean, there's always gonna be

394
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,116
people in this world

395
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,328
who are playing fast and loose

396
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,328
with the rules.

397
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,204
And your brother's one of them.

398
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,834
That's how Captain Kirk is

399
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,834
on<i> Star Trek.</i>

400
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,670
Well, there you go, and he's,

401
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,670
like, the main guy on that show.

402
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,423
No, Mr. Spock is the main guy.

403
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:16,301
I stand corrected.

404
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:20,180
Although Kirk is usually the one

405
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:20,180
who saves the<i> Enterprise.</i>

406
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,642
Because he doesn't

407
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,642
always follow the rules?

408
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:27,395
He even cheated on a test

409
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:27,395
when he was a cadet.

410
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,105
The<i> Kobayashi Maru.</i>

411
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:29,939
The what?

412
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,024
<i>Kobayashi Maru.</i>

413
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,691
Kirk is a legend because of it.

414
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,903
(chuckles)

415
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,903
<i>Ko-Kobayashi Maru.</i>

416
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,448
Sounds like something

417
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,448
you eat at Benihana's.

418
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,074
Have you ever been

419
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,074
to one of those?

420
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,451
They make you sit

421
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,451
with strangers.

422
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,578
It's crazy.

423
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,666
Do you think a Spock

424
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,666
could become a Kirk?

425
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,959
Well, in my experience,

426
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,504
most people stay

427
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,504
the miserable bastards they are

428
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:53,754
their whole entire life.

429
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,048
But...

430
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,009
I have seen some folks change.

431
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,221
Hmm.

432
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,975
All right. Well, I'm gonna

433
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,975
go play with this train.

434
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,144
You do that.

435
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:23,660
(sighs)

436
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:24,743
(knocking on door)

437
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:25,786
SHELDON:

438
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:25,786
Georgie?

439
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,705
Go away.

440
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,122
I need to ask

441
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,122
a favor.

442
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,207
What?

443
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,167
It's private. Can I come in?

444
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,127
(sighs)

445
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,127
Come on.

446
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,924
Ugh.

447
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,342
What do you want?

448
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,928
It occurs to me

449
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,928
you have something in common

450
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,555
with Captain Kirk.

451
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,098
We both have cool hair?

452
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,516
In order to succeed,

453
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,685
you both play fast and loose

454
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,685
with the rules.

455
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,895
Yeah, I suppose we do.

456
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,814
When you cheated on the math

457
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,814
test, what was your strategy?

458
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,317
Well, I guess the most

459
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,317
important part

460
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,486
was not stepping on anything wet

461
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,486
before the test.

462
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,572
And not getting an "A."

463
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,532
Why wouldn't you want an "A"?

464
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:05,076
'Cause that would

465
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:05,076
raise suspicions.

466
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,869
Who would believe I got an "A"?

467
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,538
Wow.

468
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,081
Tell me more.

469
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,166
Okay, when you're telling a lie,

470
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,669
it's important to throw in

471
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,669
some details.

472
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,421
Like, when I was wanted to spend

473
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,421
the night at Ricky's house,

474
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,507
and Mom asked me if his mom

475
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,507
and dad were gonna be home,

476
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,508
I said, not only

477
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,260
are they be

478
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,260
gonna be home,

479
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,553
his dad was gonna teach us

480
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,680
how to cook turkey legs

481
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,680
in the smoker.

482
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,766
I like turkey legs.

483
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,766
Were they good?

484
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,892
There weren't any turkey legs,

485
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,892
you dope.

486
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,978
His parents were in Branson.

487
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:35,064
That's incredible.

488
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:35,064
I totally believed you.

489
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,608
Details.

490
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,527
Now get out of here,

491
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,527
I got to finish reading this.

492
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,615
Thank you, Georgie,

493
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,615
that was very helpful.

494
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:44,949
(man speaking on TV)

495
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,075
Did you hear that?

496
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,327
What?

497
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,620
Sounds like Georgie

498
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,620
and Sheldon

499
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:49,663
are getting along.

500
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:50,829
Really?

501
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,624
That can't be right.

502
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,916
I just heard it.

503
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,876
Maybe there's hope

504
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,876
for those two after all.

505
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,254
Or it's a sign of

506
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,254
the apocalypse.

507
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:01,215
Honey, I'm-I'm watching this.

508
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,343
(exhales)

509
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,138
So you'll have to

510
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,138
find someone else

511
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,223
to hold your ankles

512
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,223
in P.E. today.

513
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,767
I'm sorry, what?

514
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,101
I've suffered a terrible injury

515
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,687
and won't be able to attend.

516
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:14,813
What happened?

517
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,981
See for yourself.

518
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,778
"Dear Coach Wilkins,

519
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,778
please excuse my son, Sheldon,

520
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,822
"from P.E.

521
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,699
"He has experienced

522
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,699
a testicular hernia,

"and needs to rest for the next

six to eight weeks.

Sincerely, Mary Cooper."

526
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:33,914
Testicular hernia?

527
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,584
That's called details.

528
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,671
Ooh, that's rough.

529
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,005
Hmm.

530
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,048
How'd it happen?

531
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,800
It's hard to say,

532
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,969
but some risk factors include:

533
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,969
heavy lifting, a chronic cough

534
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,472
and repetitive straining

535
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,472
during bowel movements.

536
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,307
I've been there.

537
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,059
Hmm. All right.

538
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,479
Guess I'll see you in...

539
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,479
six to eight weeks.

out those books.

Hello.

567
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,107
What's that for?

568
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,903
Oh, this? I was just digging

569
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,903
for money in Meemaw's backyard.

570
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,696
There's money there?

571
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,323
Oh, yes. I already

572
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,323
found 75 cents.

573
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,117
Who do you think left it?

574
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,827
If I were to guess,

575
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,954
I'd say pirates

576
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,954
with holes in their pockets.

577
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,331
Can I use your shovel?

578
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,834
Be my guest.

00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,503
I'm gonna be rich.

581
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:08,509
Today, we're going to learn

582
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:08,509
about Sir Isaac Newton.

583
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,136
Hello, old friend.

584
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,846
...one of the world's

585
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,846
greatest scientists...

586
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,849
(school bell rings)

587
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,517
(grunts)

588
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,602
See you tomorrow, Wayne.

589
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,312
You have a good one, George.

590
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,105
Hey, how's your son doing?

591
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,189
Georgie?

592
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,276
No, the smart one.

593
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,945
He's fine. Why?

594
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,655
What about the hernia?

595
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,281
What hernia?

596
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,325
The one your wife said he had.

597
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,413
Happened to me

598
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,413
while I was in the Army.

599
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:41,375
I was in a bar in Georgia,

600
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:41,375
tried to lift up this big gal.

601
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,920
Swear I could hear something

602
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,920
pop down there.

603
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,463
Sheldon gave you this note?

604
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,631
Yeah.

605
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:47,966
I didn't write this.

606
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,133
You sure?

607
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,510
Looks like your

608
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,510
handwriting.

609
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,845
It's got that little

610
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,845
swoopy thing going on.

611
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,262
I didn't write it.

612
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,473
And I think I'd know

613
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,473
if my son had a hernia.

614
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,100
So what, Sheldon forged a

615
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,100
letter to get out of P.E.?

616
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,436
Looks like it.

617
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,104
How about that.

618
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,691
Don't be proud of him.

619
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,652
Can't help it. First time

620
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,652
he ever seemed like my kid.

621
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,112
Do you have any idea

622
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,656
what's gotten into him?

623
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:13,950
I might.

624
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,576
Well?

625
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,244
Have you ever heard of...

626
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,665
<i>Mobokachi Kaboom?</i>

627
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,125
Wait.

628
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,336
<i>Koshimaki Magoo.</i>

629
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,964
Wait a minute,

630
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,964
I'm gonna get this.

631
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,719
"Dear Professor Proton,

632
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,595
"I would very much

633
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,595
like to meet you,

634
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,139
"and I only have

635
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,139
three weeks to live.

636
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,976
"Please come visit me here

637
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,976
in Medford, Texas.

638
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,728
"Sincerely, Sheldon Cooper.

639
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,646
P.S. My Meemaw makes

640
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,646
excellent brisket."

641
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:44,939
MARY:

642
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:44,939
Sheldon.

643
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,775
Would you like

644
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,775
to explain this note?

645
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,069
Well?

646
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,153
I was trying to be

647
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,279
more like Georgie.

648
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,740
That's a dumb idea.

649
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,409
We don't want Georgie

650
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,409
to be like Georgie.

651
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,287
Well, let me start by saying

652
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,287
how very sorry I am.

653
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,378
ADULT SHELDON:

654

<i>Despite my explanation</i>

<i>my mother had me make amends</i>

658

<i>for all my misdeeds.</i>

659
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,510
<i>Starting in the library,</i>

660
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:18,097
<i>where I had to reshelve</i>

661
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:18,097
<i>hundreds of books.</i>

662
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,767
<i>Well, to be honest,</i>

663
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,767
<i>that one was a hoot.</i>

664
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:25,271
<i>The amends got worse when Coach</i>

665
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:25,271
<i>Wilkins made me climb the rope.</i>

666

<i>in a deli window.</i>

670

672

Which means...?

00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,281

00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,475
I was unhappy.

77
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,475
But that's lying.

78
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,937
You lied to your moon pie.

79
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,064
I bluffed my moon pie.

80
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,526

what's on a person's face

is not always

what's in their heart.

85
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,449
Well, this changes everything.

86
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,409
How do you know who to trust?

87
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,953
You don't.

88
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,622

on a beer run,

102
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,429

00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,389
you were saying?

153
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,933
You've confused possibilities

154
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,933
with probabilities.

155
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,852
According to your analogy,

156
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,852
when I go home

00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,813

So what do you think

164
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,945
the odds are

165
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,945
that God exists?

166
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,655
I think they're zero.

167
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,240
I believe in science.

168
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,658

PASTOR JEFF:

171
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,077
So you don't think

172
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,662
science and religion

173
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,662
can go hand in hand?

174
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,498
Science is facts,

175
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,498
religion is faith.

176
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,500
I prefer facts.

177
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,500
Mm.

178
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,086
I understand that.

179
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,754
Here's a cool fact for ya.

180
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,422
A lot of famous scientists

181
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,964
believed in God.

182
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,466
Isaac Newton.

183
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:19,843
Albert Einstein.

184
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,928
Even Charles Darwin.

(congregation ah'ing)

186
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,059
So Darwin's right about God

187
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,059
and wrong about evolution?

188
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,643
Now you're gettin' it.

189
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,353

00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,866
<i>the following Sunday</i>

198
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,866

199
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,659
(knocking)

200
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,335
Uh, hello, Mr. Cooper.

201
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,629
Is Missy home?

202
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,340
Hello, Billy.

203
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,340
No, she's at church.

204
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,010
I brought her eggs

205
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,010
from my chickens.

206
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,720
I see that.

207
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:07,057
You can boil them

208
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:07,057
or scramble them.

209
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,517
Okay.

210
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,771
I like fried.

211
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,315
Okay.

212
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:19,111
I don't like poached.

213
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,905
Okay.

214
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,492
Thank you for your time.

215
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,791
Okay.

216
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,836
MARY: You want me to cook

217
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,836
those eggs for you, baby?

218
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,671
No. They're a gift.

219
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,589
Sorry.

220
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,133
He even wrote me a note.

221
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:45,137
"Eggs from your

222
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:45,137
secret admirer. Billy."

223
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,014
GEORGE SR. (calls):

224
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,014
Mary, can you come in here?

225
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,473
I'm cookin'.

226
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,725
I really need you

227
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,725
to come in here.

228
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,727
What on earth?

229
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,314
Uh-oh.

230
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,564
What?

231
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,941
Listen to this.

232
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,985
"French philosopher,

233
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,821
"mathematician and physicist,

234
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,821
Blaise Pascal,

235
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:06,283
"argued a rational person

236
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:06,283
should believe God exists

237
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:09,161
"because you have everything

238
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:09,161
to gain if you're right,

239
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,538
and nothing to lose

240
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,538
if you're wrong."

241
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,748
Sounds right.

242
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,125
(footsteps approaching)

243
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,501
MARY:

244
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,501
Meemaw is coming over

245
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,545
to watch you-- I gotta go.

246
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,755
Where?

247
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,755
Daddy's not feeling good.

248
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,091
We're gonna go see a doctor.

249
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,052
Is he okay?

250
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,052
He's gonna be fine.

251
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,678
You just sit right there.

252
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,263
Meemaw's on her way over

253
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,263
to cook you dinner.

254
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,723
Can we come with you?

255
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,267
No. Just stay right there,

256
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,267
don't move.

257
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,311
George, let's go.

258
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,074
How long are we

259
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,074
supposed to sit here?

260
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,575
I don't know.

261
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,784
She said don't move.

262
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,496
She was very clear.

263
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,582
Hope I don't have

264
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,582
to go to the bathroom.

265
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,209
(door opens)

266
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,169
Don't worry!

267
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,879
Meemaw's here!

268
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,257
Everything's under control!

269
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,883
Oh.

270
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,883
(chuckles)

271
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,760
We haven't had dinner yet.

272
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,886
Really?

273
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,055
(groans)

274
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,557
I don't feel like cookin'.

275
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,772
I think my husband's having

276
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,772
a heart attack!

277
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,067
NURSE: I need an RRT

278
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,067
and a crash cart.

279
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,444
Over here.

280
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,988
Sir, are you having

281
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,988
chest pains right now?

282
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,240
Yeah, a little bit.

283
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,575
Any numbness

284
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,575
or pain in your arms?

285
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,993
Maybe this one.

286
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,287
Shortness of breath?

287
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,704
Enough questions.

288
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,123
He's a fat, middle-aged man

289
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,123
with chest pains.

290
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,540
Do something!

291
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,667
All right.

292
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,667
Sorry about the fat, honey.

293
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,753
You said you liked me this way.

294
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,630
(grunts)

295
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,465
Is Daddy gonna be okay?

296
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,508
Oh, yeah.

297
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,508
Your Pop-Pop used to have

298
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,677
little chest pains all the time.

299
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,721
Didn't he die of a heart attack?

300
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,515
Well,

301
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,515
for insurance purposes, yes.

302
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,977
(door opens)

303
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,104
Hey. What's goin' on?

304
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,981
Dad's in

305
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,981
the hospital.

306
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,108
What? Why's Dad in the hospital?

307
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,651
He's gonna be fine.

308
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,651
He had chest pains.

309
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,569
He's gonna be fine.

310
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,405
What are we doin'? Why

311
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,405
aren't we going to the hospital?

312
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,948
Nobody's goin' nowhere.

313
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,532
We're just

314
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,532
gonna stay calm,

315
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,035
have a nice dinner,

316
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,035
and wait for your mama to call

317
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,495
and tell us what's what.

318
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,914
I'm not hungry.

319
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,044
What did you mean

320
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,044
by "insurance purposes"?

321
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,130
Just eat.

322
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,300
(laughter on TV)

323
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,515
What kind of Texan drinks

324
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,515
pink wine?

325
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,642
(phone rings)

326
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,313
Hello.

327
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,731
Hi, Mom. Kids okay?

328
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,733
Yeah, they're fine.

329
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,733
How's George?

330
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,445
I don't know.

331
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,445
They're running tests.

332
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,906
Well, don't you worry about us.

333
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,906
(chuckles)

334
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,868
Everything's under control here.

335
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,411
Okay.

336
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,788
I'll call you when I know more.

337
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,748
How you holdin' up?

338
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,792
I guess I'm okay.

339
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,212
Well, George is gonna pull

340
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,212
through this, honey.

341
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,422
I guarantee it.

342
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,257
Thanks, Mom.

343
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,092
Thanks for bein' there.

344
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,719
You bet.

345
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,388
I'll call you later.

346
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,722
Okay.

347
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,098
Bye.

348
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,435
What'd she say?

349
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,438
The doctors are doin' some

350
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,438
tests, but, dollars to donuts,

351
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,566
your daddy's just got

352
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,566
a bad case of gas.

353
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,902
Y'all two go

354
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,902
get ready for bed.

355
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,487
I don't want to stay

356
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,487
around here.

357
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,906
I want to go to the hospital

358
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,906
and see Dad.

359
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,991
Well, I want to go to Las Vegas

360
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,991
and see Willie Nelson,

361
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,035
but that ain't gonna happen

362
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,035
either.

363
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,953
This is stupid.

364
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,621
You know

365
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,621
what's stupid?

366
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,249
I got to drink pink wine!

367
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,208
(door slams)

368
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,751
Meemaw?

369
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:45,877
What?

370
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,712
Is Dad really okay?

371
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,131
Yes.

372
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:53,009
I hope you're

373
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:53,009
not bluffing.

374
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,770
You asleep?

375
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,939
No.

376
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,857
Me neither.

377
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,236
Every time the phone rings,

378
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,236
I get scared.

379
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,781
Me, too.

00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,950
(knocking)

381
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,411
I'm goin' to see Dad.

382
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,411
You guys want to come?

383
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,414
How? Meemaw said

384
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,414
we have to stay here.

385
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,541
You want to go or not?

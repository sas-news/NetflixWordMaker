Well, I am happy to report

10
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:24,232
that my potato salad

11
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:27,027
is once again the

12
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:27,027
hit of the potluck.

13
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,821
That's great, honey.

14
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,821
I feel bad

15
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:30,531
for Pam Staples.

16
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,867
No one's touching

17
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,867
her potato salad.

18
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,786
If you feel bad,

19
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,786
then why are you smiling?

20
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:38,539
'Cause sometimes your

21
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:38,539
mommy's a big ol' hypocrite.

22
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,915
(chuckles)

23
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,583
Howdy, Coopers!

24
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,583
How we doing today?

25
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,335
Pastor Jeff.

26
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,335
Thank you, Pastor Jeff.

27
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,044
Y'all remember

28
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,044
my wife Selena.

29
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,338
MEEMAW:

30
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,338
Hi, Selena.

31
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,338
Oh, yeah.

32
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,756
<i>¿Qué tal?</i>

33
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:48,966
You're married

34
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:48,966
to her?

35
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,926
Why, yes, I am.

36
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,679
(quietly): You can think it--

37
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,679
you don't need to say it.

38
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,305
How are you liking Medford,

39
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,305
Selena?

40
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:58,099
(bad Spanish accent):

41
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:58,099
<i>¿Cómo te gusta Medford?</i>

42
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,605
She likes it fine.

43
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:06,066
Oh.

44
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:09,069
(grunts) She needs to use

45
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:09,069
the little girls' room.

46
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,779
Mary, could I talk to you

47
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,779
for a second?

48
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,280
Sure.

49
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,575
Don't worry.

50
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,575
I'll bring her right back.

51
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,451
Wasn't worried, but okay.

52
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,370
Okay.

53
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,288
His Spanish is terrible.

54
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,082
That's not what

55
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,082
she said at all.

56
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,417
Oh.

57
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,627
I don't know if you've heard,

58
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,254
but our church secretary,

59
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,297
Elizabeth Sohinki,

60
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,297
is currently seeking treatment

61
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,633
for a little problem

62
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,633
with-- shall we say--

63
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,343
under-the-counter medications.

64
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,345
Oh. So that rumor's true.

65
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:36,555
Mm-hmm.

66
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:36,555
Well, she did

67
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,599
always seem extremely alert.

68
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,601
Alert, shaky, sweaty. Anyway,

69
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,978
we need someone to step in

70
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,978
and fill the position.

71
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,980
I was wondering

72
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,980
if you might consider it.

73
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,900
It's not just bookkeeping.

74
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:50,778
I'd be in charge of handling the

75
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:50,778
maintenance issues-- you know,

76
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,780
plumbing, electric,

77
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,780
what have you.

78
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,699
And I'd also head

79
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,699
the planning committee

80
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,409
for all the

81
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,409
social events,

82
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,953
which, of course,

83
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,953
includes the big three:

84
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,246
baptisms, weddings, funerals.

85
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,541
And here is the cherry on top.

86
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:08,377
The sign in front of the church

87
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:08,377
with all the clever sayings...

88
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,213
"Be an organ donor,

89
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,213
give your heart to Jesus"?

90
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,673
Exactly.

91
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,550
Guess whose job it would be

92
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,550
to write those.

93
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,052
Yours.

94
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:17,096
Already working on a couple.

95
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,513
Listen to this.

96
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,182
(excited chuckling)

97
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:26,187
"The best vitamin

98
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:26,187
for a Christian is B1."

99
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,607
What?

100
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,026
You know, be one.

101
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,527
Like be a Christian.

102
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,613
And also B1 the vitamin.

103
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,449
Well, now that you

104
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,449
explained it, it's funny.

105
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,076
Yeah. Might be a thinker.

106
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:41,787
But there's a lot more

107
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:41,787
where that came from.

108
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,748
What about the twins?

109
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,459
Well, I'll still get 'em off

110
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,459
to school every day.

111
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,128
And when they get home,

112
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,880
Mom can keep an eye on 'em

113
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,880
till I get back.

114
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,590
Think she'll go for it?

115
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,884
Are you kidding?

116
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,884
She loves 'em like crazy.

117
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,136
Fat chance.

118
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,887
Oh, come on.

119
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,932
<i>You</i> come on.

120
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,932
I'm in the prime of my life.

121
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:05,144
I got my water aerobics

122
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:05,144
and my salsa dancing

123
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,645
and my bowling league.

124
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,396
But you love your grandchildren.

125
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,025
I love ice cream, too,

126
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,025
but I don't want to eat it

127
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,234
from 3:00 to 6:00

128
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,234
five days a week.

129
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,070
Well, I'm very disappointed.

130
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,655
And I'm fine with that.

131
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,239
Why don't you just

132
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,239
get a babysitter?

133
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,617
Kinda defeats the purpose

134
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,617
of making extra money.

135
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,994
Oh, yeah, right.

136
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,453
All right, let's

137
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,453
think about it.

138
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,746
Georgie.

139
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,581
Football practice.

140
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,625
And I don't trust him

141
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,625
when<i> I'm</i> home.

142
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,625
Oh.

143
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,294
Okay, now, what are we

144
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,294
talking about here?

145
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,673
Sheldon is intelligent

146
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,673
and responsible,

147
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:38,259
and Missy...

148
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:38,259
is his sister.

149
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,137
I think they'll be

150
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,137
fine home alone

151
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,514
all by themselves for a couple

152
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,514
hours after school.

153
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,641
You think?

154
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,641
I do.

155
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,102
As a matter of fact, I actually

156
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,102
think it'll be great for them.

157
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,021
These kids today

158
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,021
are so coddled,

159
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,856
I honestly think

160
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,856
y'all are raising

161
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,358
a whole generation

162
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,358
of sissies.

163
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,319
Is that the way you speak

164
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,319
about your grandchildren?

165
00:03:56,361 --> 00:04:00,115
Yes.

166
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,243

173

Hi.

174
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,347
How'd it go

175
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,347
with your mom?

176
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,891
She's not interested

177
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,891
in watching 'em.

178
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,768
Doesn't want to give up

179
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,768
her afternoons.

180
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,604
Of course. Sorry.

181
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,399
You know what, it's okay.

182
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,859
The timing wasn't right.

183
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,945
Maybe when the kids are older.

184
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,115
Okay.

185
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,953
(sighs) I guess

186
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,953
I'll go get dinner started.

187
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,547
How about this?

188
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,008
Go ahead and take the job.

189
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,676
Yeah, if it turns out

190
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,220
Sheldon and Missy can't

191
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,220
look out for themselves

192
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,222
for a couple hours

193
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,222
after school,

194
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:08,183
then... well, we'll cross

195
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:08,183
that bridge when we come to it.

196
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,643
Are you sure about this?

197
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,394
Yeah. Actually,

198
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,394
probably good for 'em.

199
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,563
Teach 'em a little

200
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,563
responsibility.

201
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,941
That's exactly

202
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,941
what my mom said.

203
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,776
Really?

204
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,360
Well, I still like

205
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,360
the idea.

206
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,197
Mmm.

207
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,118
MARY:

208
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,118
<i>Thank you, God, for this food</i>

209
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,869
we're about to receive,

210
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,869
and for the nourishment

211
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,455
of our bodies, and bless

212
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,455
the hands that prepared it.

213
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,250
ALL:

214
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,250
Amen.

215
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,626
So, kids,

216
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,045
we have a little family

217
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,045
business to discuss.

218
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,630
You're pregnant?

219
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,630
No.

220
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,757
We're getting a puppy?

221
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,757
No.

222
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,759
I'm not sure I care.

223
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,637
Starting next Monday,

224
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,637
I'm gonna take

225
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,639
a full-time job

226
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,639
at the church.

227
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,684
Well, who's going

228
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,684
to take care of us?

229
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,978
Well, nothing will change in the

230
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,978
morning-- I'll make breakfast,

231
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,980
take you both to school.

232
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,980
Then, after school,

233
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,940
you'll come home,

234
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,940
do your homework,

235
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,566
watch TV,

236
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,566
play with your toys

237
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,777
till I come home around 6:00.

238
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,197
Well, why can't Meemaw

239
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,197
take care of us?

240
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,782
'Cause she's not the person

241
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,782
you think she is.

242
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,782
George...

243
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,784
You're really gonna leave

244
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,784
these two alone?

245
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:08,869
Yes.

246
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,663
That's a brave choice.

247
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,498
Look, this job is important

248
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,498
to your mother.

249
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,876
We expect you both to

250
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,876
step up and be responsible.

251
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,627
I can do that.

252
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,129
Missy?

253
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,506
I'm thinking about it.

254
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,176
Very brave.

255
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,186
Okay, let's go over it

256
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,186
one more time.

257
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:37,356
House key's under the

258
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:37,356
plastic owl by the front door.

259
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,317
There's after-school snacks

260
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,317
in the fridge.

261
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:43,195
One for each of you.

262
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:46,365
Emergency numbers are

263
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:46,365
right there by the phone.

264
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,407
First aid kit is

265
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,407
in the hall closet.

266
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,869
(sighs)

267
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,869
And you won't be needing it,

268
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:54,373
but under the kitchen sink

269
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:54,373
is a fire extinguisher.

270
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,291
Ooh, that looks fun.

271
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,711
For fires only, and don't be

272
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,711
starting one just to use it.

273
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,756
(whispering): It's like

274
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,756
she can read my mind.

275
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,091
SHELDON:

276
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,091
Don't worry, Mom.

277
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,675
We'll make you proud.

278
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,844
I know you will, baby.

279
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,096
All set for your first day?

280
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,680
I believe I am.

281
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,680
Mm.

282
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:11,973
Mwah.

283
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:11,973
Mwah.

284
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:12,933
Go get 'em.

285
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,185
Thanks for waking me up.

286
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,520
I woke you up

287
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,520
40 minutes ago.

288
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,023
Well, you didn't do

289
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,023
a very good job.

290
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,442
Bye, y'all.

291
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,112
(groans)

292
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,238
(door closes)

293
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,618
Okay, yeah. Yeah.

294
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,203
Okay, later.

295
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,416
Sorry to bother you, Peg,

296
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,416
is Pastor Jeff available?

297
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,419
Jeff! You available?!

298
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,544
JEFF:

299
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,544
On the phone.

300
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,671
He's on the phone.

301
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,008
(coughing)

302
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,762
(wheezes, coughs)

303
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:57,518
You know, my mother's had some

304
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:57,518
luck cutting back on the smoking

305
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,812
by chewing that nicotine gum.

306
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:02,316
Got some right here.

307
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,817
So you do.

308
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,817
(chuckles)

309
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,859
JEFF:

310
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,859
Come on in.

311
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,236
Go on, you heard him.

312
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,237
(coughing)

313
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,781
Thank you.

314
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,199
Hey, hey.

315
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,618
Hey, Mare.

316
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,245
Uh, you finding everything

317
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,245
you need?

318
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,788
Oh, you bet.

319
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,666
So, I've been going

320
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,666
over the books,

321
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,085
and I think we have

322
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,085
enough money in our budget

323
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,421
to purchase

324
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,421
a personal computer

325
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,381
to handle all

326
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,381
the church business.

327
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,591
Okay.

328
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,591
(chuckles)

329
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,385
Well, uh, why don't you

330
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,385
leave the paperwork here,

331
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,552
and I'll-I'll take

332
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,552
a look at it.

333
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,511
Of course.

334
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,722
That's for your perusal.

335
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,183
(chuckles)

336
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:39,936
Everything okay?

337
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,688
What?

338
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,563
Yeah. Right as rain.

339
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,649
All righty.

340
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,901
Hey, if you have a minute,

341
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,737
I would love to talk to you

342
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,737
about the sign out front.

343
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,948
Yeah, sure.

344
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,546
So far so good.

345
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,567
SHELDON:

346
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,567
Hello?

347
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,777
Anybody?

348
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,615
They weren't kidding.

349
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,832
Maybe I'll just have

350
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,832
one little peek.

351
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,212
How come you're not

352
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,212
eating your snack?

353
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:51,341
I prefer my snack to be a

354
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:51,341
reward for homework well done.

355
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,676
You're like an old person.

356
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,512
Thank you.

357
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:05,939
What's your homework?

358
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,148
Non-Euclidean geometry.

359
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,358
How about you?

360
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,902
"Symonyms."

361
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,779
You mean synonyms.

362
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,156
I'm pretty sure

363
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,156
she said "symonyms."

364
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,536
Did you see that?

365
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,580
Someone's out there.

366
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,916
Oh, no. They're

367
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,916
in the backyard.

368
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,418
What do we do?

369
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:29,963
Aah!

370
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,715
(all screaming)

371
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:46,187
Would one of you please

372
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:46,187
get me a towel?

373
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,487
Why were you sneaking

374
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,487
around out there?

375
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,071
Yeah, you scared us.

376
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,407
I was checking up on you two.

377
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,452
And in case you're wondering,

378
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,452
you scared me back.

379
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,162
Well, why didn't you knock?

380
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,790
Because you two are supposed

381
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,790
to be doing this on your own.

382
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,792
And you don't

383
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,792
think we can.

384
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:08,876
Of course I do.

385
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,504
I'm the one who told your mother

386
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,380
that you were fine by yourselves

387
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,380
in the first place.

388
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,715
Then why were you

389
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,715
checking up on us?

390
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,968
That's called being two-faced.

391
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,345
We'll be okay on our own.

392
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,305
Yeah, we need to prove

393
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,305
we can do this.

394
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,557
All right.

395
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,683
I respect that.

396
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:29,356
And I'm happy to keep this

397
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:29,356
little incident a secret.

398
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,107
Really? I'm

399
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,107
telling everyone.

400
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,151
It was hilarious.

401
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,279
I'm going bowling.

402
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,032
(door opens, closes)

403
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,826
When we first started dating,

404
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,826
everything was wonderful.

405
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,870
That's when

406
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,870
it<i> is</i> wonderful.

407
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,164
All the problems started

408
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,164
once we got married.

409
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,625
Well, marriage will do that

410
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,625
to a relationship.

411
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,460
I-I got Selena

412
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,460
a credit card

413
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,213
to make small purchases

414
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,213
for the house.

415
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,299
You know... (stammers)

416
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,299
...coffee maker, DustBuster.

417
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,884
You know what she did?

418
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,678
She went to that

419
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,678
Sharper Image store

420
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,304
and she bought a massage chair.

421
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,515
Oh, I sat in one of those

422
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,515
at the mall.

423
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:04,641
It was terrific.

424
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:05,975
It's $2,000.

425
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:09,396
Oh. Well, seeing as I know

426
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:09,396
how much you make,

427
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,647
you can't afford that.

428
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,191
I... uh-uh.

429
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,235
ADULT SHELDON:

430
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,235
<i>Of all the afflictions</i>

431
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,697
<i>that can befall a child,</i>

432
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,697
<i>one reigns supreme.</i>

433
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:21,824
<i>Beyond scraped knees</i>

434
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:21,824
<i>and paper cuts,</i>

435
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:26,329
<i>nothing strikes fear into the</i>

436
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:26,329
<i>hearts of kids around the world</i>

437
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,415
<i>like a splinter.</i>

438
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:32,960
(distorted):

439
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:32,960
No!

440
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,005
Tell me why you were pretending

441
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,005
to have amnesia.

442
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,716
I've got a splinter!

443
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,342
So?

444
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,510
So, it's an emergency!

445
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,595
Call Meemaw!

446
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,137
Oh, calm down.

447
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,265
We can take care of this.

448
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,265
No, we can't!

449
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,101
Sheldon, if we can't handle

450
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,101
a little splinter,

451
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,311
they're never gonna leave us

452
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,311
alone again.

453
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,313
You're right.

454
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,607
So, what do we do?

455
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,483
Let me see it.

456
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,614
Oh, boy.

457
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,614
That's a deep one.

458
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,074
Hey, it's throbbing

459
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,074
really bad.

460
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,992
Mom would take it out

461
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,992
with tweezers.

462
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,203
Well, where would

463
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,203
we find tweezers?

464
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,913
Let's see what we got.

465
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,039
Band-Aids...

466
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,041
cotton balls.

467
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,918
What's "gowz"?

468
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,170
It's gauze, and the fact

469
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,170
that you don't know that

470
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,005
is not filling

471
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,005
me with hope.

472
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,635
Where would Mom

473
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,635
keep the tweezers?

474
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,220
Sometimes she uses

475
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,220
a needle on splinters.

476
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,220
No.

477
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,805
No needles. Anything

478
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,805
but needles.

479
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,643
Wait, she has tweezers

480
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,643
in her makeup bag.

481
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,478
She plucks her eyebrows

482
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,478
with them.

483
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,105
And sometimes her mustache.

484
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,279
Anything?

485
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,489
Nope.

486
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,115
Wait.

487
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,866
Maybe they're

488
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,866
in her room.

489
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,202
We're not allowed to go

490
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,202
in Mom and Dad's room.

491
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,664
Want me to get the needle?

492
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,751
(whispering):

493
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,751
Let's make this quick.

494
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,461
Why are you whispering?

495
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,963
That's how people speak

496
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,963
when they're being naughty.

497
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,006
I wouldn't know.

498
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,882
I'm naughty all the time.

499
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,726
You're really not coming in?

500
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,061
No. But you're doing great.

501
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,192
(sighs)

502
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,068
What's wrong?

503
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,112
This really is naughty.

504
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,905
I told you.

505
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,953
I don't see anything.

506
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,622
There's just a Bible

507
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,622
and a flashlight.

508
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:33,873
(phone ringing)

509
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:33,873
(screams)

510
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,124
(screams)

511
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,459
What do I do?

512
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,837
Answer it but sound calm.

513
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,341
Hello.

514
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,467
Hey, it's Dad.

515
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:45,593
How you guys doing?

516
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:46,803
We're great.

517
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,095
Glad to hear it.

518
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,347
I'm watching TV,

519
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,307
and Sheldon's reading quietly.

520
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,600
(sighs)

521
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:53,976
I knew you could handle this.

522
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,520
I'm proud of you.

523
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,520
You know what?

524
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,313
I'm proud of us, too.

525
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,065
Uh... (chuckling):

526
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,065
Okay, baby doll,

527
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,358
I'll be home in a couple hours.

528
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,402
Stay out all night.

529
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,402
We got this.

530
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,987
Wha... Love you, too.

531
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,198
(chuckles softly)

532
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,825
That was intense.

533
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,786
I don't think I'm cut out

534
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,786
for this latchkey life.

535
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,413
(phone ringing)

536
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,413
(both scream)

537
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,164
You answer it this time.

538
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,500
I can't; I'm supposed to be

539
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,500
reading quietly.

540
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,959
Answer it, Sheldon.

541
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,713
Well, I'm not going in there.

542
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,006
Hello. Cooper residence.

543
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,550
Sheldon speaking.

544
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,885
Hey, Shelly.

545
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,094
Oh, hello, Mom.

546
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,804
How's your day going?

547
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:34,934
Shelly?

548
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:38,396
Shelly? Shelly? You there?

549
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,231
Yes, I'm here.

550
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,941
She wants to know

551
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,941
how my day's going.

552
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,192
Say it's going good.

553
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,318
I can't say that.

554
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,570
Why not?

555
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,863
It's bad grammar.

556
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,030
How are you supposed to say it?

557
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,365
"It's going well."

558
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,450
Oh, that's nice.

559
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,326
I've got to get back to work,

560
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:56,163
but I love you

561
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:56,163
and miss you very much.

562
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,874
Okay.

563
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,043
I handled that really<i> well.</i>

564
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,211
(dial tone)

565
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,046
(knocking on door)

566
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,214
Got a minute?

567
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,133
Sure, come on in.

568
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,385
I just wanted to apologize.

569
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,764
I-It was wrong of me to unload

570
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,764
my personal business on you.

571
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,641
Here it is,

572
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,641
your first day and all.

573
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,683
Oh, that's fine.

574
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,393
Always happy to lend an ear.

575
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,186
Great, 'cause I didn't

576
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,186
tell you everything.

577
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,898
Really?

578
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,898
'Cause you told me a lot.

579
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,691
This morning,

580
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,691
while Selena was in the shower,

581
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,068
I went through her purse

582
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,068
and I took the credit card.

583
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,987
Oh, my.

584
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,987
Now,

585
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,865
do you think that's stealing,

586
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,865
or is it doing the right thing?

587
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,701
You know, saving us

588
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,701
from bankruptcy and whatnot?

589
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:37,455
Wow. Um, yeah,

590
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:37,455
that's complicated.

591
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,583
Um... going through her purse--

592
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,583
probably wrong,

593
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,586
but on the other hand...

594
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,004
...well, there is no other hand.

595
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,840
You can't be

596
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,840
doing things like that

597
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,132
and have a healthy marriage.

598
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,509
Why don't you just talk to her?

599
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,427
Explain

600
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,427
your financial situation?

601
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,554
That...

602
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,475
Oh, we're closing

603
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,475
the door now, okay.

604
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,645
That's not so easy.

605
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,897
Because of the language barrier?

606
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,942
That, and I implied,

607
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,942
when we were dating,

608
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,069
that I was... well-to-do.

609
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,114
Oh, Pastor Jeff,

610
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,114
why would you do that?

611
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,616
You saw her.

612
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,951
Uh, she is the kind of woman

613
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,954
that can make a man do

614
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,954
bad things.

615
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:23,083
Well, I... I don't know

616
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:23,083
what to say to that.

617
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,295
(exhales)

618
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,295
Maybe you ought to pray on it.

619
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,964
You're right.

620
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,423
You're absolutely right.

621
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,758
(chuckles softly)

622
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,926
I'll do that now.

623
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,135
I'll do the same.

624
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,303
Thank you.

625
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,764
(door opens)

626
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,770
God, please give me the strength

627
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,189
to not spread this juicy gossip

628
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,189
about Pastor Jeff.

629
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,066
(quietly):

630
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,066
Amen.

631
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,526
(sighs)

632
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,945
What are you doing?

633
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,322
I'm reading quietly, so I don't

634
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,322
have to lie about it later.

635
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,949
(gasps)

636
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,116
Found 'em.

637
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,702
The tweezers?

638
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,954
Mom's needles

639
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,954
and her magnifying glass.

640
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,497
Absolutely not.

641
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,165
Let me at least try.

642
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,208
No.

643
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,877
You're being a baby.

644
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,254
Nothing you can say

645
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,254
will change my mind.

646
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,006
What if it gets infected

647
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,006
and turns green

648
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,633
and they have to cut it off?

649
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:16,054
I think it's numb.

650
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,137
Great, put your hand out.

651
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,435
Wait, how do you plan

652
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,435
on sterilizing the needle?

653
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,729
Mom uses a lit match.

654
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,731
We're not allowed

655
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,731
to play with matches.

656
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,148
What else would work?

657
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,150
Alcohol.

658
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,994
Stick your finger in there.

659
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,161
I'll do the needle.

660
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,123
Okay. I hope I don't get drunk.

661
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,499
How long till you're sterile?

662
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,876
I don't know,

663
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,419
but I'm getting lightheaded.

664
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:54,341
No matter what happens,

665
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:54,341
hold still.

666
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,768
I can't do it.

667
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,561
Yes, you can.

668
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,561
No, I can't.

669
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,854
Just let me get it.

670
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,606
What if you slip

671
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,606
and stab me in the eye?

672
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,108
I'm not gonna slip.

673
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,110
Who always wins when we play...

674
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,112
(gasps)

675
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,112
Be right back.

694
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:15,255
<i>there were two heroes that day.</i>

695
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,346
Gee, how do you suppose

696
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,346
that happened?

697
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,141
Hello?

698
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,141
MISSY:

699
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,141
In here.

700
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:28,227
Why does the kitchen smell

701
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:28,227
like whiskey?

702
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,354
Ask her.

703
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,106
Oh, dear Lord!

704
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,318
Wait till you hear

705
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,318
what I did to Meemaw.

706
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,613
Our show came at number one.

707
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,781
<i>I did it! I did it!</i>

1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,378
I have a special treat

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,378
for y'all today.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,631
My dear friend and former

4
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,631
college roommate is here

5
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:07,215
from the Johnson Space Center

6
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,259
in Houston to talk to us

7
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,259
about our space program.

8
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,804
And yeah, I know

9
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,804
what you're thinking.

10
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,806
These guys were roomies.

11
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:15,223
How does one go on

12
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,893
to be a....

13
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,893
a fancy scientist at NASA,

14
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,103
and the other's teaching

15
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,103
freshman science

16
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,897
at a public high school?

17
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,899
Yeah, Sheldon.

18
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,693
I was thinking that.

19
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,820
Thank you.

20
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,739
All right, uh, let's

21
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,739
give a warm welcome

22
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:34,242
to my good buddy,

23
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:34,242
Dr. Ronald Hodges.

24
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,578
Hey, kids. Hey.

25
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,998
Glad to be here.

26
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,998
And, uh, Hubert, the answer

27
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,334
to your question is, one of

28
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,334
those roomies was busy studying

29
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,837
while the other was out

30
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,837
chasing high school girls.

31
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,046
(forced laugh)

32
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,046
(laughs)

33
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,423
Yeah.

34
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,551
To be clear, they

35
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,551
were all over 18.

36
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,219
(laughing):

37
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,219
Yeah. Well...

38
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,389
Now, what I thought would

39
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,389
be fun to talk about today

40
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,226
is what NASA's planning on doing

41
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,226
beyond the space shuttle.

42
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:02,062
Things like the first

43
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:02,062
manned mission to Mars.

44
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,105
Uh, yeah.

45
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,941
Did you see the movie<i> Aliens?</i>

46
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,401
I did.

47
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,194
Did you think it was cool?

48
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:11,446
Uh...

49
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,824
Sure, I enjoyed it.

50
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,116
Me, too.

51
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,244
Football player, right?

52
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,412
Yes, sir.

53
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,080
(laughing):

54
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,080
Yeah.

55
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,832
Now, of course, before

56
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,501
we can set out

57
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,501
to explore the solar system,

58
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,254
we've got a few minor problems

59
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,254
to overcome.

60
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,048
Not the least of

61
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,048
which is, every time

62
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,883
we launch,

63
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,883
it costs the U.S. taxpayers

64
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,886
hundreds of millions of dollars.

65
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:35,596
Oh, no, no, no.

66
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,472
Yes.

67
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,472
If you want

68
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,472
to save money,

69
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,433
why don't you land

70
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,433
the booster rockets

71
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,894
instead of letting them drop

72
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,894
in the ocean?

73
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,771
(laughs)

74
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:47,066
That's a cute idea, but, uh,

75
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:47,066
it's not technically possible.

76
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,859
Why not?

77
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,362
Well, it's hard to explain.

78
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,281
The math is pretty complicated.

79
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,908
Perhaps

80
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,908
I could help you with it.

81
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,826
(laughing):

82
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,826
Well,

83
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,828
I bet you could.

84
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,496
(laughs)

85
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,496
I'll bet you could.

86
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:05,166
I'll tell you what.

87
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:05,166
Here is a NASA patch.

88
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,586
Why don't you have your mom

89
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,586
sew that on your book bag? Now,

90
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,465
who here wants to know how

91
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,465
astronauts go to the bathroom?

92
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,967
BOY:

93
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,967
Me. I do.

94
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,967
Oh, right. See,

95
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,052
now, during liftoff,

96
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,052
all the astronauts

97
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:16,595
wear diapers.

98
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,513
ADULT SHELDON:

99
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,513
<i>People often wonder why I chose</i>

100
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,641
<i>to pursue a career</i>

101

102
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,769
<i>I usually respond by saying</i>

<i>I wanted to unravel the</i>

104
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:27,106
<i>inner workings of the universe.</i>

105
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,607
Yeah, perhaps when

106
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,318
Captain Kirk said,

107
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,318
"To boldly go,"

108
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,528
he meant in one of those, huh?

109
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,072
ADULT SHELDON:

110
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,072
<i>But the real answer was</i>

111
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:37,574
<i>I wanted</i>

112
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:37,574
<i>to prove this nincompoop wrong.</i>

113
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,367
Yeah, that's right.

00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,367

I'm putting together

my last will and testament.

127
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,978
We're gonna miss ya.

128
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,479
George.

129
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,606
Don't worry.

130
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,606
I ain't leaving him squat.

Are you dyin'?

132
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,317
We're all

133
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,317
dyin', honey.

134
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,902
From the second we're born,

135
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,696
it's just a slip and slide

136
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,696
into the darkness.

137
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,865
Unless you get

138
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,865
bit by a vampire.

139
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,826
Well, now that goes

140
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,826
without saying.

141
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,579
I don't want to die.

142
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,579
I've only kissed

143
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,747
one boy so far.

144
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:26,832
What?

145
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,292
Relax. It was a

146
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,292
long time ago.

147
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,753
Are you relaxed?

148
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,296
Shelly, you haven't

149
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,840
touched your dinner.

150
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,050
You feel okay?

151
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,677
Oh, yes. I was

152
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,677
just thinking.

153
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,387
About what, baby?

154
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:43,974
The optimal height-to-width

155
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:43,974
ratio for a reusable rocket.

156
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,600
MEEMAW:

157
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,600
I was just

158
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,519
thinking the exact same thing.

159
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,146
Really?

160
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,981
Oh, Moonpie, I love you so much.

161
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,315
(laughs)

162
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,740
(sighs)

163
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,745
(sucks air in through teeth)

164
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,756
It's late. What

165
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,756
are you doing up?

166
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,925
I'm working

167
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,925
on the hyperbolic calculations

168
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,466
for a rocket return.

169
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,969
Need any help?

170
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,138
What?

171
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,474
I'm kiddin'. Now, turn out

172
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,474
the light and go to bed.

173
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,935
But...

174
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,935
Now.

175
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,937
(sighs)

176
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:35,275
Dad, can we afford a computer?

177
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,986
You do my taxes.

178
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,986
What do you think?

179
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,988
Never mind.

180
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,282
Good night.

181
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,481
Meemaw?

182
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,278
Mr. Moonpie,

183
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,278
how might I help you?

184
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,156
How much money are you planning

185
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,156
to leave me when you die?

186
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,324
Nice talkin' to you.

187
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:27,119
(knocking)

188
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:27,119
Meemaw?

189
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,164
Want to try that again?

190
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,665
I need to buy a computer

191
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,917
so I can solve

192
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,917
the Navier-Stokes equation.

193
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,628
Uh-huh. How much is a computer?

194
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,006
Apple has a nice one for $2,000,

195
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,508
but the kind I need costs

196
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,508
three million.

197
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,678
Let me see

198
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,678
what I got in the vault.

199
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,932
(murmurs quietly)

200
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:52,186
Nine bucks and, uh...

201
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,607
Oh, look at that-- a peso.

202
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,028
It's warm.

203
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,286
Hello, First National Bank.

204
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,496
I'd like to speak

205
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,496
with a loan officer.

206
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,582
It's regarding a second mortgage

207
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,582
on my home.

208
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,460
My name is Sheldon Lee Cooper.

209
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,046
Sure, I'll hold.

210
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,299
Oh, I hate hold music.

211
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,842
Hello.

212
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,011
Yes, you can help me,

213
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,011
Dorothy Fitzpatrick.

214
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:29,723
I'm interested in taking out

215
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:29,723
a second mortgage.

216
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,475
I'm nine years old.

217
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,475
Why do you ask?

218
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:36,063
That's called

219
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:36,063
age discrimination, Dorothy,

220
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,732
but I'm willing to let it slide.

221
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:42,485
I'm glad you find me cute,

222
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:42,485
but I'm deadly serious.

223
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,072
I need funds to buy a computer.

224
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,032
No, the house isn't in my name.

225
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,117
I'm nine.

226
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,117
We've established this.

227
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,786
I do prepare the taxes

228
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,786
for my parents,

229
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,288
and if we tighten our belts,

230
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,582
we'll have sufficient equity

231
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,582
for the loan.

232
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,125
Sheldon, who are

233
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,125
you talking to?

234
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,378
Dorothy Fitzpatrick.

235
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,712
Who's Dorothy Fitzpatrick?

236
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,630
Is she a new buddy from school?

237
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,800
She's the loan officer at The

238
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,800
First National Bank of Medford.

239
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,052
Why are you talking to her?

240
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,678
Mom, can this wait?

241
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,847
I'm trying

242
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,847
to negotiate favorable terms.

243
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,308
Hello. Dorothy?

244
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,813
(whirring, beeps)

245
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,941
Hey, how come you

246
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,941
weren't in math class?

247
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,235
That guy from NASA

248
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,235
treated me like a child,

249
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,528
and I need to

250
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,528
prove him wrong.

251
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,988
You<i> are</i> a child.

252
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,573
Tread lightly, my friend.

253
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,868
Was Ms. Ingram upset

254
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,868
I wasn't in class?

255
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,536
(beeps)

256
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,536
TAM: Actually,

257
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,536
she was happy.

258
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,372
She even did a little dance.

259
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,498
Do you know anybody

260
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,498
with a modem?

261
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,960
I think

262
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,960
Radio Shack has one. Why?

263
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,129
I need to access

264
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,129
thrust-to-weight ratios

265
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,006
from the FTP server at

266
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,006
the Johnson Space Center.

267
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,300
Then what?

268
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,302
Then I show that guy

269
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,302
from NASA my work

270
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,511
and laugh as he

271
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,511
begs for mercy.

272
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,556
You know, sometimes

273
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,556
you sound like a super villain.

274
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,641
Silence!

275
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,393
That'll be more effective after

276
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:57,894
your voice changes.

277
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,272
(sighs)

278
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,149
(in deep voice):

279
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,149
Silence.

280
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,400
(beeps)

281
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,610
Mom, can you take me

282
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,610
to Radio Shack?

283
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,279
Not today, baby.

284
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,990
I have to go food shopping

285
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,990
and get dinner started.

286
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,992
But it's important.

287
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,994
Sorry. Maybe over the weekend.

288
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,870
But it won't take that long.

289
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,580
Sheldon, I said no.

290
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,334
But, Mom...

291
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,334
Not another word.

292
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,170
What?

293
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,339
Can't I just be happy?

294
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,010
Mom, please!

295
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,552
Sheldon Lee,

296
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,552
I said no.

297
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,679
I'm still happy.

298
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,143
Please, Mom!

299
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,143
You're being unfair!

300
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,020
No.

301
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,020
But I really need those

302
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,020
thrust-to-weight ratios.

303
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,272
Do you see I'm cookin'?

304
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,274
Well, take me<i> after</i> dinner.

305
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,401
Enough! I'm not takin' you

306
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,401
anywhere tonight.

307
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,694
(grunts)

308
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,279
ADULT SHELDON:

309
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,279
<i>I'm not proud of it,</i>

310
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,406
<i>but as a child, I was prone...</i>

311
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,241
<i>to the occasional meltdown.</i>

312
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,826
SHELDON:

313
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,826
Cheese and crackers!

314
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,204
ADULT SHELDON:

315
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,204
<i>I'm sorry you had to hear that.</i>

316
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,584
All right,

317
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,584
I finally got him calmed down.

318
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,212
How'd you manage that?

319
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,755
Easy. Gave him a hug

320
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,755
and a little cough syrup.

321
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,341
Mom!

322
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,759
It's not like he's

323
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,759
operating heavy machinery.

324
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,221
We can't keep putting

325
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,221
up with this behavior.

326
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,056
We need to ground him.

327
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,059
How? If you say "No playing

328
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,059
outside," he says, "Thank you."

329
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,643
Well, we need to do something.

330
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,812
It's just a tantrum.

331
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,812
It's what kids do.

332
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,814
You used to punish me

333
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,814
all the time.

334
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:28,068
That was different.

335
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:28,068
You were a pain in the ass.

336
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,986
I say no Radio Shack

337
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,986
for at least a month.

338
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,279
Sounds fair.

339
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,447
I'll go tell him.

340
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,282
I'd wait and tell him tomorrow.

341
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,201
He's a little loopy right now.

342
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,786
(laughs)

343
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,332
Good night.

344
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,584
She drugged our son.

345
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,713
ADULT SHELDON:

346
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,713
<i>Thus began the longest month</i>

347
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,713
<i>of my life.</i>

348
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:54,219
<i>Without the ability to access</i>

349
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:54,219
<i>the thrust-to-weight ratios,</i>

350
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:57,222
<i>my well-intended effort</i>

351
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:57,222
<i>to humiliate a NASA scientist</i>

352
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,099
<i>ground to a halt.</i>

353
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,225
Mom.

354
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,185
Uh... what's going on?

355
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,396
Something's wrong with Sheldon.

356
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,856
(groaning)

357
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,234
What's the matter, baby?

358
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,234
Have a tummy ache?

359
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,402
I think it's an ulcer.

360
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,861
GEORGE SR.:

361
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,861
Don't be silly.

362
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,363
You must have eaten

363
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,363
something.

364
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,363
No.

365
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:16,450
My symptoms are consistent

366
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:16,450
with an ulcer.

367
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,201
Shelly, remember

368
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,201
when you thought

369
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,246
you had leprosy, and it was

370
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,246
just a patch of dry skin?

371
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,165
And when you thought you had

372
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,165
gout? Or an enlarged prostate?

373
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,375
Or mad cow?

374
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,043
That was my favorite.

375
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,836
Well, this is different.

376
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,756
Maybe we should take

377
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,756
him to the doctor.

378
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,760
Listen to your wife--

379
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,760
ulcers are serious.

380
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,387
Ow.

381
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,432
Well, I've never seen this

382
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,432
in someone so young,

383
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,393
but, uh, your son has an ulcer.

384
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,561
Thank you.

385
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,062
How could this happen?

386
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,398
Uh, there are

387
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,398
a number of factors.

388
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,899

It's time to take my Zantac.

582
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,866
(mumbles softly):

583
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,866
Oh...

584
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,912
He's been in there

585
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,912
quite a while.

586
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,455
Well, if the topic

587
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,374
is science, he can be

588
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,374
a really Chatty Patty.

589
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,626
I'm bored.

590
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,419
Me, too.

591
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,419
Hey.

592
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,963
Someday somebody's gonna write

593
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,963
a book about Sheldon.

594
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,299
Don't you want there

595
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,299
to be a chapter

596
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,803
about how loving and supportive

597
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,803
you two were?

598
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,096
Doesn't matter.

599
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,096
I ain't reading it.

600
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,768
This is groundbreaking work.

601
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,728
Thank you. And...?

602
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,229
And...?

603
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,189
I thought you might want

604
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,189
to apologize.

605
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,107
Well...

606
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,692
why?

607
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,445
You tried to shut me up

608
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,445
with a patch.

609
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,448
(chuckles nervously):

610
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,448
Well... I-I give those

611
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,448
to everyone.

612
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,032
A-And you have

613
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,032
to understand, Sheldon,

614
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,286
that while your math

615
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,286
is-is theoretically correct,

616
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:39,081
we don't have the technical

617
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:39,081
capability to execute it.

618
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,083
So I'm ahead of my time?

619
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,211
Well... it would appear so.

620
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,211
(chuckles)

621
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,547
All right, call me

622
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,547
when you catch up.

623
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,675

624
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,343

00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:04,630
A simile directly compares

2
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:04,630
two things,

3
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:07,341
using the words "like" and "as."

4
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,426
"I slept

5
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,426
like a log."

6
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:11,553
"I'm hungry as a horse."

7
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:14,055
"Your love is like

8
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:14,055
bad medicine."

9
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,223
Exactly.

10
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,391
That's Bon Jovi.

11
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,101
Okay.

Moving on.

14
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:24,107
Metaphors are different

15
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:24,107

Well, Mary, in a case like this,

73
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:07,502
a few days of detention.

74
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,503
Really? That seems

75
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,503
a little harsh.

76
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:11,465

my attention.

00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,139

give me some tips.

189
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,275
you go with him.

190
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,692
Why?

191
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,195
'Cause you're gonna

192
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,195
get your "A" word kicked.

00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,366
in school

197
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,077
in one room for an hour.

198
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,288
What do you think's

199
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,288
gonna happen?

200
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,706
I thought we were gonna spend

201
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,706
the time regretting our actions

202
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,709
and thinking about how we could

203
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,709
be better in the future.

204
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,920
Well, you thought wrong.

205
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,920
Get lost.

206
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,965
You're both mean

207
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,965
and nice to me.

208
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,092
It's confusing.

209
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,973
(gags)

210
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,602
Maybe I'm doing this wrong.

211
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,771
(school bell rings)

212
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,401
Have you ever been in detention?

213
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,486
No.

214
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,571
But I do take

215
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,571
the school bus.

216
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,532
And that is no party.

217
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,160
It's like a mental hospital

218
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,160
on wheels.

219
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,787
That's a good use of simile.

220
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:11,955
Thanks.

221
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,874
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

222
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,670
I hope.

223
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,214
(door closes)

224
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,423
(school bell rings)

225
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,423
(footsteps rapidly departing)

226
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:33,268
Hello. I'm here

227
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:33,268
for detention.

228
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,312
Where is the teacher?

229
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:38,773
Not here yet.

230
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,441
Oh.

231
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,032
I have three dollars.

232
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,825
Feel free to share it

233
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,825
with the others.

234
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,919
Would you prefer

235
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,919
a piece of paper?

236
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,004
I have some

237
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,004
in my briefcase.

238
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,716
It's here

239
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,716
if you change your mind.

240
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,634
All right, losers,

241
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,634
you know how this works.

242
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,054
One hour, no talking,

243
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,054
no horseplay.

244
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,347
Sheldon?

245
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,973
Hello, Mr. Givens.

246
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,433
Why are you here?

247
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,685
I didn't want to catch a cold

248
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,685
from Ms. MacElroy,

249
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,355
so I left her classroom

250
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,355
without a hall pass.

251
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,648
Well, something<i> is</i> going around.

252
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,026
I actually had a little tickle

253
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,026
in my throat.

254
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,779
Okay, time to go.

255
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,779
Nice meeting you.

256
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,072
Whoa, what-what are you doing?

257
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,907
You've heard of

258
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,907
fight or flight?

259
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,784
This is flight.

260
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,871
Not so funny

261
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,871
now, is it?

262
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,748
No. How long

263
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,748
is he suspended for?

264
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,958
A week.

265
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,377
And it goes on

266
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,377
his permanent record.

267
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,129
Well, that's

268
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,129
no big deal.

269
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,590
I had all kinds of stuff on my

270
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,590
permanent high school record.

271
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,969
Didn't stop me from being

272
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,969
a bartender for eight years.

273
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,972
I think the real issue we need

274
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,972
to deal with is his germ phobia.

275
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,181
Oh, yes,

276
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,181
you don't

277
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,766
want him turning

278
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,766
into Howard Hughes.

279
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,684
Growing his nails out.

280
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,437
Peeing in a jar.

281
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,689
Why would he pee into a jar?

282
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,689
I don't know why

283
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,689
he peed in a jar,

284
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,483
I just know he did.

285
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,193
(sighs)

286
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,193
I hate to say it,

287
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,070
but I think

288
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,070
we need help with this.

289
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,655
Like what?

290
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,655
Maybe we could

291
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,158
take him to that nice doctor

292
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,158
who calmed him down

293
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,660
when he was convinced

294
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,660
he had an enlarged prostate?

295
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,329
Sheldon only calmed down

296
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,329
when the doctor told him

297
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,289
what happens in a prostate exam.

298
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,832
Poor thing.

299
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,834
Still talks about it.

300
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,629
<i>Thank you for seeing us,</i>

301
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,629
<i>Doctor.</i>

302
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,381
No problem.

303
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,968
So, what do you got today,

304
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,968
Sheldon?

305
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,304
Rickets?

306
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,304
Rabies?

307
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,347
Early-onset menopause?

308
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,974
Is he making a joke?

309
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,517
I believe so.

310
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,893
Humorous.

311
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:40,979
Hmm.

312
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:40,979
Sheldon's not sick,

313
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,731
but he has become overly

314
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,731
concerned with getting a cold

315
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,151
or the flu.

316
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,151
Well, any symptoms--

317
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,652
runny nose, achy,

318
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,779
sore throat, fever?

319
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,779
No.

320
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,949
All right, well, Sheldon,

321
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,949
if you do catch a cold,

322
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,370
or even the flu, it's...

323
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,370
it's not the end of the world.

324
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,622
The flu was the end of the world

325
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,622
for half a million Americans

326
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,708
during the influenza epidemic

327
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,708
of 1918.

328
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,960
Really?

329
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,960
In India

330
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,463
17 million people died.

331
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,715
Okay, I think we're getting

332
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,715
off the subject. Doctor,

333
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,258
Sheldon is afraid

334
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,258
to go to school

335
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,634
because he might get exposed

336
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,137
to some kind of bacteria

337
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,137
or virus.

338
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,306
So he's got a phobia?

339
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,350
It's not a phobia

340
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,350
if the threat is real.

341
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,268
You're a doctor,

342
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,268
you should know that.

343
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,689
Sheldon, you have

344
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,689
nothing to worry about.

345
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,566
Even if you did get the flu,

346
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,235
it's usually over in a week.

347
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,946
Why are we getting medical

348
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,946
advice from a man who smokes?

349
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,740
Sheldon.

350
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,740
O-Okay,

351
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,159
I have patients

352
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,159
who are actually sick.

353
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,078
Maybe we should wrap this up.

354
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,621
How come you don't

355
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,621
get sick all the time?

356
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,332
Well, I take precautions.

357
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:46,169
I wash my hands,

358
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:46,169
I wear gloves and a mask.

359
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,349
So, Mom, how was your day?

360
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,520
We're ignoring this?

361
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,646
Okay.

362
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,824
So pretty.

363
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,659
What's going on?

364
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,079
I'm not feeling so good.

365
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,622
(coughs loudly)

366
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,999
Biohazard! Biohazard!

367
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,710
Sucker.

368
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,463
WOMAN (on TV):

369
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,463
In national news,

370
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:33,425
an unusually early flu season

371
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:33,425
is buffeting the country.

372
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,677
Doctors say the strain,

373
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,677
originating in China,

374
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,972
is particularly severe.

375
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:43,518
Children and the elderly

376
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:43,518
are most at risk.

377
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,937
Sheldon, why are

378
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,937
you still up?

379
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,981
We're all gonna die!

380
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,274
...about the local cattle...

381
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,358
This isn't funny!

382
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,486
I know, baby, I know.

383
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:56,406
But you need to

384
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:56,406
understand that sometimes

385
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,992
the news says those things

386
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,992
just to scare people.

387
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,452
Well, it's working!

388
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:01,953
Come here.

389
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,497
I know you don't

390
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,497
believe in this,

391
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,290
but I'm gonna

392
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,290
do it anyway.

393
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,707
(sighs)

394
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,836
Lord, I pray for

395
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,836
my son Sheldon

396
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,589
that you protect him from

397
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,589
all illness and disease,

398
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,383
and keep him healthy

399
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,383
and keep him safe,

400
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,470
and protect him from

401
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,470
his head to his toes,

402
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,389
inside and out. Amen.

403
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,726
You're right.

404
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,726
I don't believe in that.

405
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:31,191
But it did feel good. Thanks.

406
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,735
In the Bible, that's called

407
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,735
a hedge of protection.

408
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,573
Why do you keep smiling?

409
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:42,536
You need to look

410
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:42,536
at your mask, baby.

411
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:47,081
SHELDON:

412
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:47,081
Missy?!

413
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,378
We have to go to school,

414
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,378
and Sheldon doesn't?

415
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,671
That's not fair.

416
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,671
Sure it is.

417
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,713
Sheldon loves school

418
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,713
and can't go.

419
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,091
You hate school

420
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,091
and have to. Fair.

421
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,968
GEORGE SR.:

422
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,968
He still has

423
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,470
to spend his day doing chores.

424
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,681
Can't sit around

425
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,681
playing with his trains.

426
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,807
Yeah, put him to work.

427
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,807
Good parenting, Dad.

428
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,518
Oh, I'm glad you approve.

429
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,395
I do.

430
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,480
Where you going?

431
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,440
I'm gonna give Sheldon

432
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,440
a list of chores.

433
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,359
You're actually

434
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,359
taking my advice?

435
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,652
Yes.

436
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:16,903
Well, how about that?

437
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,198
Hey, you were due.

438
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,782
(door closes)

439
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,285
Proud of you, George.

440
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,712
Sheldon?

441
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,171
Yes.

442
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,965
The door's locked.

443
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,965
Can you open it?

444
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,134
No.

445
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,803
What on earth?

446
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,649
Hello.

447
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,649
What are you doing?

448
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,818
I made a real germ-proof

449
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,818
hedge of protection.

450
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,655
Oh, honey,

451
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,655
you can't stay in there.

452
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,824
I've got a refrigerator,

453
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,824
I've got my sleeping bag,

454
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,453
and anything else I need

455
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,453
I can make out of Legos.

456
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,497
What's with

457
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,497
the Halloween costume?

458
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,502
In case of a breach.

459
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,672
Stay right there.

460
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,048
That's my plan.

461
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,175
George?

462
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,390
Just when you think

463
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,390
he's gonna zig,

464
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,100
you get

465
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,100
a big old zag.

466
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,018
It's ridiculous. I'm...

467
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,018
I'm gonna take it down.

468
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,271
No, you can't force him out

469
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,271
of a phobia.

470
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,481
What do we do?

471
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,690
He can't live

472
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,690
in there.

473
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,191
Well, actually, he can.

474
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,319
He's got the refrigerator

475
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,319
and a sleeping bag.

476
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,613
And he can always

477
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,613
go potty in the sink.

478
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:45,032
I think I'll take

479
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:45,032
the kids to school.

480
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,160
I'm sure he'll be out

481
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,160
by the time you get home.

482
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,746
Not sure why you

483
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,746
think that, but okay.

484
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,956
Mom?

485
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,956
Yes, Shelly.

486
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,249
Can you close the door?

487
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,376
I need to use the sink.

488
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,424
(Meemaw laughs)

489
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,593
Tammy Cook?

490
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,593
Here.

491
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,137
Georgie Cooper?

492
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,137
Here.

493
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,682
Sheldon Cooper? Absent.

494
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,849
Where's your brother?

495
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,849
Home.

496
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,310
Is he okay?

497
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,269
Yeah, he's just...

498
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,521
(bell dings)

499
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,398
Actually, it's not

500
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,398
looking good for him.

501
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,108
He might not make it.

502
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,861
Oh, that's terrible.

503
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,861
I know.

504
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,988
I love him so much.

505
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:28,034
If anything ever happened,

506
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:28,034
I don't know what I'd do.

507
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,244
Aw.

508
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,877
MARY:

509
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,877
Shelly, if you don't mind

510
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,005
me asking, what's your

511
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,005
long-term plan here?

512
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,005
I'm working

513
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,674
on the math to turn the garage

514
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,176
into a self-sustaining

515
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,176
ecosystem.

516
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,721
Okay. And what exactly

517
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,721
does that mean?

518
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,721
Well, all I need

519
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,598
is sunlight and a few seeds

520
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,598
to grow unlimited food

521
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,476
which I'll fertilize

522
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,476
with my own feces.

523
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,395
(laughing):

524
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,395
This just gets better.

525
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,480
If you're not gonna

526
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,480
help, please go inside.

527
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,190
This is not a show.

528
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,317
Now that's where I disagree.

529
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,736
(sighs)

530
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,736
(giggles)

531
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,863
Shelly, baby,

532
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,863
please come on out.

533
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,280
I can't.

534
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,115
Come on.

535
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,115
I'm your mommy.

536
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,784
Do it for your mommy.

537
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:10,993
No.

538
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,203
(sighs)

539
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,496
But I'm your mommy.

540
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,540
(laughing):

541
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,540
Y'all are killing me.

542
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,208
(laughing)

543
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,794
(sighs)

544
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,794
(laughing):

545
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,794
"I'm your mommy."

546
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:24,298
I think the saddest part

547
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:24,298
about it is just how sad it is.

548
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,384
Is there anything

549
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,384
that we can do?

550
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,428
I don't know.

551
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,263
A hug might help.

552
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,348
Of course.

553
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,934
What's wrong

554
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,934
with you two?

555
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,728
Don't you care

556
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,728
about my brother?

557
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,859
(fake crying)

558
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,694
Aw.

559
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:48,489
(crying):

560
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:48,489
Oh, Sheldon.

561
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,408
That's it. I've had

562
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,408
enough of this nonsense.

563
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,869
If you don't come out,

564
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,869
I'm coming in!

565
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,496
One, two,

566
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,457
three.

567
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,457
Breach! Breach!

right this instant!

570
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,835
No.

571
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,378
Oh!

00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,048

579

I don't have to do it forever.

580
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,473

00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,933
MEEMAW:

00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,933
Mary,

583
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,559
I'm gonna run

584
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,559

607
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,016
Oh, a little trick I learned

608
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,185
trying to get prairie dogs

609
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,185
out of the hole.

610
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,896
Of course we'd whack off

Oh, Moon Pie,

617
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,616
I've got a little treat for you.

618
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,576
Chocolate chip?

619
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,996
Mm-hmm, right out of the oven.

620
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,164
Good. That means

621
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,164
they're sterile.

622
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,708

623
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,502
Why don't you come on out here

624
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,502
and... have a couple?

625
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,753
I can't do that.

626
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,381
Okay, I tell you what.

627
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,884
I'm gonna just put 'em

628
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,884
right out here,

629
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:34,136

630
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:34,136
and get one when you're ready.

631
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,973
How about that?

632
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,973
I'm gonna put 'em down

633
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,767
right... here.

634
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,939
Aah! (laughs)

635
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,567
Come on! Oh. (laughs)

636
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,571
Listen to me, buster.

637
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,531
Okay.

638
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,531
You are

639
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,949
a lot of things, Sheldon.

640
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:58,619
You are cute, smart, hygienic.

641
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,333
But most of all...

642
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:08,170
you... are a Texan.

643
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,505
So?

644
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,007
So Texans

645
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,551
aren't afraid of nothin'!

646
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,803
Rattlesnakes, Indians,

647
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,014

648
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:24,979
Do you imagine that Sam Houston

649
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:24,979
was scared of a little old cold?

650
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,230
No.

651
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,190
Jim Bowie?

652
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,525
No.

653
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:33,195
Sissy Spacek?

654
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,822
I... guess not?

655
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,283
You're damn right,

656
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,283
because they're Texans

657
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,952
through and through.

658
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,621
Now I want you to quit hiding

659
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,621
in this plastic bubble,

660
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,664
and I want you to

661
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,664
come out here and

662
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,709

663
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,709

664
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,252

666
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,985
I'm impressed.

667
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,569
Me, too.

668
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,238

669
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,238

670
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,241

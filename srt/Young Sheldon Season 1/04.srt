George, help!

22
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,746
Come here, boy. We got it.

23
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,746

Sure.

You have the coolest excuse.

00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,392
You almost died.

00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,392
Did you see Jesus?

00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,145
I saw Count Chocula.

94
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:28,565

98
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,114

a medical emergency?

Yes, ma'am.

Have you ever read one?

when I was three.

139
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,307
Just eat your lunch.

What's the matter?

141
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,662
I-I don't think

142
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,662
I can eat this.

00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,039
You want to trade?

"I'm not hungry."

that Mr. Rosenbloom

158
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:33,232
with the furniture store

159
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:33,232
over by the steakhouse?

160
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,901
I don't think so.

161
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,901
Oh, sure you do.

162
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,569
That Hebrew fella

with the comb-over?

164
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,071
You mean Jewish?

165
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,281
I think they like

166
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,281
to be called Hebrew.

167
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,991
Anyway,

168
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,743
he's asked me to dinner.

Well, good for you.

00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,538
What'd you say?

172
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,916
I said I'd have

173
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,916
to think about it.

174
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,084
What's to think about?

175
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,961
Well, a lot.

176
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,047
I mean, assuming he enjoys

177
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,047
dinner, he might want

178
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:58,590
a scoop of Meemaw for dessert.

179
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,050
Mom, the kids.

180
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,094
I said "dessert."

181
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:04,387
Did you know

182
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:04,387
I was talking about sex?

183
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,764
No.

184
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,224
See?

185
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,269
Why aren't you eating?

186
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,729
I don't think I can.

187
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,856
Sometimes the different foods

188
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,856
touch each other, Sheldon.

189
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,691
Not the end of the world.

190
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,069
No, I'm afraid I'll choke again.

191
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,947
Oh, honey, that's

192
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,947
not gonna happen.

193
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,364
Go ahead, eat your dinner.

194
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,866
What's all this about choking?

195
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,743
Sheldon almost died

196
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,743
this morning.

197
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,495
What?!

198
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,495
Oh, yeah.

199
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,872
Dad was shaking him upside down

200
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,872
like a ketchup bottle.

201
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,249
It was great.

202
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,834
Well, you got to eat

203
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,834
something, baby.

204
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,043
Just have a few bites.

205
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,671
I can't. It's too risky.

206
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,089
Dibs on the tater tots.

207
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,841
All right, I'll wrap

208
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,841
that up for you,

209
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,510
and if you change your mind,

210
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,510
you can have some later.

211
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,636
At least drink your milk.

212
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,138
Sure.

213
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,347
ADULT SHELDON:

214
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,347
<i>My mother and father saw</i>

215
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,434
<i>that I'd been traumatized and</i>

216
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,434
<i>were patient and understanding</i>

217
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,479
<i>about my fear</i>

218
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,479
<i>of eating solid foods.</i>

219
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,355
<i>This lasted one more day.</i>

220
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,983
MARY: Sheldon Lee Cooper,

221
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,983
if you don't

222
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,068
finish that pork chop,

223
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,068
I swear I will chew it up

224
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,653
and spit it in your mouth

225
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,653
like a mama bird.

226
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,655
Do it, Mom. Do it.

227
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,033
Mary, can I speak to you

228
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,033
for a second?

229
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,033
No. Enough is enough.

230
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,201
The boy has got to eat.

231
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,577
Just give me a minute.

232
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,081
Start eating, mister.

233
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,837
You don't mind, right?

234
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,175
How about I cut that

235
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,175
pork chop off the bone

236
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,969
and throw it in the

237
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,969
blender with some gravy?

238
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:30,182
If it fits through

239
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:30,182
a bendy straw, I'll drink it.

240
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,517
Coming up.

241
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,020
Why does he get a pork shake?

242
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,688
This is all my fault.

243
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,190
I rushed him through

244
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,190
breakfast the other day,

245
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,192
and now look--

246
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,192
he is wasting away.

247
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,236
Oh, come on.

248
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,236
You can't blame yourself.

249
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,445
This isn't gonna last. Remember

250
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,445
the time a bee got in the house

251
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,906
and he slept under a net

252
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,906
for a couple months?

253
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,949
This is different.

254
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,243
How?

255
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,243
First of all,

256
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,244
you let that bee in.

257
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,370
The bee was your fault.

258
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,871
Okay.

259
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,871
Secondly,

260
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,081
this is about his health.

261
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,207
He is a fragile little boy.

262
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,541
He can't go on like this.

263
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,335
I'm not arguing with you.

264
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,921
Let's just, you know,

265
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,921
give him a little more time.

266
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,256
(sighs)

267
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,466
(blender whirring)

268
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,426
Now what?

269
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,512
Sounds like your mom's

270
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,512
making margaritas.

271
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,556
(slurps)

272
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,683
What's he drinking?

273
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,685
Pork chop and gravy.

274
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,938
(quietly): I snuck

275
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,938
some broccoli in there, too.

276
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,774
Shh...

277
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,152
(slurps)

278
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,123
(whirring)

279
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,626
I'm real glad

280
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,626
you've been getting out again.

281
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,336
Me, too. (chuckles)

282
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,880
We had a nice dinner,

283
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,880
took a walk.

284
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,715
He's a divorcé, you know.

285
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,259
I didn't.

286
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,261
It's not a big deal

287
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,261
for those people.

288
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:52,013
If they're not a lawyer,

289
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:52,013
they're related to one.

290
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,807
GEORGE SR.: You're actually

291
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,807
cutting the crust off

292
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,642
before you blend it?

293
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,642
I left it

294
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,228
on his tuna sandwich yesterday,

295
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,228
he said he could tell.

296
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,854
Only drank half of it.

297
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,065
Mary, you think this has

298
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,065
gone on long enough?

299
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,608
No trouble.

300
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,944
But it'd be better

301
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,944
if I had two blenders.

302
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,570
Be better if you stopped

303
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,570
coddling him.

304
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,489
Well, I don't know

305
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,489
what else to do.

306
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,408
I suggested that we take him

307
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,408
to some kind of professional,

308
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,993
but you said he'd outgrow it.

309
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,577
Well, if you're looking

310
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,577
for a psychiatrist,

311
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,622
I bet my new fella's

312
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,622
related to one.

313
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,209
What do you think?

314
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,919
(sighs)

315
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,796
Not sure.

316
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,257
If we take him to a shrink,

317
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,257
it feels like we're admitting

318
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,591
something's wrong with him.

319
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,136
He hasn't had solid food

320
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,136
in five weeks.

321
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,764
Well, if there is

322
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,764
something wrong with him,

323
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,599
it ain't constipation.

324
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,184
(laughing)

325
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,398
Okay.

326
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,400
Let's see if we

327
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,400
can find somebody.

328
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,235
Thank you.

329
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,820
(sighs):

330
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,820
Hmm.

331
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,159
(clicks tongue)

332
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,411
Needs a few more Cheetos.

333
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,580
ADULT SHELDON:<i> My mother managed</i>

334
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,580
<i>to locate a family psychiatrist</i>

335
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,582
<i>within our price range.</i>

336
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,626
<i>No one seemed to be bothered</i>

337
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,626
<i>that he had</i>

338
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,505
<i>a coupon in</i> The Pennysaver.

339
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,549
Is this man gonna make me

340
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,549
eat solid foods?

341
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,551
No, he just wants to

342
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,551
talk to you about it.

343
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,221
Did you tell him I have

344
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,221
a lot to accomplish in my life

345
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,765
and cannot afford to be killed

346
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,765
by an unchewed sausage?

347
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,560
Not in those exact words.

348
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,940
Did you bring

349
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,940
the coupon?

350
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,942
Hi. Welcome.

351
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,486
You must be the Cooper family.

352
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,653
We are.

353
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:31,946
Right on, right on.

354
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,407
This must be Sheldon.

355
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,200
Put 'er there.

356
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,369
No, thank you.

357
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,287
Right on, right on.

358
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,040
Okay, well, here's how

359
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,040
I'd like to start. Mom and Dad,

360
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,917
why don't you come talk to me

361
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,917
first, and then, Sheldon,

362
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,668
you and I have

363
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,668
a little rap session.

364
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,088
Folks?

365
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,345
(quietly):

366
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,345
Right on, right on.

367
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,931
Feel free to read

368
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,931
any of my comics.

369
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,354
And you guys feel free

370
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,354
to sit on my beanbag!

371
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,944
40 cents? Outrageous.

372
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,946
ADULT SHELDON:

373
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,946
<i>As fate would have it,</i>

374
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,199
<i>the comic I picked up</i>

375
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,199
<i>was called</i> X-Men.

376
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,577
<i>Young mutants</i>

377
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,577
<i>with incredible powers</i>

378
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,995
<i>who were feared</i>

379
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,995
<i>and misunderstood</i>

380
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,663
<i>by the entire world.</i>

381
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,459
Hey, it's about me.

382
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,669
Now, the thing

383
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,669
you have to understand is

384
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,838
Shelly is

385

386
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,425
I mean, his IQ is right up there

387
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,425
with Albert Einstein

388
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,969
and that English

389
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,969

390
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,346
Cool.

391

He's nine years old

392
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,932
and he's in high school, so you

393
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,932
can't judge him like other kids.

394
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,517

400

00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,000
a special little boy.

414
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,668
In the fourth grade,

415
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,668

416
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,295

417
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,130

418

419
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,923
by the seventh grade.

420
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,344
Tenth.

421

446

197
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,307
Grammar.

198
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,059
I ain't great

199
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,059
with grammar.

200
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:12,146
Well, grammar's just talking,

201
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:12,146
and we both talk good.

202
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,815
I guess. Gimme.

203
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,070
There's a list of sentences,

204
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,070
and you're supposed to say

205
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,572
if each one's a complete

206
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,572
sentence or not.

207
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,616
GEORGE JR.:

208
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,616
The first one is,

209
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,160
"Most people

210
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,160
in the country."

211
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,536
That doesn't sound

212
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,536
like a sentence.

213
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,580
But ask me who drives

214
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,580
pickup trucks.

215
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:33,208
Who drives pickup trucks?

216
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,002
Most people in the country.

217
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,171
Well, now it does

218
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,171
sound like one.

219
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,380
I told you, it's confusing.

220
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,092
I can't help you.

221
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,469
(sighs)

222
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,721
ROCKY: If you don't want me

223
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,721
mixing with Creed no more...

224
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,933
Do you think we're stupid?

225
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,060
Sheldon's in college

226
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,060
right now,

227
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,021
and we can't figure out

228
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,021
<i>your</i> homework.

229
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,396
What do you think?

230
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,357
Sometimes I tell myself

231
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,357
I only look stupid

232
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,195
because he's so smart.

233
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,905
ADRIAN:

234
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,905
Win.

235
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,951
Give me the book.

236
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,374
Don't just sit there,

237
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,374
make me a sandwich.

238
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,085
Coming up.

239
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,213
(theme music playing on TV)

240
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,679
Hello.

241
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,679
Hello.

242
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:32,226
Forgive me, but is that pattern

243
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:32,226
a double basket weave?

244
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,728
Um, I suppose so.

245
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,814
I've always just called it

246
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,814
a "loop-loop whoopsie-do."

247
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,816
(both laugh)

248
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,693
Well, it's very

249
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,693
impressive.

250
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,861
Do you knit?

251
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,698
No, but it's always

252
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,698
intrigued me.

253
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,283
Believe it or not,

254
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,912
the first computer

255
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,912
was a loom.

256
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,247
Is that so?

257
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,248
It is.

258
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,124
Well, okay.

259
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,668
Okay.

260
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,923
Well, if you'll

261
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,923
excuse me, uh,

262
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,299
I have a class to teach.

263
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,177
Oh, you must be

264
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,177
my grandson's pen pal.

265
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,178
I'm sorry?

266
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,596
Sheldon Cooper.

267
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,640
The nine-year-old with

268
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,640
the flawless penmanship.

269
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,226
I look forward

270
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,226
to meeting him.

271
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,644
Well, he's right in there.

272
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,644
You can't miss him.

273
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,896
He's about yea big.

274
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,896
Oh.

275
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:21,108
An-An-And will you

276
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:21,108
be joining us?

277
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,861
Will you be discussing

278
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,861
quantum chromodynamics?

279
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,071
I certainly hope so.

280
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,657
Then I don't think so.

281
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,657
Are you sure?

282
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,953
Every day is a chance

283
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,953
to learn something new.

284
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,913
Can I ask questions?

285
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,332
Well, how else

286
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,332
can you learn?

287
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,959
Well, let's do it, then.

288
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,252
(both chuckle)

289
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,338
My name's John.

290
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,631
And I'm Connie.

291
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,091
My middle name's Whitney.

292
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,926
And now I know that.

293
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:52,306
Well, I'm so glad

294
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:52,306
you enjoyed it.

295
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,848
So, Sheldon,

296
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,848
what did you think

297
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,726
of your first

298
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,726
theoretical physics class?

299
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,938
I think I'm gonna do this

300
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,938
for the rest of my life.

301
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,274
Good choice.

302
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,067
Connie, I would like

303
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,067
to see you again.

304
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,445
Perhaps we could

305
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,445
have dinner sometime.

306
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,655
Yes, we would love that.

307
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,115
We would?

308
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:10,907
We wouldn't?

309
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,117
You wouldn't?

310
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,493
We would.

311
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,036
Excellent.

312
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,457
Excellent.

313
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,457
So, where are we eating?

314
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,126
Okay, this says

315
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,126
"a complete sentence

316
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,669
always contains a verb."

317
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,212
Which one's a verb?

318
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,798
"A verb is a word that

319
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,798
describes an action.

320
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,759
I<i> play</i> checkers.

321
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,759
You<i> eat</i> spaghetti."

322
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,095
We<i> suck</i> at homework.

323
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,763
The action is sucking.

324
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,597
So, the first one

325
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,597
on your homework is,

326
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,476
"Most people

327
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,476
in the country."

328
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,436
I don't see

329
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,436
an action word.

330
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,229
Neither do I.

331
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,274
Georgie, I don't think

332
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,274
this is a sentence.

333
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:45,525
I think you're right.

334
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,110
Now I just have

335
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,110
to fix it.

336
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,154
Put a verb in there, girl.

337
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,869
I think you might be getting

338
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,869
a little ahead of yourself.

339
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,413
I don't think so.

340
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,413
They're in love.

341
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,123
They were looking into

342
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,123
each other's eyes

343
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,416
like there was

344
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,416
something in there

345
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,418
other than corneas

346
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,418
and irises.

347
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,338
Well, if that's the case,

348
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,338
that'd be wonderful.

349
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,089
It'd be more than wonderful.

350
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,342
If they get married,

351
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,342
we immediately double

352
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,511
the number of smart people

353
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,511
in our family.

354
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,472
That means we go

355
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,472
from one to two.

356
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,432
I got that.

357
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,393
So, did you understand

358
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,393
any of it?

359
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,977
Not a word.

360
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,977
(laughs)

361
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,356
But he had on a tweed jacket

362
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,356
with the elbow patches,

363
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,025
so he must know

364
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,025
what he's talking about.

365
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,361
Boy, Sheldon's fired up.

366
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,945
Oh, he loved it.

367
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,031
He sat there for

368
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,031
an hour and a half

369
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,242
just as happy as

370
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,242
a pig in poop.

371
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,868
He mentioned you were

372
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,868
pretty happy

373
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,870
about the whole experience, too.

374
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,248
Well, I guess

375
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,248
Mr. Wizard did take

376
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,790
a bit of a shine to me.

377
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,167
What's that mean?

378
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,127
It means he asked

379
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,127
me out to dinner.

380
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,295
No big deal.

381
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,796
So, you going?

382
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,716
When have you known me

383
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,716
to turn down a free meal?

384
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,884
Ain't that the truth.

385
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,429
Says the Pillsbury Doughboy.

386
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,847
Ain't that the truth.

387
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,267
(Mary and Meemaw chuckling)

388
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,893
I do have feelings, y'all.

389
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,110
Don't put on too much of that.

390
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,778
We want him to like you

391
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,778
for your mind.

392
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,614
I think I know what I'm doing

393
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,614
when it comes to men.

394
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,200
If that's true,

395
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,200
then why do you live alone?

396
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:20,370
Because my husband died.

397
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:20,370
Any other questions?

398
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:22,956
(doorbell rings)

399
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:22,956
He's here!

400
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,165
I'll get it.

401
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,669
Maybe that is a bit much.

402
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,882
Hello, Dr. Sturgis.

403
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,882
Hello, Sheldon.

404
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:36,094
Come in. Meemaw's upstairs

405
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:36,094
getting ready for your date.

406
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,638
Wonderful.

407
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,559
Oh, my, this is a lovely house.

408
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:45,228
Isn't it? Can you see

409
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:45,228
yourself living here?

410
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,687
I can.

411
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,651
Here are some things you might

412
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,651
find helpful about Meemaw.

413
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,027
Her favorite color

414
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,027
is purple,

415
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,988
her favorite ice cream:

416
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,988
mint chip,

417
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,823
and her favorite food

418
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,823
is Mexican.

419
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,658
Excellent.

420
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,658
Good to know.

421
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,369
She loves gambling, bowling,

422
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,369
and especially me.

423
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,121
You can't talk enough

424
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,121
about me.

425
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,872
Tell me more about you.

426
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,501
My favorite color is blue.

427
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,501
Mine, too.

428
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,128
My favorite ice cream: vanilla.

429
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,128
Good man.

430
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,755
My favorite food: spaghetti

431
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,755
with hot dogs cut up in it.

432
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,132
I've never had that.

433
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,217
What's your favorite food?

434
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,217
Grilled cheese.

435
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,718
What about the risk

436
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,718
of mouth burn?

437
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,182
It's a perfect excuse

438
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,182
for vanilla ice cream.

439
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,435
If you want to propose tonight,

440
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,435
you have my blessing.

441
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,104
Hello, boys.

442
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,898
Hello, Connie.

443
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,898
(chuckles)

444
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,151
These are for you.

445
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,278
Aw, thank you.

446
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,278
They're beautiful.

447
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,238
Some of them are purple.

448
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,325
So they are.

449
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,285
I should probably get 'em

450
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,285
into some water.

451
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,411
I can do that.

452
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,871
You two begin

453
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,871
your courtship.

454
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,331
Moonpie.

455
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,331
Yes?

456
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,582
Go home.

457
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,084
So you can begin

458
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,084
the courtship, got it.

459
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,294
Go!

460
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,129
Dr. Sturgis,

461
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,465
I just want you to know

462
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,465
I couldn't be more pleased.

463
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,219
(chuckles)

464
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,680
(chuckles)

465
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,680
Well, let me

466
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,680
take care of these,

467
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,223
and then we'll head out.

468
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,224
I just need to

469
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,685
borrow your phone to call a cab.

470
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:07,935
Why?

471
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,437
I don't drive.

472
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,856
Well, how did you get here?

473
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,983
I rode my bicycle.

474
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,194
You rode your bicycle?

475
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,572
I have a Schwinn Speedster.

476
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:22,783
It's got three gears.

477
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:22,783
I only use one.

478
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:26,454
I tell you what, how

479
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:26,454
about we take my car?

480
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,746
Excellent.

481
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,915
So, would you be opposed

482
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:32,126
to me sitting in the back seat?

483
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,088
It's statistically

484
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,088
the safest part of the car.

485
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,174
Actually, I would.

486
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,843
Asked and answered.

487
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,512
(both laugh)

488
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,268
(knock on door)

489
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,820
MISSY: Did you cry

490
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,820
when you saw it?

491
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:00,863
No.

492
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,031
MISSY:

493
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,031
Why not?

494
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,782
'Cause it ain't

495
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,782
that big a deal.

496
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,660
MISSY:

497
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,660
Okay.

498
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,416
Did you hang it

499
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,416
on your wall?

500
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,626
Get out of here!

501
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,462
MISSY:

502
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,462
I'm telling people you cried.

503
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,505
Do you like guacamole?

504
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,923
I don't know.

505
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:22,093
Being from Maine, we didn't have

506
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:22,093
much Mexican food.

507
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,846
Or Mexican people.

508
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,846
Or people.

509
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,182
It's just mashed up avocados.

510
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,182
I think you'd like it.

511
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,101
And they do it right

512
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,101
here at the table.

513
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,479
Did they run out of room

514
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,479
in the kitchen?

515
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,065
No, it's-it's like,

516
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,065
you know, a show.

517
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,109
Like Benihana.

518
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,109
Exactly.

519
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,027
I don't like Benihana.

520
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,739
Let's skip the guacamole.

521
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,739
No, no.

522
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,991
You like it,

523
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,991
and I want this date

524
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,577
to be appealing to you,

525
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,577
so let's order it.

526
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,746
Okay.

527
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,290
I might enjoy it.

528
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,290
I might not.

529
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,752
But, uh, I'm willing

530
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,752
to take that gamble.

531
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,171
Which, uh,

532
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,171
I'm given to understand

533
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,007
you also like.

534
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,594
Oh, that little rat just

535
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,594
told you everything, didn't he?

536
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:09,056
Don't feel bad, I enjoy

537
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:09,056
a little gambling now and then.

538
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,725
Do you?

539
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,851
I sat in your front seat,

540
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,851
didn't I?

541
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,979
(laughs)

542
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,273
Good, I made you laugh.

543
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,318
Full disclosure,

544
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,318
I wasn't trying to be funny.

545
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,987
(laughs loudly)

546
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,114
Still not trying.

547
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,991
(continues laughing)

548
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,955
They're not gonna

549
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,955
be back for a while.

550
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,708
Go to bed.

551
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,084
I won't be able to sleep.

552
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,336
I'm not telling you

553
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,336
to go to sleep,

554
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,671
I'm telling you to go to bed.

555
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,130
You don't think

556
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,965
they'll have relations tonight,

557
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,965
do you?

558
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,718
Now I'm telling you

559
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,718
to go to sleep.

560
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,595
So, John, you ever

561
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,595
been married?

562
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,138
No.

563
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,138
Hmm.

564
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,890
Ever been in love?

565
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,851
Seven times.

566
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,185
Seven times?

567
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,978
How come you never

568
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,978
settled down?

569
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,315
Well, my feelings

570
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,315
were not reciprocated.

571
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,401
Well, that's so sad.

572
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,652
Not for them.

573
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,945
They all seemed pleased

574
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,945
with the outcome.

575
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,989
Especially number four.

576
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,534
She said she

577
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,534
dodged a bullet.

578
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:13,204
That is a very brave thing

579
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:13,204
to say on a first date.

580
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,539
Why?

581
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,208
If there's a second date,

582
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,208
I'll tell you.

583
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,253
I have a chance

584
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,253
at a second date?

585
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,463
This is going very well.

586
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,633
Try the guacamole.

587
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,887
No, no, no.

588
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,887
With a chip.

589
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,804
Oh.

590
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,682
(laughs)

591
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,682
Okay.

592
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,727
Like this.

593
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,813
There you go.

594
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,231
Mmm!

595
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,024
(chuckling)

596
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,694
Now, how do

597
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,694
chimichangas work?

598
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,696
I have no idea.

599
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,657
Well, I think we should try

600
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,657
and find out.

601
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,370
How'd it go?

602
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,790
Oh! What the hell?

603
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,583
I wanted to know

604
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,583
how your date went,

605
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,418
and I got bored

606
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,418
watching you sleep.

607
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,670
How long have you been there?

608
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,422
67 minutes.

609
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,006
Now, tell me everything.

610
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,468
Go away.

611
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,468
Let me sleep.

612
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,677
Okay.

613
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,970
But before I go,

614
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,970
should I be worried

615
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,138
he's not in your bed?

616
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,181
Get out!

617
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,726
I certainly hope

618
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,726
you were nicer to him.

619
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,478
MEEMAW:

620
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,478
Out!

621
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,730
So, are you gonna

622
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,730
see him again?

623
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,023
I don't know.

624
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,401
He showed up at my

625
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,401
house on a bike.

626
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:26,778
Like a Harley?

627
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,404
Like a Schwinn.

628
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,072
You mean a<i> bike</i> bike?

629
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,075
With a jingle bell on the

630
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,075
handlebar and everything.

631
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,994
Well, that's kind of charming.

632
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,913
He doesn't know how

633
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,913
to drive a car.

634
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,080
Doesn't want to know.

635
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,333
Okay, a little

636
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,333
less charming.

637
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,876
There's something about him.

638
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:45,839
I mean, he's smart as hell,

639
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:45,839
and gentle and funny.

640
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,842
Not always on purpose,

641
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,842
but he's funny.

642
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:52,136
I never met anybody

643
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:52,136
like him.

644
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,972
Sounds like Sheldon.

645
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,556
Now, why would you go

646
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,767
and put that thought

647
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,767
in my mind?

648
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,144
Well, I think you should

649
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,521
give him another try.

650
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,314
I agree with Mom.

651
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,397
Sheldon!

652
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,449
Oh, no.

653
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,172
Aw.

654
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,592
STURGIS:

655
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,592
So, now we can discuss

656
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:36,222
what the perturbative QCD

657
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:36,222
corrections to R-bar look like.

658
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,975
So, you can also

659
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,975
write it as "R"

660
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:40,685
divided by the length of "R."

661
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,313
That would be a vector

662
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,982
of unit length...

663
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,194
...parallel...

664
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,155
to "R."

665
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,993
I'm sorry, where was I?

666
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,452
"R" divided by

667
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,452
the length of "R."

668
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,620
That would be a vector

669
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,330
of unit length

670
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,330
parallel to "R."

671
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,541
Oh, yes. Thank you.

672
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:08,546
So, if you divide "R"

673
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:08,546
by the length of "R,"

674
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:12,550
that would be a vector...

675
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,469
of unit length parallel...

676
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,222
to...

677
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,059
I think you need to leave.

678
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,482
So...

679
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,859
when we divide "R"

680
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,360
by the length of "R,"

681
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,739
that would be a vector

682
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,739
of unit length

683
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:38,409
parallel to "R."

684
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,580
(indistinct chatter)

685
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,290
Sir, bad news.

686
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,250
Don't tell me.

687
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,250
There's another problem

688
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,002
we're not smart

689
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,002
enough to solve?

690
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,630
It's the satellite-- the liquid

691
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,630
helium is boiling off.

692
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,381
Well, why the heck

693
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,381
would that happen?

694
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,842
SHELDON:

695
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,842
I'll tell you why.

696
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,844
The sun must be glinting off

697
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,844
the solar panel

698
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,137
and hitting the dewar.

699
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,388
Why didn't you know that?

700
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,348
I'm a disappointment, sir.

701
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,976
We need to calculate

702
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,976
all the Euler angles

703
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,144
that would cause the sun

704
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,144
to hit the liquid helium.

705
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,646
Can you do it in time?

706
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,189
I can with my new friend,

707
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,189
Dr. John Sturgis.

708
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,608
Hello.

709
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,192
(man coughs)

710
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,736
Hi.

711
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,446
He's gonna marry

712
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,446
my meemaw.

713
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,907
I bought her a bicycle.

714
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:19,867
A<i> purple</i> bicycle.

715
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,870
Purple?

716
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,870
Sounds like love to me.

717
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,373
(gasps)

718
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,250
Mr. Cooper?!

719
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,294
Huh?

720
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,545
Are you paying attention?

721
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,380
I already know this.

722
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,466
You know this?

723
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,427
But they don't,

724
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,427
so by all means, continue.

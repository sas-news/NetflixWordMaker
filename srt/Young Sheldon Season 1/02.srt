So to be clear, you're<i> not</i>

388
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:05,439
interested in making friends?

389
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,067
What I'm interested in

390
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,067
is in living long enough

391
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:13,196
to see women no longer treated

392
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:13,196
like second-class citizens.

393
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,906
Well if your goal

394
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,906
is a long life,

395
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,867
that chili cheeseburger is

396
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,867
a step in the wrong direction.

397
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,661
Food is all I have.

398
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,663
ADULT SHELDON:

399
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,663
<i>Like I said,</i>

400
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,041
<i>emotionally troubled adults.</i>

401
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,043
You gonna watch me eat?

402
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,795
Get out of here.

403
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,799
MAN:

404
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,799
<i>Everybody told me,</i>

405
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,884
"Hubert, don't date

406
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,884
someone from work."

407
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,095
But did I listen? No.

408
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,846
Let me tell you something.

409
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,846
She likes to say

410
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,265
I stole<i> her</i> innocence?

411
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,724
Well, what about<i> my</i> innocence?

412
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,934
I was never the same

413
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,934
after we broke up.

414
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,561
ADULT SHELDON:

415
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,561
<i>Two years later,</i>

416
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,729
<i>Mr. Givens became</i>

417
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,729
<i>the high school principal,</i>

418
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,941
<i>which might be why Ms. MacElroy</i>

419
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,941
<i>became morbidly obese.</i>

420
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,569
I had the brains, I had the

421
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,569
charm, and I don't like to brag,

422
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,529
but I was pretty easy

423
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,529
on the eyes back then.

424
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,531
That woman got herself

425
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,531
one heck of a package.

426
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,617
But some people don't

427
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,617
want to be satisfied.

428
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,078
Is that any good?

429
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,580
I'm afraid not.

430
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,873
I failed to make

431
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,873
a single friend.

432
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,709
That sucks. I have a tough time

433
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,709
making friends, too.

434
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,463
The worst part is, it

435
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,463
was important to my mom.

436
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:14,174
My parents pressure me about

437
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:14,174
making friends all the time.

438
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,344
So you understand

439
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,344
what I'm going through.

440
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,180
Oh, I read that book.

441
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,180
It's excellent.

442
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,515
Are you into rocketry?

443
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,975
I started with

444
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,975
water propulsion,

445
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,768
worked my way up

446
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,768
to solid fuel,

447
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,480
then went back to water after

448
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,480
I set our garage on fire.

449
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:31,274
Nice.

450
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:31,274
I also tried to

451
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:31,274
get some uranium

452
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,902
and build an atomic engine,

453
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,902
but that stuff's hard to find.

454
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,696
Probably for the best.

455
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,949
Well, good luck on your

456
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,949
quest to find a friend.

457
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,369
You, too.

458
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:50,793
If you haven't found one

459
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:50,793
yet, I have good news.

460
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,965
Mom, what do you know

461
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,965
about the drug Prozac?

462
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,384
Not much.

463
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,011
Supposed to make

464
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,011
people happier. Why?

465
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,596
I was just thinking

466
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,682
some of my teachers

467
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,682
might benefit from it.

468
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:06,267
Speaking of which,

469
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,186
you'll be happy to know

470
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,186
I made a friend today.

471
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,438
Oh.

472
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,357
Well, that's nice.

473
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,568
But, as I said,

474
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,568
this isn't for me.

475
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,278
It's for you.

476
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,488
He made a friend!

477
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,156
He did it!

478
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,492
Our little boy has got a friend.

479
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,244
Who is it?

480
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,244
Who cares?

481
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,496
It's a human being.

482
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,496
It's a warm body.

483
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,122
(knocks)

484
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,122
SHELDON: Mom?

485
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,249
Yes, honey?

486
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,167
Can I come in?

487
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,167
Of course.

488
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,628
Be cool.

489
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,422
What's up, sweetie?

490
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,422
I was wondering

491
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,882
when I could continue

492
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,882
my rocketry hobby.

493
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,884
Uh, Sheldon,

494
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,884
we've been through this.

495
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,136
You can build them.

496
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,136
You just can't launch them.

497
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,930
But launching them

498
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,930
is the fun part.

499
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,223
Tell that to the family

500
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,223
of squirrels

501
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,850
who died in the fire.

502
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,850
Okay.

503
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,186
It was just something I was

504
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,186
hoping to do with my new friend.

505
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,479
Hang on.

506
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,855
Uh, yes.

507
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:53,898
It's fine.

508
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,108
Ban is lifted.

509
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,401
Mary...

510
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,401
It's for his friend.

511
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,403
He's got a friend.

512
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,779
Besides,

513
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,779
those could have been rats.

514
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,365
Their bodies

515
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,365
were so badly burned.

516
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,410
I thought we were being cool,

517
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,410
but okay.

518
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,161
Hey, here's an idea.

519
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,664
Why don't you invite your

520
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,664
new buddy over for dinner?

521
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,040
Why?

522
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,040
Well, honey,

523
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:14,628
um, that is what friends do.

524
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,379
My mother asked

525
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,379
me to ask you

526
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,256
if you'd like to

527
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,256
join us for dinner.

528
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,926
Why?

529
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,926
I was hoping you'd know.

530
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,891
MARY:

531
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,891
He's here!

532
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,728
Everybody, stay calm!

533
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,728
Just a normal day,

534
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,105
just a normal dinner.

535
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,105
MISSY:

536
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,105
Can I eat in front of the TV?

537
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,733
MARY: No, you can eat

538
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,733
in front of Sheldon's friend.

539
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,401
MISSY: Aw, fudge.

540
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,401
I know what "fudge" means,

541
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,612
and you are right

542
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,612
on the edge, young lady.

543
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,531
Welcome.

544
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,874
GEORGE SR.:

545
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,874
So, uh...

546
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,960
Tam. What kind of name is that?

547
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,587
Vietnamese. Sir.

548
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,922
Sure. You know, I spent

549
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,922
a little time over there.

550
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,133
Army.

551
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,095
Your mom's name isn't

552
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,095
Kim-Lee, is it?

553
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,597
No. Sir.

554
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,140
Good.

555
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,976
I mean, you know,

556
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,976
it's a small country.

557
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,478
(chuckles):

558
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,478
So...

559
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,021
Mary, how's that food coming?

560
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,105
MARY:

561
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,105
Almost.

562
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,358
So, Vietnam, like in<i> Rambo.</i>

563
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,485
Yes.

564
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,485
That's a cool movie.

565
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,444
Yes.

566
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,529
Are you in it?

567
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,656
No.

568
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,656
Hmm.

569
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,701
Why would you think

570
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,701
you knew his mom?

571
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,661
MARY:

572
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,661
All right, Tam.

573
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,455
I decided I was gonna make

574
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,455
you a real Texas dinner.

575
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,207
Barbecued chicken and brisket.

576
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,542
Thank you.

577
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,917
Well, I figured

578
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,917
you were probably tired

579
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,753
of stuff wiggling around

580
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,753
on your plate.

581
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,339
Okay, let's say grace.

582
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,716
Now, Tam, when I say "Jesus,"

583
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,718
feel free to say the word

584
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,718
"Buddha" in your head.

585
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,926
I'm actually Catholic.

586
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,680
Oh. Well, that's too bad.

587
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,181
Thank you, God,

588
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,181
for this food,

589
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,809
and bless the hands

590
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,809
that prepared it.

591
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,061
And thank you so much

592
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,061
for Sheldon's new friend.

593
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,480
ALL:

594
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,480
Amen.

595
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,107
So, Tam, tell us

596
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,107
about your family.

597
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,026
What brings y'all to Texas?

598
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,986
Well, after the American War...

599
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,154
You mean the Vietnam War.

600
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,656
We call it the American War.

601
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,199
Hmm.

602
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,199
Anyway,

603
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,659
after the war, my

604
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,659
father was sent

605
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,077
to a reeducation camp

606
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,412
because he fought

607
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,412
on the wrong side.

608
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,538
You mean our side.

609
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,165
I was trying to be nice.

610
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,250
So, for many years,

611
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,001
my mother and my

612
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,001
sisters and I

613
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,754
were very poor

614
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,339
and very often

615
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,339
didn't have much to eat.

616
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,592
Then, when he was released...

617
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,510
What'd they teach him

618
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,510
at the reeducation camp?

619
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,762
How to be a communist.

620
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,722
Cool, like in<i> Rambo.</i>

621
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:31,890
(chuckles nervously)

622
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,057
When he was released,

623
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,975
we escaped on a small boat

624
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:38,563
and spent many weeks at sea

625
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:38,563
dodging Cambodian pirates

626
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,189
until we reached Thailand.

627
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:43,067
Oh, that's supposed to be

628
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:43,067
a beautiful country.

629
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,570
Lovely beaches.

630
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,570
TAM:

631
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,570
I wouldn't know.

632
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,781
We were forced to live

633
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,781
in a refugee camp,

634
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:51,033
where the only thing we had

635
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:51,033
to eat were pigeons and rats.

636
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,453
Ha! That's a job for hot sauce.

637
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,330
Finally,

638
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,207
we were allowed

639
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,207
to come to United States

640
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,793
and start over in Galveston.

641
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,712
My father saved money

642
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,712
and bought his own shrimp boat.

643
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,465
There's a happy ending. Huh?

644
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,592
See, kids?

645
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,592
When the going gets tough,

646
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,969
America provides.

647
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,969
TAM:

648
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,969
It did.

649
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,555
Until the Ku Klux Klan

650
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,555
burned our boat

651
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,390
and chased us away.

652
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,893
You gonna put a good spin

653
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,893
on that one?

654
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:19,103
So we came to Medford

655
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,772
and opened up

656
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,772
a convenience store.

657
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,190
My parents work 16 hours a day,

658
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,901
seven days a week

659
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,361
for very little money.

660
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,619
Well, that was depressing.

661
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,751
I don't understand

662
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,751
why it didn't launch.

663
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,169
Me, neither.

664
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,130
Evil Nazi scientists

665
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,130
did it 50 years ago.

666
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,757
How hard could it be?

667
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,008
(doorbell rings)

668
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,930
Can I help you?

669
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,432
Sorry to bother you, ma'am. FBI.

670
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,476
We're looking

671
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,476
for a Sheldon Lee Cooper.

672
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,394
George!

673
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,646
GEORGE SR.:

674
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,646
I'm on the can.

675
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:04,022
Now!

676
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:04,022
(door opens)

677
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,233
What?

678
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,233
These gentlemen

679
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,779
are with the FBI.

680
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,779
They want to talk to Sheldon.

681
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,446
What?

682
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,073
We... Uh...

683
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,659
Y-You fellas

684
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,659
must have made a mistake.

685
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,160
Sheldon's nine.

686
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,662
Well, someone living

687
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,662
at this address

688
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,039
recently called a mining

689
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,039
operation in Canada

690
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,207
and tried to buy uranium.

691
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,751
Okay, maybe it's not a mistake.

692
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,169
It's ridiculous.

693
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,295
Let's just go talk to him.

694
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,714
Huh?

695
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,089
He's just a little,

696
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,089
itty-bitty thing.

697
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,383
Really, he's harmless.

698
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,221
SHELDON:

699
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,221
Sorry!

700
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,891
He's in the garage.

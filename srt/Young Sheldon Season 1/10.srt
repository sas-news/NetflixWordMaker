1
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,711
First off, I want to

2
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,711
thank you both for coming.

3
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:05,255
Yeah, yeah, what'd he do?

4
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:07,257
Uh, he didn't do anything.

5
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,969
Gosh, Tom,

6
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,969
I want to believe you.

7
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,138
Okay, the problem is,

8
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,138
the curriculum here

9
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,890
is not challenging enough

10
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,890
for Sheldon.

11
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,642
Now, he gets bored

12
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:19,728
and maybe doesn't

13
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:19,728
express himself

14
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,689
in the most productive way.

15
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,318
And so the square of sine

16
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,318
plus cosine equals one.

17
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,862
Sheldon.

18
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,446
I don't want to embarrass you,

19
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,031
so I'm going

20
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,031
to give you a moment

21
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,074
to think about

22
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,074
what you just said.

23
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,494
Ms. MacElroy.

24
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,287
What?

25
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,331
I'm wondering if you read

26
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,331
the book you assigned to us,

27
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,499
because I did.

28
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,876
WILKINS:

00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,876
<i>20 laps.</i>

30
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,798
Cooper.

31
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,174
If you're going

32
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,174
to ask us to run,

33
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,593
don't you think you should

34
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,593
lead by example?

35
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,307
So you're saying he's being rude

36
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,307
to his teachers?

37
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,810
That's unacceptable.

38
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,810
I'll-I'll give him a talkin' to.

39
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,562
I don't know

40
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,562
if I'd call him rude.

41
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,855
Well, put a word on it.

42
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:05,147
Rude, let's go with rude.

43
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,441
Rude is good.

44
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,485
So what do you want us to do?

45
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:11,446
I want you to consider another

46
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:11,446
approach to his education.

47
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,198
Okay.

48
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,198
What does that mean?

49
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,200
I recently had a nice chat

50
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,200
with the head

51
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,327
of Wilmot Academy

52
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,327
for Gifted Children.

53
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,372
Now, I told her all about

54
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,372
Sheldon, and she seemed to think

55
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,918
he would be a perfect fit

56
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,918
over there.

57
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,168
MARY: We already looked

58
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,168
into private school.

59
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,670
We can't afford it.

60
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:29,464
Not unless you're

61
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:29,464
giving me a raise.

62
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:29,464
I'm not.

63
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,383
Okay, just checking.

64
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,053
But I can tell you this.

65
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,554
Wilmot has been known

66
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,347
to give children like Sheldon

67
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,347
full scholarship.

68
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:38,473
Take a look at that.

69
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,935
My goodness.

70
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,935
No kidding.

71
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,143
Yeah, just read up on it.

72
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,478
Give it some thought.

73
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,522
MARY:

74
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,522
Hold on.

75
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,609
This place is in Dallas;

76
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,609
that's three hours away.

77
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,070
Well, yeah, but, uh,

78
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,446
what they do

79
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,446
in cases like yours,

80
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,822
they look for a local family

81
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:56,033
for him to live with.

82
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:56,033
And, George, Dallas?

83
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:57,910
Dallas is certainly close enough

84
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:59,703
that he can come home

85
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:59,703
on the weekends.

86
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,415
Look, we appreciate

87
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,500
you going to bat for him,

88
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,500
but he's just

89
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,835
a wee little thing.

90
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,252
We can't ship him off to Dallas.

91
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,755
Shouldn't we talk

92
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,755
about this first?

93
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,424
What's there to talk about,

94
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,424
George?

95
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,217
This could be a great

96
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,217
opportunity for Sheldon.

97
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,803
He's nine years old.

98
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,013
Oh, come on, you can't measure

99
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,013
him in Earth years.

100
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,974
You're saying he's an alien?

101
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,391
PETERSEN:

102
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,391
Well, in George's defense,

103
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,269
that idea has been

104
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,269
tossed around...

105
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,437
a little bit.

106
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,188
That's a bad joke.

107
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,067
Look, I understand

108
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,067
this is a big decision.

109
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:33,028
If you change your mind,

110
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:33,028
give me a call.

111
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,989
I'd be more than happy

112
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,989
to set up an interview.

113
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,824
Uh, yeah. Thank you.

114
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,824
You bet.

115
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,075
Thank you.

116
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:40,494
Mm-hmm.

131

I know where Dallas is.

132
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,617
I used to buy

133
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,617
my marijuana there.

134

I said "used to."

with this one

138
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,498
and all the fun stopped.

139
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,501
All I am saying is that

140
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,253
this would be a great

141
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,253
opportunity for Sheldon.

00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,922
I know, you're right.

143
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,632
Whoa, she's right?

144
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,509
I said the same thing

145
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,509
in Petersen's office,

146
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,094
you looked at me

147
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,094
like I was an idiot.

148
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,221
Yeah, that's the look.

149
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,682
Maybe y'all are being a

150
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,682
little selfish about this.

151
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,934
Selfish? We're thinking of him.

152
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,644
Well, that's all

153
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,644
well and good,

154
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,438
but maybe you should be

155
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,438
thinking about the whole world.

156
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,232
I mean,

157
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,484
what if Einstein's parents

158
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,484
had held him back?

159
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,277
We wouldn't even have the...

160
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,072
Well, I was gonna

161
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,072
say atomic bomb,

162
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,115
but there's probably

163
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,115
a better example.

164
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,408
Here's a crazy idea:

165
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,409
how about we ask Sheldon

166
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,702
what he thinks of all this?

167
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,621
Go ahead, but he's not gonna

168
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,621
want to go.

169
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,249
This is his home,

170
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,249
we're his family.

171
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,460
Sheldon, can you come in here

172
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,460
for a minute?!

173
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,005
Yes?

174
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:17,464
Have a seat.

175
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:17,464
We want to talk to you.

176
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:17,464
All right.

177
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,222
So, today we found out

178
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,222
about a school in Dallas

179
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,472
for really smart kids.

180
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,807
When can I start?

181
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,310
Hold on. Dallas is far away,

182
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,688
so you'd have to live

183
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,688
with another family.

184
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,148
Do they have a dog?

185
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,817
Uh, we don't know.

186
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,527
Well, can you make some calls?

187
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:42,032
I guess, but wouldn't you miss

188
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:42,032
your mom and dad?

189
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,867
Oh.

190
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,120
Yes, I suppose I will.

191
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,125
So, when are you calling

192
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,125
about the dog?

193
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,420
You know him so well.

What are you

199
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,944
They're so quiet.

200
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,612
Are they on medication?

201
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,864
No, they're just

202
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,864
smart like you.

203
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,867
I've been going to school

204
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,867

these uniforms.

207
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,497
Kinda froufrou.

208
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,374
Sheldon, I've been looking over

209
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,374
your transcripts

210
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,627

00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,462
Thank you.

221
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,059
That's not nice.

222
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,269
I wasn't trying for nice.

a professional male model.

232
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,115
That is hilarious.

What? I'm good-lookin'.

234
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,995
No, that you think you'll

235
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,995
graduate high school.

236

The model thing

237
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,332

Well, that's real nice

246

to hear.

247
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,925
Now, listen to this:

"Putting aside his

That doesn't sound like me

257
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,854
at all.

258
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,105
Sure it does, sweetie.

Dr. Douglas...

260
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,025
Oh, no. Please call me Flora.

261
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,486
Flora, I have to ask about

262
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,486
the living arrangements.

263
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,239
That's our main concern.

264
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,115
Well, I think I can

265
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,115
reassure you about that.

266
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,117
My husband and I have been

267
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,117

268
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,286
for the last several years

269
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,286
who recently graduated

270
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,787
and is now at Princeton.

271
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,375
So we have a guest room

272
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,375
available in our home.

273
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,417
That's very generous of you.

274
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,419
Does your husband work

275
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,419
at the school also?

276
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,796
No, he's retired.

277
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,840
He was an astrophysicist

278
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,840
for NASA.

279
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,800
Please tell me

280
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,800
you don't have a dog.

00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,594
No. We're both allergic.

293
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,490
This necklace has been

in our family

295
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,492
for generations.

296
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,621
It belonged

297
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,621
to a Comanche warrior

298
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,624
who gave it to your

299

great-great-great-great grandma.

300
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,917
Why'd he give it to her?

301
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,628
Well, according

302
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,628
to family lore,

303
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,548
she was, uh, a very

304
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,548
accommodating young lady

305
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,634
and, uh, they hit it off.

306
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,094
That's a bird feather.

307
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,138
Eagle feather.

308
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,138
Doesn't matter.

309
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,432
I don't like birds;

310
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,432
birds are filthy.

311
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,849
Okay.

312
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,936
Fine.

313
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,854
One featherless

314
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,854
family heirloom

315
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,482
for you to take with you and

316
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,482
keep you safe while you're away.

317
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:06,027

Oh, for God's sake,

334
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,268

to deal with this

336
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,145

339
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,691

341
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:48,028
I'm still not sure that this

342
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:48,028
is the right thing to do.

343
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,571

344
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,571

345

390
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,654
No.

391
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,408
To me, you're like string beans.

392
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,534
No one asks

393
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,534
for them,

394
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,494
no one wonders about them.

395
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,246
They're just there on the plate.

396
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,498
But you eat them, right?

397
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,166
Yes.

398
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,128
You're gonna miss me.

399
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,771
(sighs) All right,

400
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,771
let's say grace.

401
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,149
(sniffles) Guess I get

402
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,149
to hold hands with you now.

403
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,735
Guess so.

404
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,863
Maybe Sheldon's mittens

405
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,863
weren't such a bad idea.

406
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,033
Thank you, God, for

407
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,033
this food we are about

408
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,660
to receive

409
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,660
and for the nourishment

410
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,911
of our bodies.

411
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,911
And bless

412
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,497
the hands that

413
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,497
prepared it.

414
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:07,667
And, God, we ask that you watch

415
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:07,667
over our Sheldon...

416
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,087
as he begins

417
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,087
this wonderful new... (grunts)

418
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,547
(clears throat)

419
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,842
(exhales)

420
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,842
...as he begins

421
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,094
this wonderful new chapter

422
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,094
in his life.

423
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,222
Amen.

424
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,222
Amen.

425
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,222
Mm.

426
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,807
Why you cryin'?

427
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,309
Why you stupid?

428
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,769
So how'd it go in Dallas today?

429
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,062
GEORGE SR.:

430
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,062
Went fine.

431
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,272
Nice people.

432
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,357
Sheldon seemed very comfortable

433
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,483
with the whole thing.

434
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,028
Welcome! How was the drive?

435
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,823
Eh, a little traffic comin' into

436
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,823
the city but otherwise okay.

437
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,742
Sheldon, I want you to

438
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,742
meet my husband, Elliot.

439
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,745
Elliot, this

440
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,745
is Sheldon.

441
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,498
Well, it's nice to

442
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,498
meet you, young man.

443
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,041
I've heard a lot about you.

444
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,835
MARY:<i> George, that is</i>

445
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,835
<i>not at all how they were.</i>

446
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,253
What are you talking about?

447
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,253
There was

448
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,381
definitely something

449
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,381
off about those people.

450
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,965
Really?

451
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,716
What'd I miss?

452
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,511
Welcome!

453
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,305
How was the drive?

454
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:06,767
Eh, a little traffic comin' into

455
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:06,767
the city but otherwise okay.

456
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,186
(creaking)

457
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,186
Sheldon,

458
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:12,315
I want you to meet

459
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:12,315
my husband, Elliot.

460
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,694
Elliot, this

461
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,694
is Sheldon.

462
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,613
Nice to meet

463
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,613
you, young man.

464
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,824
I've heard a lot about you.

465
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,118
(cackling)

466
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,413
(Flora cackling)

467
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,413
GEORGE SR.:<i> Oh, come on.</i>

468
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,707
You're making it out like

469
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,707
they were some kind of monsters.

470
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,417
Sheldon has

471
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,417
his own room.

472
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,959
There's books

473
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,959
everywhere.

474
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,379
Even has a big old backyard

475
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,379
he won't play in.

476
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,172
Aren't you forgetting

477
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,172
somethin'?

478
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,298
What?

479
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,175
The underground laboratory.

480
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,552
GEORGE SR.:

481
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,552
I think it's called

482
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,470
a finished basement, honey.

483
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,013
I know what I saw.

484
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,640
Mary, it's been a long day.

485
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,183
Can we just have a quiet dinner?

486
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,644
Sure.

487
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,398
(quietly):

488
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,398
"Nice people."

489
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,900
Then why did we leave him there?

490
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:59,446
Because we love him and

491
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:59,446
we want the best for him.

492
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:09,205
This is tense.

493
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,665
Me and the kids

494
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:11,874
had a nice day.

495
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,834
Watched a lot of football.

496
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,045
You know, the Dolphins' helmet

497
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,045
has a dolphin on it.

498
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,838
And that dolphin

499
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,838
is also wearing a helmet.

500
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,840
But his helmet doesn't have

501
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,840
a dolphin on it--

502
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,635
it has the letter "M."

503
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:26,097
We talked about that

504
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:26,097
for an hour.

505
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,392
All right.

506
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,478
Dig in.

507
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,772
Excuse me.

508
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,482
Aren't we going to say grace?

509
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,401
Uh, we don't do that

510
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,401
in our house.

511
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,487
Oh.

512
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,280
But you're welcome to do so.

513
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,616
That's all right.

514
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,616
I don't believe in God.

515
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,909
Well, then why would you say

516
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,909
grace?

517
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,245
Because it makes my mom happy.

518
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,164
And why are you wearing

519
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,164
mittens?

520
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,916
Well, I don't know

521
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,916
where your hands have been.

522
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,336
Okay.

523
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,254
Maybe we should just eat.

524
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,381
(chuckles)

525
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,178
Do you like string beans?

526
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,139
No.

527
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,141
But I eat them.

528
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,478
(Flora chuckles)

529
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,439
♪ ♪

530
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,572
Sheldon, can you hear me?

531
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,492
It's your twin sister, Missy.

532
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,327
Everything's all right here,

533
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,664
but I think

534
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,664
Mom misses you real bad.

535
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,669
(sighs)

536
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,669
All right, I can't hear you,

537
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,379
so I'm gonna hang up now.

538
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,506
Good night.

539
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,926
MARY: I'm telling you,

540
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,926
this is a terrible idea.

541
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,388
This is a terrible,

542
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,388
terrible idea.

543
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,388
MEEMAW: He's gonna be fine.

544
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,515
You'll see.

545
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,515
MARY: I can't believe

546
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,515
you're okay with this.

547
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:51,932
MEEMAW:

548
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:51,932
I'm not okay with this.

549
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,018
I'm just trying

550
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,018
to be strong for you!

551
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,979
What? You thought him

552
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,979
leaving was a good idea.

553
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,399
Oh, I only said that because

554
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,399
you thought it was a bad idea.

555
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,942
You know how it's always

556
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,942
my nature to go the other way.

557
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,027
Say "up."

558
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,237
Up.

559
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,530
Down.

560
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,783
I'll see you in a bit.

561
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,201
Where are you off to?

562
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,619
I'm going to Dallas

563
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,619
to get Sheldon.

564
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,329
Really?

565
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,329
Yeah, really.

566
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,874
What about this being

567
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,874
a great opportunity for him?

568
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,500
Y'all want me to go or not?

569
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,168
Yes! Go!

570
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,168
Yes, and hurry up!

571
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,837
MEEMAW:

572
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,837
Get a move on, Tubby.

573
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,213
Where you going?

574
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,464
To get Sheldon.

575
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,507
Do I get a vote in this?

576
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,800
No.

577
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,635
Dang.

578
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,846
ADULT SHELDON:<i> Sleep</i>

579
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,846

00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,851

What?

Never mind. You do it your way.

No, no.

You tell me.

Tell me how I'm wrong.

638
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,806
You assumed an extra axiom

639
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,806
of Euclidean geometry

00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,307

I send him on little errands.

649
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,903
Like the other day, I told him,

650
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,906
"Go to the supply room

651
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,906

What's a framastan?

654
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,283
No such thing. I made it up.

00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,957
That's genius.

659
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,500
I'm using that.

660
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,753
Don't use framastan.

661
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,753
That's mine.

664

You said he was going away.

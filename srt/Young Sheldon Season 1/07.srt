Oh...

389
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,637
Rest, my darling.

390
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,263
Rest.

391
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:06,309
Mmm. This Café Du Monde coffee

392
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:06,309
is very good.

393
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,019
They make it with chicory.

394
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,689
And what does it do

395
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,689
to the brisket?

396
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,148
Oh, I have no idea.

397
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,108
Then...

398
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,944
why did you send George

399
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,944
all the way to New Orleans?

400
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,489
Well, they don't sell this

401
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,489
around here.

402
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,657
Mmm.

403
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,159
Here we go.

404
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,496
15 years and 14 hours later.

405
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:29,165
Best brisket in Texas.

406
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,923
GEORGE SR.:

407
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,923
Connie, you evil bitch!

408
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,342
It's smoother

409
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,342
than regular coffee.

410
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,636
That wasn't the recipe.

411
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,888
You looked me in the eye,

412
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,888
and you lied to me.

413
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,265
Oh, Mom.

414
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,684
You broke into my home

415
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,684
and tried to steal it.

416
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:48,809
Oh, George.

417
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,977
You told her we

418
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,977
went over there?

419
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,812
(gasps)

420
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,812
Oh, George Jr.

421
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,814
I didn't say nothing.

422
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,814
I was cool.

423
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,734
I am loving this.

424
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,736
I don't want this woman

425
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,736
in my house anymore.

426
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,446
She is my mother.

427
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,446
She is the devil.

428
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,489
And what if the kids

429
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,489
want to see her?

430
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,450
Fine.

431
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,410
Schedule it

432
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,410
for when I'm not here.

433
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,537
Or when I'm dead.

434
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,088
And quit drinking my coffee.

435
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:28,807
Turn off your train,

436
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:28,807
we've got to talk.

437
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,935
(train stops)

438
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,935
About what?

439
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,646
Mom is so upset

440
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,646
about Dad and Meemaw,

441
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,105
she might want a divorce.

442
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,898
No one's getting divorced.

443
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,024
How do you know?

444
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,485
(whistles)

445
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,236
Great, now I have

446
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,236
to throw that out.

447
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,990
Mother-in-laws are always held

448
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,990
in low regard by the father.

449
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,701
It rarely leads

450
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,701
to a breakup of the family.

451
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,035
MISSY:

452
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,035
He's right.

453
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,497
Fred and Wilma

454
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,497
are still happily married.

455
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,415
I think if we can figure out

456
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,542
a way for Dad to get

457
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,542
Meemaw's brisket recipe,

458
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:55,876
this all goes away.

459
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,796
I don't see how

460
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,796
we can accomplish that.

461
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,172
(train clatters)

462
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,715
Put that down.

463
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,091
That's not a toy.

464
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,301
Sure it is.

465
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,594
Choo choo.

466
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:07,180
MEEMAW:

467
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:07,180
<i>Choo choo...</i>

468
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,766
Choo choo.

469
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,310
Open wide, Moonpie.

470
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,771
Here comes the choo choo train.

471
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,606
Choo choo.

472
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,857
Mmm. Isn't that good?

473
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,026
(chuckles)

474
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,530
That's Meemaw's famous brisket.

475
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,699
Would you like

476
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,699
the secret recipe?

477
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,074
(gasps)

478
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,703
You promise not to tell anybody?

479
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,580
Of course you're not gonna

480
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,580
tell anybody.

481
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:36,042
I start with a tablespoon

482
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:36,042
of cumin,

483
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,420
and then a cup

484
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,420
of brown sugar, and...

485
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,963
I know the recipe.

486
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,215
What?

487
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,424
She told it to me.

488
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,425
When?

489
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,302
February 14, 1982.

490
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,847
I was 23 months old,

491
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,847
it was Valentine's Day,

492
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,515
and Mom and Dad

493
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,515
went out for dinner.

494
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,017
You were there.

495
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,017
Don't you remember?

496
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,935
(sighs)

497
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,980
(wind whistling softly)

498
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,482
I got nothing.

499
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,609
You can really remember

500
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,609
when you were that little?

501
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,611
Uh-huh. You were there, too.

502
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,321
You were still struggling

503
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,321
with potty training.

504
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,156
(chuckling):

505
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,156
I don't think so.

506
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,493
Oh, yes. Meemaw used to call you

507
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,493
Mr. Soggy Pants.

508
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:11,452
Nuh-uh.

509
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,204
(laughs):

510
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,204
Mr. Soggy Pants.

511
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,914
Quit it. This is serious.

512
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,750
Sheldon, you've got

513
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,750
to tell Dad that recipe.

514
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,669
But Meemaw told me

515
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,669
it was a secret.

516
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,463
If you don't, and Mom and Dad

517
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,463
get a divorce, it's your fault.

518
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,591
All right.

519
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,884
Fine.

520
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,554
Good job, Soggy Pants.

521
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,556
(referee whistle blowing

522
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,556
over TV)

523
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,768
Dad, could you please

524
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,768
come into the living room?

525
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,227
What for?

526
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,478
My brain

527
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,478
did something impressive

528
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,480
and I'd like to share it

529
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,480
with you.

530
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,316
Hmm.

531
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,319
(George Sr. grunts)

532
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,323
What are you doing here?

533
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,950
Same as you.

534
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,993
I want to see

535
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,993
what his brain did.

536
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,580
Please have a seat.

537
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,957
All right.

538
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,543
(grunts)

539
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,044
GEORGE SR.:

540
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,044
Well?

541
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,422
I know Meemaw's brisket recipe.

542
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,339
What?

543
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,382
No, you don't.

544
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:07,801
Yes, I do.

545
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:10,094
And in order to bring peace

546
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:10,094
to this family,

547
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,846
I'm prepared to make it public.

548
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:12,847
You're bluffing.

549
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,223
One tablespoon of cumin,

550
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:15,600
one cup of brown sugar,

551
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,685
two tablespoons

552
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,685
of smoked paprika...

553
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:18,812
Okay, okay, stop.

554
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,062
No, no, no. Keep going.

555
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,606
How do you know

556
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,606
the recipe, Shelly?

557
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,275
Meemaw told it to me

558
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,275
on Valentine's Day, 1982.

559
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,402
You were out with Dad

560
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,402
seeing<i> Cannonball Run</i>

561
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,987
at the dollar theater.

562
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,573
That's impossible, you weren't

563
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,573
even two years old.

564
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,325
Three tablespoons

565
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,325
of dried mustard,

566
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,118
one cup of Lone Star beer...

567
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,913
Okay.

568
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,665
Okay.

569
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,333
Go ahead.

570
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,918
Give it to your father.

571
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,878
I can write it down for you.

572
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,173
That's okay,

573
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,173
I don't want it.

574
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,634
(quietly):

575
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,634
You have got to be kidding me.

576
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:50,927
Connie, you've had

577
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:50,927
every opportunity

578
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,428
to give me that recipe

579
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,428
and you never did,

580
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,221
because you've always

581
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,221
treated me like an outsider.

582
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,222
No, she has not.

583
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,474
Oh, of course I have.

584
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,767
See? She admits it.

585
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,853
(sighs)

586
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,853
Damn right, I do.

587
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:03,356
Never thought you were good

588
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:03,356
enough for my daughter.

589
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,650
There you were, riding around

590
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,650
on that dumb motorcycle,

591
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,859
knocking her up.

592
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,694
Why don't you kids

593
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,694
go in the kitchen

594
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,069
and fix yourselves

595
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,069
some ice cream?

596
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,865
I'm not going anywhere.

597
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,035
Hey. I get it.

598
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,621
I have a daughter.

599
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,915
I wouldn't want her bringing

600
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,915
home someone like that.

601
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,335
But I've come

602
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,335
a hell of a long way since then.

603
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,758
Okay, you're right.

604
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,430
George.

605
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,976
I'm sorry.

606
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,773
That means more to me

607
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,773
than any recipe.

608
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,027
Come here.

609
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,320
(Meemaw chuckles)

610
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,493
ADULT SHELDON:

611
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,493
<i>Don't let the hug fool you.</i>

612
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,996
<i>The minute she went home,</i>

613
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,996
<i>he made me give him the recipe.</i>

614
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,002
Here we go, maiden voyage.

615
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,797
Mmm, mmm.

616
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,507
Hot damn.

617
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,176
GEORGE SR.:

618
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,176
<i>Hot damn.</i>

619
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,471
(George Sr. moaning)

620
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,306
Hot damn!

621
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,601
MARY (laughs):

622
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,601
George! Language.

623
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,936
Sheldon.

624
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,270
Want some?

625
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,607
Uh, no, thank you.

626
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,607
I'm not hungry.

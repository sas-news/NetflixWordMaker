00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,170
<i>(George Sr. and Mary laughing)</i>

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:05,506
I thought you didn't like

3
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:05,506
taking the Lord's name in vain?

4
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,090
Oh, shut up.

5
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,050
(chuckles)

6
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,761
It's been a while, huh?

7
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:11,971
Don't blame me.

8
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:13,639
You're the one

9
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:13,639
who had a heart attack.

10
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:17,184
Mm, the doctor did say

11
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:17,184
I needed to get more exercise.

12
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,060
I think he meant

13
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,060
walks around the block.

14
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,855
No, he winked at me,

15
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,231
and did this little rotation

16
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,231
with his hips, like...

17
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,901
(laughs)

18
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,235
Mm.

19
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,403
Hmm.

20
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,614
Hey, we got any plans

21
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,614
this weekend?

22
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:33,742
I thought maybe we could get

23
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:33,742
started on the vegetable garden,

24
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,453
and then, of course,

25
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,453
church on Sunday.

26
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,288
Yeah, that does sound fun,

27
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,916
but what if, instead,

28
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,916
I was to go up to Bethy Creek

29
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,751
with Georgie

30
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,751
and do some fishing?

31
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,170
How long you been waiting

32
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,170
to spring that on me?

33
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,506
Well, not till I was done

34
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,506
rotating my hips.

35
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,132
You're awful.

36
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,132
(chuckles)

37
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,467
(scoffs)

38
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,803
So what do you say?

39
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,223
What about Sheldon?

40
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,099
What about him?

41
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,184
George.

42
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,144
You can't always leave him out.

43
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,521
I'm not leaving him out.

44
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,188
You know how

45
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,188
he is about fishing.

46
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,358
Get it away, get it away!

47
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,651
Calm down,

48
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,651
it's an itty-bitty thing.

49
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,862
No,<i> I'm</i> an itty-bitty thing!

50
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:12,155
Who says you have to

51
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:12,155
take him fishing?

52
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,699
Find something else

53
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,699
to do with him.

54
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:14,909
Something he'd like.

55
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,284
What are we gonna do?

56
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,284
Spend the weekend

57
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,745
sitting around, thinking?

58
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:18,829
George.

59
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,372
You have to make an effort.

60
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,249
Young boys who don't spend

61
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,249
time with their daddies

62
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,501
grow up to be oddballs.

63
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,546
Honey, I hate to tell you, but

64
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,546
that ball is already pretty odd.

65
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,592
Please.

66
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,220
Okay, fine.

67
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,390
I'll talk to him.

68
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,390
We'll think of something.

69
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,516
Good.

70
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,894
Thank you.

71
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,894
(grumbles)

72
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:44,271
(laughs)

73
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,273
What?

74
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,609
I was just remembering

75
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,609
when I took him camping.

76
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,985
SHELDON:

77
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,985
Moth! Moth!

78
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,653
GEORGE SR.:

79
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,653
Sheldon, it's just a butterfly.

80
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:52,947
How is that any better?

81
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,990
Butterfly, butterfly!

82
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,575

83
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,578

Hey, pal.

90
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,185
Playing with your rockets?

91
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,981
I'm trying to calculate

92
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,981
ballistic coefficients.

93
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,566
Well, that's fun, too.

94
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,401
Listen, I don't have

95
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,401
to work this weekend;

96
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,654
I was wondering if you wanted

97
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,654
to do something together.

98
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,905
Like what?

99
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,740
Whatever you want.

100
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,284
Well, the filter on my air

101
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,284
purifier needs to be changed.

102
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,828
How about a trip to Sears?

103
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,330
Yeah, I was thinking

104
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,330
along the lines of something

105
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,498
a little more active.

106
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,833
Like last year,

107
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:46,917
we went fishing...

108
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,002
Mom! Dad's trying

109
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,168
to make me go fishing!

110
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,629
No, no, it's okay.

111
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,340
We're not going fishing.

112
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,676
All right, good.

113
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,844
But seriously,

114
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,219
was fishing really that bad?

115
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,139
Mom! Dad's trying to convince me

116
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,849
that fishing wasn't that bad!

117
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,100
Shh. Come on!

118
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:04,601
Forget I said anything

119
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:04,601
about fishing.

120
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,561
Just think about it,

121
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,563
and we'll do whatever you want.

122
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,398
Thank you.

123
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,946
There is the launching of

124
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,946
the space shuttle this weekend.

125
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:17,405
Space shuttle?

126
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,198
Don't they do those

127
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,198
out of Florida?

128
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,160
Yes. Cape Canaveral.

129
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,873
Sheldon, that's-that's like

130
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,873
a 12, 15 hour drive.

131
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:29,250
I understand. Never mind.

132
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,337
You know what? Let's do it.

133
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,922
It'll be fun.

134
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,341
The three Cooper boys

135
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,341
on a little adventure.

136
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,509
Sound good?

137
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,845
Sounds good.

138
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,391
ADULT SHELDON:

139
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,391
<i>My plan was coming together.</i>

140
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,601
<i>I just needed to get</i>

141
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,601
<i>on the shuttle</i>

142
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:50,438
<i>so I could finally escape</i>

143
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:50,438
<i>this ridiculous planet.</i>

144
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,942
<i>Spoiler alert, I'm still here.</i>

145
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,360
So, Sheldon, me and Georgie

146
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,112
are gonna take

147
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,112
a little road trip this weekend,

148
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,572
see the shuttle launch.

149
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,157
Looks like I don't

150
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,157
get a vote in this.

151
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,034
Oh, good, you're catching on.

152
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:04,452
I wonder if we'll get

153
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:04,452
to meet an astronaut.

154
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,080
I remember

155
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,080
when I was a teenager,

156
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:09,083
I had the biggest crush

157
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:09,083
on John Glenn. (chuckles)

158
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,210
I would've given it up

159
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,210
for him no problem.

160
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,170
Mom.

161
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,170
Given what up?

162
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,005
Her allowance.

163
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,005
Just eat.

164
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,630
So how long

165
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,630
are you gonna be gone?

166
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,050
Oh, we'll leave first thing

167
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,050
Saturday morning,

168
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,384
stay the night in a motel,

169
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,803
and see the launch

170
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,803
bright and early on Sunday.

171
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,263
I can't believe

172
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,263
we're going to see

173
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,432
an actual working spacecraft.

174
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,101
Look how happy he is.

175
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,268
Good job.

176
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,686
How come I don't get to go?

177
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,063
'Cause you, me and Meemaw

178
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,355
are gonna have our own fun.

179
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,942
Could we shoot guns

180
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,942
at the gun range?

181
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,693
Mm, you're too young

182
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,693
to go to the gun range.

183
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,153
Meemaw took me.

184
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,072
We pinky swore.

185
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,072
What are you doing?

186
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,281
Oh, yeah.

187
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,449
Don't listen to me.

188
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,576
I don't know what I'm saying.

189
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,874
I know you like

190
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,874
to just keep driving,

191
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,918
and get where you're going,

192
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,918
but you can't ignore

193
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,045
his bathroom schedule.

194
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,045
I know.

195
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,047
He goes number one

196
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,047
first thing in the morning,

197
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:00,050
then again in the afternoon,

198
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:00,050
once more in the late afternoon,

199
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,928
say 4:00, 4:30,

200
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,928
depending on his juice intake,

201
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,013
and then, a quick piddle

202
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,013
before bedtime.

203
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,641
"Piddle." Got it.

204
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,641
Now,

205
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,850
number two's a little trickier.

206
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:09,851
Mary? Relax.

207
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,186
I can take care of my son.

208
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,687
I know.

209
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,772
Good.

210
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:14,689
I'm just saying,

211
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,857
if he's upset

212
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,857
or nervous,

213
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,818
he can get all clogged up.

214
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,069
I won't let that happen.

215
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,445
Thank you.

216
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,571
Okay, let's talk about food.

217
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:22,990
No need to.

218
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,785
He likes his meat cooked

219
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,785
to at least 165 degrees,

220
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,620
except for chicken,

221
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,620
which is 180.

222
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,998
The different foods can't touch

223
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,998
each other on the plate.

224
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,167
Ketchup and mustard

225
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,167
must come out of a packet.

226
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,459
No bottles.

227
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,755
What about his issues

228
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,755
with spaghetti?

229
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,674
That's a trick question.

230
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,467
He likes spaghetti.

231
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,553
All right, I guess you got this.

232
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,560
<i>(door opens)</i>

233
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,233
Georgie.

234
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,233
(knocks on door)

235
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,359
Up and at 'em.

236
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,363
Missy, where's

237
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,363
your brother?

238
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,825
Who cares?

239
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,167
Sheldon, you in there?

240
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,417
GEORGE JR.:

241
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,417
Dad!

242
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,753
Sorry, Georgie.

243
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,047
What's going on?

244
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,257
I can't find Sheldon.

245
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,301
What do you mean,

246
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,301
you can't find him?

247
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,220
I mean I don't know where he is.

248
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,180
Well, he's got to be somewhere.

249
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:31,016
Maybe he got that time machine

250
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:31,016
to work.

251
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,186
Where the hell...

252
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,021
George.

253
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,524
MARY:

254
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,524
I think he's ready to go.

255
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,238
(grunts)

256
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,530
MARY:

257
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,530
Wait, Georgie.

258
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,532
Where's your bag?

259
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,532
Don't need one.

260
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,825
Got my toothbrush right here.

261
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,160
What about clothes?

262
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,619
A change of underwear?

263
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,996
Got it.

264
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,165
Georgie, you're gonna

265
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,165
be gone for two days.

266
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,875
I'll turn them inside out.

267
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,460
Shotgun!

268
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,460
No, no.

269
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,129
Let your brother sit

270
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,129
up front for a change.

271
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,421
I actually prefer

272
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,421
sitting in the back.

273
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,757
It's safer.

274
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,425
Oh, come on, sit up front

275
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,425
with your daddy.

276
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,136
He doesn't get to spend

277
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,136
enough time with you.

278
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,721
I called shotgun.

279
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,972
George.

280
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,350
We'll flip a coin.

281
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,435
All right?

282
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,435
Georgie, call it.

283
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,811
Heads.

284
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,189
Tails.

285
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,440
Dang it.

286
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,440
Sheldon, you won.

287
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,900
You get to ride up front.

288
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,402
Can't we do two out of three?

289
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,570
You won. Get in the car.

290
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,739
What's the point

291
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,739
in calling shotgun?

292
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,408
You're a good dad.

293
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,826
If I don't kill one of them

294
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,826
before Sunday, I'm a good dad.

295
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,913
Have fun.

296
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,332
Love you guys.

297
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,168
Bye! Drive safe!

298
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,088
(engine starts)

299
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:49,803
Oh, this was a good idea,

300
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:49,803
this was a good idea,

301
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,930
this was a good idea.

302
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,767
This was a good idea.

303
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,729
Isn't this exciting?

304
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,522
It's just us girls,

305
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,522
no boys in the house.

306
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,774
The place already smells better.

307
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:03,900
(laughs)

308
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,152
So what are we gonna do?

309
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,320
How would you like

310
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,737
to go to the beauty salon

311
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,239
and get all done up?

312
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,450
Can I have orange hair

313
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,450
like Cyndi Lauper?

314
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,452
I don't think so.

315
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,745
Meemaw has friends

316
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,745
with blue hair.

317
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,705
She's right.

318
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,957
I haven't gone there yet,

319
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,376
but after a certain age,

320
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,376
it's mandatory.

321
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,585
(chuckles)

322
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,296
Your hair's not changing color.

323
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,173
Aw.

324
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,173
Sorry, kiddo.

325
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,716
Your mom is no fun.

326
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,760
Excuse me, I'm fun.

327
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:31,928
So I can color my hair?

328
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,179
Not a chance.

329
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,722
But I'm very much fun.

330
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,433
Whatever you need to believe.

331
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:40,102
Mein Führer.

332
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,362
(rock music playing)

333
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,197
(music continues faintly

334
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,197
over headphones)

335
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,198
Dad?

336
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,407
Yeah?

337
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,368
Would you like

338
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,368
to have a conversation?

339
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,120
Yeah. Sure.

340
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,120
Absolutely.

341
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,622
All right, what would you

342
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,622
like to talk about?

343
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,625
Um, well, let's see.

344
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,586
Uh... have you given much

345
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,586
thought to what you want to be

346
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,796
when you grow up?

347
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,049
I have.

348
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,343
Great.

349
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:15,596
And what would that be?

350
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,766
Oh. Most likely a scientist.

351
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,396
Unless I stay in Texas,

352
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,396
then I'm thinking cattle baron.

353
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,688
Cattle baron?

354
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,899
Assuming I don't have

355
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,899
to touch the cows.

356
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,026
Goes without saying.

357
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,611
Did you always want

358
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,611
to be a football coach?

359
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,447
Well, I always

360
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,447
wanted to play.

361
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,948
At least till

362
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,948
I got hurt.

363
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,867
Mm.

364
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,327
Were you a good player?

365
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,538
Eh, not really.

366
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,415
I was just bigger

367
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,415
than the other kids.

368
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,875
So you compensated

369
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,875
for mediocrity

370
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,460
by being large.

371
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,588
I guess.

372
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,173
That works for cattle as well.

373
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,050
Oh, well, thanks for

374
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,050
pointing that out.

375
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,176
You're welcome.

376
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,347
(loudly): You might want to

377
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,347
open a window.

378
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,973
Oh, boy.

379
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,642
(rock music continues playing)

380
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,395
Oh...

381
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:07,023
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, yeah... ♪

382
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,193
My head is so hot.

383
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,946
(chuckling):

384
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,946
She is such a hoot.

385
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,324
You okay?

386
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,324
Fine.

387
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,578
Okay, don't tell me.

388
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,622
MISSY:

389
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,622
So hot...

390
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,165
I don't like you

391
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,165
making me out

392
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,666
to be the bad guy

393
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,666
just 'cause I won't

394
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,544
let my daughter do

395
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,544
whatever she wants.

396
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:28,669
I gave you a lot

397
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:28,669
of freedom,

398
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,130
you turned out okay.

399
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,672
You didn't

400
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,672
give me freedom.

401
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,133
You were never around.

402
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,759
Is that so?

403
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,512
I guarantee I made supper

404
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,512
for Charlene and Edward

405
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:38,888
more times than you ever did.

406
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,307
I basically raised 'em.

407
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,808
You think I was

408
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,808
out dancing?

409
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,726
I was out working two jobs

410
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,726
so your daddy could

411
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,229
lose all our money on that

412
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,229
damn chain of Fotomats!

413
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,356
It wasn't Daddy's fault that

414
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,356
those little things blew over

415
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,983
every time

416
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,983
there was a storm.

417
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,734
Hmm.

418
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,237
Seriously,

419
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,237
I'm melting.

420
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,907
GEORGE JR.:

421
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,907
<i>Dead armadillo.</i>

422
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,326
That's three for me.

423
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,245
This is a terrible

424
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,245
driving game.

425
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,038
Is it roadkill if

426
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,038
it's still twitchin'?

427
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,335
Huh, both alive and dead,

428
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,335
just like Schrödinger's cat.

429
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,128
I didn't know he had a cat.

430
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,712
You've heard of Schrödinger?

431
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,714
Sure. It's the kid

432
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,714
from Charlie Brown

433
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,966
who plays the piano.

434
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,260
Lucy's got

435
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,260
a crush on him.

436
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,388
(sighs) Schrödinger's cat

437
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,388
is a thought experiment.

438
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,517
A cat in a box is

439
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,517
exposed to poison,

440
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,768
and is both alive and dead

441
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,768
until it is observed.

442
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,812
So the cat's name

443
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,812
is Schrödinger?

444
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:28,980
No.

445
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,440
Well, what's its name?

446
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,108
Its name doesn't matter.

447
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,692
It does if the cat was dead.

448
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,778
Otherwise, what are you gonna

449
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,778
put on his tombstone?

450
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,114
Not likely the cat's

451
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,114
getting a tombstone.

452
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,824
It would in a pet cemetery.

453
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,034
(Sheldon sighs)

454
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,370
Fine, the cat's name

455
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,370
is Mittens.

456
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,288
Because he has

457
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,288
little white feet?

458
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,956
Sure.

459
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,707
So, in this thought

460
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,707
experiment,

461
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,294
do you think Mittens

462
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,294
is dead or alive?

463
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:54,088
There's no way of saying

464
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:54,088
until you open the box.

465
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,174
Oh, come on.

466
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,469
Optimistically, I would choose

467
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,469
to believe he's alive.

468
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,429
Yes!

469
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,429
Oh, thank goodness.

470
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,097
GEORGE JR.:

471
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,097
Oh, dead crow.

472
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,849
<i>There ain't no doubt</i>

473
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,849
<i>about that one.</i>

474
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,981
The toilet was sanitized

475
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,981
for my protection.

476
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,525
I love this place.

477
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,152
Dad, can we go

478
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,152
to Reptile World?

479
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,654
No.

480
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,654
They a got snake

481
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,698
so big it can eat

482
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,698
a whole chicken.

483
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,908
Oh, well, in that case, no.

484
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,784
Aw.

485
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,784
Let's get some sleep.

486
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,953
We got to get up early if we're

487
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,953
gonna get to Cape Canaveral

488
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,205
in time for liftoff.

489
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,790
I'm so excited,

490
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,790
I don't know if I can.

491
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,376
Well, buddy, you're

492
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,376
gonna have to try, all right?

493
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,794
You two share that bed,

494
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,794
I'll take this one.

495
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,380
No.

496
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,380
Nuh-uh.

497
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,965
Come on, fellas,

498
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,965
I'm the biggest.

499
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,427
It makes sense that

500
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,427
I get a bed to myself.

501
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,637
No.

502
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,637
Nuh-uh.

503
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,806
(sighs)

504
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,184
We'll flip for it.

505
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,184
Georgie, call it.

506
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,728
Heads.

507
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,272
(clicks tongue)

508
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,272
Not your day.

509
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,648
Dang it.

510
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,317
That looked like heads.

511
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,317
Go brush your teeth.

512
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,448
This really works?

513
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:06,369
Your hair will look

514
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:06,369
just as pretty tomorrow.

515
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,623
Now, come on,

516
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,623
let's tuck you in.

517
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,832
I'm glad I don't have

518
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,832
orange hair.

519
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,293
Me, too, baby.

520
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,086
I want to be

521
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,086
more like Madonna.

522
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,837
Are you trying to kill me?

523
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,214
'Cause if you are, good job.

524
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,763
Why is she only like a virgin?

525
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,514
MARY: Good night!

526
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,514
(door closes)

527
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,519
You ready to finish

528
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,519
our conversation?

529
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,895
There's nothing

530
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,895
to finish.

531
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,064
I raised myself

532
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,064
like a jungle child.

533
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,274
End of story.

534
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,192
Oh, stop being so dramatic.

535
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,611
You think I didn't feel bad

536
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,238
not being around more

537
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,238
than I wanted to be?

538
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,573
Did you?

539
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,824
A little bit.

540
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,787
I'm teasing, come on.

541
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,787
Of course I did.

542
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,622
Why else would I have

543
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,622
begged you and George

544
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:51,872
to move back to Medford?

545
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,667
So you could be with

546
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,667
your grandchildren.

547
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,584
And you.

548
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,461
Really?

549
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,461
Yeah.

550
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,630
You're the only one of my

551
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,630
children still talking to me.

552
00:13:58,672 --> 00:13:59,922
No surprise there.

553
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,299
Besides, you raised yourself

554
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,925
better than I ever could.

555
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,969
You actually believe that?

556
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,847
No, but it would help

557
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,847
my cause if you did.

558
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,852
(sighs)

559
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,775
Your hair looks pretty.

560
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,276
Enough.

561
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,613
(snickers)

562
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,658
(chuckling)

563
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,618
(snoring softly)

564
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,954
(whispering):

565
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,954
Dad?

566
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,873
Dad?

567
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,501
Dad?

568
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,795
Dad.

569
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,795
(snorts)

570
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:39,920
What?

571
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,548
Georgie keeps kicking me.

572
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,049
Kick him back.

573
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,385
I'd rather not touch him.

574
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,556
You want to sleep with me?

575
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,265
Yes, thank you.

576
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,062
Yeah.

577
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,358
Got enough room?

578
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,026
Yes.

579
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,200
You throw off

580
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,200
a lot of heat.

581
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,661
Sorry.

582
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,664
That's all right.

583
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,664
It's kind of nice.

584
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,755
(thunder rumbles)

585
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,595
Do they launch those shuttles

586
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,595
in the rain?

587
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,389
I think a light rain's okay.

588
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,809
(thunder crashes)

589
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,519
Oh, no.

590
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,187
It'll pass.

591
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,273
Just get some sleep.

592
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,529
(thunder crashes)

593
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,031
It didn't pass.

594
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,117
Sheldon, I'm real sorry.

595
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,711
Can I tell you a secret?

596
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,171
I never understood

597
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,171
how lightning works.

598
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,591
Didn't they teach you

599
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,591
that in high school?

600
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,008
They probably did,

601
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,305
but I got hit in the head

602
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,305
a lot playing football.

603
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,474
Would you explain it

604
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,474
to me?

605
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,811
Well, when positive and negative

606
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,811
charges grow large enough,

607
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,146
a giant spark occurs

608
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,146
in the cloud.

609
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:23,817
Ah, that-that's pretty cool.

610
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:23,817
What causes the thunder?

611
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:27,904
It's a shock wave from particles

612
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:27,904
heated to 10,000 degrees.

613
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,405
Interesting.

614
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,741
You want to know what's

615
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,741
really interesting?

616
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,741
Hmm?

617
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,868
Aristotle thought that

618
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,868
the sound of thunder

619
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,036
was due to a collision

620
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,036
between two clouds.

621
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,205
He believed the clouds were

622
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,205
expelling air,

623
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,124
in the way a log on

624
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,124
a fire crackles...

625
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,043
ADULT SHELDON:<i> I didn't realize</i>

626
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,043

627
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,546

628

629

<i>about lightning and thunder</i>

630
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,633
<i>to cheer me up.</i>

631
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,177
<i>In fact, he would often</i>

632
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,177
<i>pretend to be dumb</i>

633
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,929
<i>just to make me feel better.</i>

634
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,848
Looks like rain.

<i>My brother, on the other hand,</i>

637
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,184
<i>didn't have to pretend.</i>

638
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,567
Okay, on the count of three,

639
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,567
we run to the car.

640
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,319
Ready? One, two...

641
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,319
Wait.

642
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,738
I want shotgun going back.

643
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,782
Fine, you get shotgun.

644
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,782
Okay, here we go.

645
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,868
One, two...

646
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,868
I still think

647
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,037
we should wait

648
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,037
till the rain slows down.

649
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,372
GEORGE SR.:

650
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,372
No, we got to get home.

651
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,374
I got work tomorrow,

652
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,374
you guys got school.

653
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,125
You do realize I'll get wet?

654
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,544
It's just water, Sheldon.

655
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,253
All right.

656
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,253
Just making sure you realize.

657
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,465
All right, here we go. Ready?

658
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,800

00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,965
Someone is hurting our son.

197
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,965
I understand.

198
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,134
But handling bullies

199
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,134
is tricky. It...

200
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,303
It's easy to

201
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,303
make things worse.

202
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,138
And what makes you the expert?

203
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,891
Honey, I was a bully.

204
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,433
MEEMAW:

205
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,433
He's right.

206
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,644
You get involved in this

207
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,644
in the wrong way,

208
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,605
and they'll take it out

209
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,605
on Sheldon.

210
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,441
Well, I'm sorry,

211
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,441
but I can't just stand by.

212
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,201
Georgie, I need to talk

213
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,201
to you, and wake up,

214
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,827
you're gonna be late.

215
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:54,122
Got it covered.

216
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:54,122
I slept in my clothes.

217
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,666
Oh, Lord. Look, somebody has

218
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,666
been picking on your brother.

219
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,001
You know anything

220
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,001
about it?

221
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,418
No.

222
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,130
You better not be

223
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,130
covering for anybody.

224
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,007
I'm not. Most kids

225
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,007
at school ignore him,

226
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,759
and the girls

227
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,759
all think he's cute.

228
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,094
It's kind of annoying.

229
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,346
Well, I need you

230
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,346
to look after him.

231
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,014
Why?

232
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,350
Because I'm your mother,

233
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,350
and I'm asking you nicely.

234
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:14,809
What if I don't want to?

235
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,979
I don't care, you're doing it.

236
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,441
How was that nice?

237
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:24,152
So there I was flying

238
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:24,152
above the city,

239
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,529
but when I woke up,

240
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,529
I couldn't fly.

241
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,990
That's like the dream you had

242
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,990
where you were dating Madonna,

243
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,700
but when you woke up,

244
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,700
you weren't.

245
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,411
Exactly.

246
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,495
You ever have the ones where

247
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,495
your teeth are falling out?

248
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,540
Better my teeth

249
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,540
than my hair, but...

250
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,419
Sheldon?

251
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,419
Over here.

252
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,712
What are you doing?

253
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,712
Hiding.

254
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,089
From who?

255
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,676
Is Billy the one

256
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,676
giving you trouble?

257
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,970
No.

258
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,055
His dad?

259
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,015
No.

260
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,644
No...

261
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,398
She's a demon.

262
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,237
The little Sparks girl?

263
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,364
You're kidding.

264
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,364
She seems so sweet.

265
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,117
He says she slaps him around,

266
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,117
takes his lunch money.

267
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,828
She even put a tadpole

268
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,828
down his shirt.

269
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,539
Poor kid,

270
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,539
he tucks in those shirts.

271
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,551
She looks harmless.

272
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,551
She's cute.

273
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,804
So she probably gets

274
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,804
away with stuff.

275
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,847
I'm like that.

276
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,018
I wonder if stray cats

277
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,018
poop in that sandbox.

278
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:39,394
MARY:

279
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:39,394
George.

280
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,191
You need to talk

281
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,191
to her parents.

282
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,525
Me? Why me?

283
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,403
Because you're more

284
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,403
intimidating than me.

285
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,655
That's rich.

286
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,791
Hey, Billy.

287
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,877
Hello, Missy's dad.

288
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,921
Is your father home?

289
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,921
Yes.

290
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,508
Could you get him for me?

291
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,218
Happy to.

292
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,303
Dad, it's Missy's dad!

293
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:16,014
He's also Sheldon's dad!

294
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,307
HERSCHEL:

295
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,307
Well, howdy, neighbor.

296
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,641
Hey, Herschel.

297
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,060
What brings you by?

298
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,060
Chickens too loud?

299
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,354
Nah, they been fine.

300
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,354
Good, good.

301
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,314
Fried up the noisy one

302
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,314
last week.

303
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,233
That shut him up.

304
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,233
Anyway, how can I help?

305
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,026
Uh, well...

306
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,029
It's come to my

307
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,029
attention that, uh...

308
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,948
Sheldon's run into a bit

309
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,948
of trouble with your daughter.

310
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,492
What kind of trouble?

311
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:38,453
He says she been beating on him.

312
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,622
My Bobbi?

313
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,622
Yeah.

314
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,333
This one? The six-year-old?

315
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,294
Bobbi, get over here!

316
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,506
You realize I've taken dumps

317
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,506
bigger than this kid.

318
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,008
Hi, Daddy.

319
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,008
Hey, babydoll, uh,

320
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,845
Mr. Cooper says that you've

321
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,845
been picking on Sheldon.

322
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,639
Now, is that true?

323
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,639
No, Daddy.

324
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,183
Are you sure?

325
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:03,019
Okay, go wash up

326
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:03,019
for dinner.

327
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,147
I don't know what

328
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,147
to tell you, George.

329
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,399
I mean, is it,

330
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,399
is it possible

331
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,900
your son has a

332
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,900
little crush on her?

333
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,818
Oh, I don't think

334
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,818
he's wired that way.

335
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,113
Oh, are you saying

336
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,113
that he's a...

337
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,450
No, no, I'm saying he's

338
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,450
a bookworm. (chuckles)

339
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,744
Unless she's math or a

340
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,744
dictionary, he ain't interested.

341
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,329
Mm.

342
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,329
Yeah.

343
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,873
Thanks for hearin' me out.

344
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,084
Your wife sent you over here,

345
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,084
didn't she?

346
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,752
I don't want

347
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,752
to talk about it.

348
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,752
(chuckles)

349
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,379
I bet she did!

350
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:30,671
Not talkin' about it!

351
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,173
Tell her I said hi!

352
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,967
(chuckles)

353
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:37,845
How'd it go?

354
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,056
Uh, good. Yeah.

355
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,933
I handled it.

356
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,393
Oh, thank the Lord.

357
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,852
Yeah. Me and the Lord.

358
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,771
Team effort.

359
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,152
(whirring)

360
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,289
Hello, Bobbi.

361
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,874
You told on me.

362
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,835
Well, actually,

363
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,835
my brother

364
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:12,297
figured it out, so, technically,

365
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:12,297
I would argue that I didn't.

366
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,424
Doesn't matter.

367
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,968
Uh, I should let you know,

368
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,677
I've read a book

369
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,677
on jiu-jitsu.

370
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,848
And I'm prepared

371
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,848
to throw it at you.

372
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,020
(screaming)

373
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,813
Shelly, it's just Bactine.

374
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:30,857
Aah!

375
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,108
I didn't even put it

376
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,568
on you yet.

377
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,195
(shushing softly)

378
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,531
You want to tell me

379
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,531
what happened?

380
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,241
Bobbi Sparks

381
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,241
came into the garage...

382
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,410
And she attacked you?

383
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,621
Not exactly.

384
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,621
I tried to use jiu-jitsu on her,

385
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,414
but I tripped and fell.

386
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,792
Aw, baby. I'm so sorry

387
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,792
you're havin' to deal with this.

388
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,294
It's okay.

389
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,880
German philosopher

390
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,880
Friedrich Nietzsche said,

391
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,924
"That which does not kill us

392
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,924
makes us stronger."

393
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,135
And do you feel stronger?

394
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,720
No.

395
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,432
How are the knees?

396
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,975
Better, thank you.

397
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,686
Good.

398
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,271
And regarding this jiu-jitsu

399
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,271
stuff, you should know

400
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:13,066
that a man's not supposed

401
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:13,066
to raise his hand to a woman.

402
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,902
Oh, I won't. I don't want

403
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,902
to hurt myself again.

404
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,450
Did you ever have a bully

405
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,450
when you were growing up?

406
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,078
Have you met your grandma?

407
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,040
I thought you said

408
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,040
you handled it next door.

409
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:32,085
I did say that.

410
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,379
Where you goin'?

411
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,506
To handle it.

412
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,299
(quietly): Should've been you

413
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,299
in the first place.

414
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,634
What?

415
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:40,885
Good luck!

416
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,179
(door shuts)

417
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:46,433
Way to go, Scooby!

418
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:46,433
That's my newshound!

419
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,103
Missy, I could

420
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,103
really use your help.

421
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,271
With what?

422
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,814
I'm being bullied

423
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,814
by Bobbi Sparks.

424
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,483
Hilarious. Go on.

425
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,693
Madame Doo!

426
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,403
That's me!

427
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,780
Mom says a man should never

428
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,780
raise his hand to a woman.

429
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,242
But I believe I've

430
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,242
found a loophole.

431
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,578
You're a woman, so

432
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,578
you're allowed to hit her

433
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,870
as much as you want.

434
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,497
Why would I do that?

435
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:10,789
Because I'm willing to pay you.

436
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:11,999
How much?

437
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,834
My life savings,

438
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,834
four dollars.

439
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,545
That's a good start.

440
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,089
Now, let's talk TV privileges.

441
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,591
What do you want?

442
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,051
Complete control

443
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,051
every afternoon for two months.

444
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,345
That's when

445
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,345
Professor Proton is on.

446
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,973
I know. Sucks for you.

447
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,225
(sighs)

448
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,732
I'm on fire!

449
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,567
(laughs)

450
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:38,901
Hello, Brenda.

451
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,445
Oh, hey, Mary.

452
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,613
How many lanes you need?

453
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,948
Actually, I'm here

454
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,948
to talk to you.

455
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,493
Seems that our kids

456
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,493
are havin' a little problem.

457
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,578
Yeah. Herschel told me.

458
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,455
Oh, good, good.

459
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,666
So, I was wondering what

460
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,666
you're plannin' to do about it,

461
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:55,293
'cause the situation doesn't

462
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:55,293
seem to be gettin' any better.

463
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,003
Well, if you haven't noticed,

464
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,005
I'm at work right now.

465
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,923
I see that.

466
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,425
But you understand

467
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,552
that your daughter's being

468
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,552
abusive to my son.

469
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,930
Well, maybe your son needs

470
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,930
to grow a pair.

471
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,890
And in due time, he will.

472
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,518
But right now, I expect you

473
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,645
to teach your children

474
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,645
how to behave.

475
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,732
Connie Tucker

476
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,732
to the front desk, please.

477
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,567
Connie Tucker.

478
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,068
Why are

479
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,068
you calling her?

480
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,112
You say my daughter's

481
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,112
harassing your son.

482
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,948
Well, her daughter's

483
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,948
harassing me.

484
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,826
Hey, Mary.

485
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,952
What are you doin' here?

486
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,952
Well,

487
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,872
I was hopin' to have a rational

488
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,872
conversation about Shelly,

489
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,833
but there's only one person

490
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,833
being rational.

491
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,543
(grunts)

492
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,543
Uh, and it ain't you.

493
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,753
Could you excuse us

494
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,753
for just a minute?

495
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,091
Do you understand

496
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,091
that you are in the place

497
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,302
where I socialize three

498
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,302
to four days a week?

499
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,513
So you care more about bowling

500
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,513
than your grandson?

501
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,972
Of course not.

502
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,972
I'm just saying

503
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,725
maybe there's a better way

504
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,725
to go about it.

505
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,185
Now, I'm warnin' you,

506
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,185
Brenda is one mean--

507
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,854
I know you don't like

508
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,854
bad language,

509
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,606
but we are in a bowling alley--

510
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,606
one mean bitch.

511
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,983
Well, I can be mean, too.

512
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,737
Okay, you listen to me.

513
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,737
You get your kid

514
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:04,945
in line or I...

515
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,989
What are you doing?

516
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,199
Get out of here.

517
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,743
This is my place of business.

518
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,287
And now I see

519
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,287
where your daughter gets it.

520
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,581
BRENDA:

521
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,581
You know what?

522
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,290
I have been nothin' but nice

523
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,251
to you and your family

524
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,251
since the day y'all moved in,

525
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,627
and I'm over it.

526
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,254
Watching you walk

527
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,254
around all holier

528
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,839
than thou, like you're better

529
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,883
than everyone else.

530
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,883
Well, guess what,

531
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,509
you're not.

532
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,222
I'm gonna pray for you.

533
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:37,103
She says that to me

534
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:37,103
all the time.

535
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,898
I'm not even sure she does it.

536
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:48,948
How'd it go?

537
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,909
I don't want

538
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,909
to talk about it.

539
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,993
(sniffs)

540
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,993
Is that pine?

541
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,704
We're not talkin' about it.

542
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,831
(doorbell rings)

543
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,831
And you get that!

544
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,714
Herschel.

545
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,714
Hey, George.

546
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,090
It has come to my attention

547
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,885
that your wife went to speak

548
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,885
with my wife

549
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,511
at her place of work,

550
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,388
and, uh...

551
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,388
She send you over here?

552
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,600
Uh, the-the important thing is

553
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,600
that I'm here to tell you

554
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,394
that, uh, Mary's behavior

555
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,394
was inappropriate.

556
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,104
You know, it's interesting.

557
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,148
When I came to your house,

558
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,148
you were laughin',

559
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,357
and...

560
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,734
now you're all serious.

561
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,193
Why is that?

562
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,154
What do you say

563
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,154
we go talk about this

564
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,948
somewhere

565
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,948
a little more comfortable?

566
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,699
MARY (sharply):

567
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,699
Who's at the door?

568
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,206
(chickens clucking)

569
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,461
Make yourself at home.

570
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:44,671
Oh, boy.

571
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:45,922
You hang out in here?

572
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,214
Sure.

573
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,341
Once you get used to the smell,

574
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,510
it's not so bad.

575
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,510
(chuckles)

576
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,761
I coach a high

577
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,761
school football team.

578
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,095
This smells like petunias.

579
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,514
(laughs)

580
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,514
I like to...

581
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,266

583
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,769
come out here

584
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,769
and watch the games.

585
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,354
Ooh!

Your wife don't mind?

589
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,733
She don't know.

590
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,276
She's scared

591
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,276
to death of chickens.

592
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,069
Is that right?

593
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,069
Once I found out,

594
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,614
buildin' this coop

595
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,614

Listen, I'm sorry my wife

618
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,952

This is the most fun

623
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,500
I've had all week.

624
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,837
I-I feel bad about

625

the whole thing with the kids.

Hey, it happens.

627
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,258
I know, but Bobbi shouldn't be

628
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,258
beatin' on Sheldon like that.

629
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,885
It's not okay.

630
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,885
What's not okay

631
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,387
is Sheldon gettin' beat

632
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,387
up by a little girl.

633
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,847
Well...

634
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,181

(both chuckling)

636
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,685
Look, I'll talk to Bobbi.

637
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,896
I don't know if it'll help,

638
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,896
but I'll try.

639
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,398
Hey, you're a good man.

640
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,398
Mm.

641
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,859
Yeah, I-I should

642
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,859

00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,863

646
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,448
Yeah.

647
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,992
You know, we should probably get

648
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,992
our stories straight

649
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,160
before we talk

650
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,160
to our respective...

651
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,080

652
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,080
Sure.

653
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,706
What do you want to say?

654
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,374
How 'bout this?

655
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,376
We had words,

656
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,128
it almost got ugly,

657
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,504
but we came to an understanding.

658
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,714
I like that.

659
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,714
Yeah.

660
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,091
You want to take

661
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,091
a swing at me?

662
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,467
Make it look real?

663
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:57,511

665
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,014
No, no.

666
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,014
But you're sweet for offering.

667
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,725

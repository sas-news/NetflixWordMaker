00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:03,002
<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...

2
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:04,463
You know that Mr. Rosenbloom

3
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:04,463
with the furniture store

4
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,005
over by the steak house?

5
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:07,549
He's asked me to dinner.

6
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,092
Is he your boyfriend?

7
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,470
Well, he's one of them,

8
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,470
so let's not bring that up.

9
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,888
All right, so what can I do

10
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,888
for you?

11
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,598
What's it like

12
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,598
to be Jewish?

13
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,767
Oh, it's terrible.

14
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,767
I don't recommend it.

15
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:19,603
(phone ringing)

16
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:19,603
Yeah?

17
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,481
Connie, I would like

18
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,481
to have dinner with you tonight.

19
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,065
This is very promising.

20
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,860
SHELDON:

21
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,860
<i>Dr. Sturgis and Meemaw</i>

22
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,235
had their first

23
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,235
sleepover.

24
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,488
It's a big step

25
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,488
in their relationship.

26
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,657
I'm going to go

27
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,657
congratulate them.

28
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:34,409
Hey, put on a jacket,

29
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:34,409
it's chilly out.

30
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,246
♪ You're just too good

31
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,246
to be true... ♪

32
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:42,710
I have only seen you eat

33
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:42,710
vanilla ice cream for dessert.

34
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,712
Why is that?

35
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,712
Well, I've taken a page

36
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,715
from the great physicist

37
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,715
Richard Feynman.

38
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,216
In order to have

39
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,134
one less decision

40
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,134
in his life,

41
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:55,472
he decided that dessert would

42
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:55,472
always be chocolate ice cream.

43
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,558
Sounds like it could

44
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,558
get kind of boring.

45
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,767
Oh, it does.

46
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:02,021
But over the

47
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:02,021
last 35 years,

48
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,983
I believe I've saved

49
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,983
at least a day and a half.

50
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:08,068
♪ Pardon the way

51
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:08,068
that I stare... ♪

52
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,238
(laughing)

53
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,323
Well, you have to let me

54
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,323
cook for you sometime.

55
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,409
But I enjoy cooking for you.

56
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,828
It's a means of

57
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,828
expressing my affection.

58
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,623
It also allows me to control

59
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,623
the amount of garlic,

60
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,250
which gives me the burps.

61
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,253
Well, I do make

62
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,253
a mean barbecue,

63
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:29,006
and I promise I can

64
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:29,006
make it garlic-free.

65
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:30,549
Excellent!

66
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:34,428
Next time, you can express

67
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:34,428
your affection for me.

68
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,430
(chuckles)

69
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,139
(phone ringing)

70
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,139
Excuse me.

71
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,184
I bet it's Sheldon

72
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,184
checking on us.

73
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,310
What?

74
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,938
Connie? It's Ira.

75
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,231
(chuckling nervously):

76
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,231
Hey... Hey...

77
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,900
I'm, uh...

78
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:50,569
I-It's Sheldon.

79
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:50,569
He... sounds a little agitated.

80
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,987
I'm gonna take it

81
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,987
in the other room.

82
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,488
Just...

83
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,699
(partition clattering loudly)

84
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,203
(quietly):

85
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,203
Hello again.

86
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,914
Listen, I'm wondering what

87
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,914
you're doing this weekend.

88
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:02,831
I miss you.

89
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,417
Cool, cool.

90
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,919
You want to go to a movie

91
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,753
or bowl a few frames?

92
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,925
Uh, you know, listen,

93
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,925
it's not a great time right now.

94
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,384
Um, I have a little family over,

95
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,303
and can I call you later?

96
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,180
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.

97
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,180
I-I don't want to interrupt.

98
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,224
I just miss hearing your voice.

99
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,769
Well... here it is,

100
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,312
coming right up

101
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,312
out of my throat.

102
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,064
Um, okay,

103
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:29,190
so, uh, uh, bye.

104
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,692
Bye-bye.

105
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:33,779
How's Sheldon doing?

106
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,405
What?

107
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,405
Sheldon.

108
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,240
You were talking to Sheldon.

109
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,869
Oh... right, yes.

110
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,869
(chuckles)

111
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:44,205
Did you know he has a picture

112
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:44,205
of that fella Feynman

113
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,332
in his bedroom?

114
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,250
What? So do I.

115
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,710
Peas in a pod.

116
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,169
(phone ringing)

117
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,169
Oh, darn.

118
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,673
Excuse me.

119
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,883
Yes?

120
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:55,843
How's it going?

121
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,385
It's Sheldon again.

122
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,595
What do you mean "again"?

123
00:02:58,637 --> 00:02:59,805
Speak.

124
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,098
I recently read an article

125
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,350
about a superconducting

126
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,350
supercollider

127
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,810
that might be built in Texas.

128
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,645
What about it?

129
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:07,980
Well, I thought

130
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:07,980
if there was a lull

131
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,439
in your dinner conversation,

132
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,608
you might casually drop it

133
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,608
as an icebreaker.

134
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,402
Our dinner conversation

135
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,402
is going just fine.

136
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,404
Well, now you have it

137
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,404
in your back pocket.

138
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,656
Carry on.

139
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,075
(dial tone)

140
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,075
(chuckles)

141
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,369
(hangs up phone)

142
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,829
(clears throat)

143
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:27,248
Question-- will we be engaging

144
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:27,248
in coitus tonight?

145
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,878
Because I believe

146
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,878
I pulled a hamstring

147
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,171
on the bike ride over.

148
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,131
Why didn't you

149
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,131
say something?

150
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,884
Well, I was trying

151
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,884
to display machismo,

152
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,510
but it's becoming

153
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,510
more and more clear

154
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,889
that there's something

155
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,889
askew in my groin.

156
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,724
Oh, John...

157
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,851
we don't have

158
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,851
to do anything.

159
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,187
We can just be together.

160
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,688
Thanks.

161
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,356
But if it's all

162
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,356
the same to you,

163
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,734
I'd like to give it

164
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,734
the old college try.

165
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,444

Thank you.

174
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,801
So, you're really

175
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,801
gonna go out

176
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,261
with this furniture

177
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,261
store fella

178
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,763
while seeing Dr. Sturgis?

179
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,807
It's called playing the field.

180
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,559
And if you'd done

181
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,559
some of that,

182
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,895
you wouldn't be saddled

183
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,895
with Bluto in there.

184
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,188
That's not nice.

185
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,314
And is that

186
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,314
really necessary?

187
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,984
The Italians call it

188
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,984
"corretto."

189
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,278
It means correcting

190
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,278
the drink.

191
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,823
So, a drink without

192
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,823
alcohol in it is wrong?

193
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,200
Yep.

194
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,285
Italian people,

195
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,285
they know what's up.

196
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,285
(sighs)

197
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,122
All right, one issue

198
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,122
at a time.

199
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:52,584
So, you're really gonna date

200
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:52,584
two men simultaneously?

201
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,336
Two that you know of.

202
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,336
Oh, Mom.

203
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,464
Come on, don't be

204
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,464
such a prude.

205
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,007
I'm not gonna have

206
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,007
any babies.

207
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,842
I don't need these men

208
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,842
to take care of me.

209
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,095
Why shouldn't I just

210
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,095
enjoy myself?

211
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,597
Well, it isn't very

212
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,597
Christian of you.

213
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,557
I got no argument there.

214
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,518
Salute!

215
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,518
(chuckles)

216
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,937
(sighs)

217
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,189
Yeah, that fixed it.

218
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,315
Mmm.

219
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,609
♪ ♪

220
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,954
Oh, Meemaw, no.

221
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,127
Hey, who are you calling?

222
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,878
Dr. Sturgis.

223
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,921
Why?

224
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,881
I saw Meemaw get in a car

225
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,675
with Mr. Rosenbloom.

226
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:45,595
(distorted):

227
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:45,595
No...

228
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,808
ADULT SHELDON:<i> I don't know</i>

229
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,808
<i>if it really happened this way,</i>

230
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,685
<i>but to my nine-year-old mind,</i>

231
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,145
<i>my mother was flying.</i>

232
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,818
(country music playing)

233
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,696
So, how's the brisket?

234
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,989
It's good.

235
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,117
It ain't my brisket,

236
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,117
but it's good.

237
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,827
I should take you

238
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,827
to New York

239
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,829
so you could taste some

240
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,829
authentic Jewish brisket.

241
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,080
How's it different?

242
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,623
Well, it's pretty much

243
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,623
the same except

244
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,084
it's-it's a lot juicier

245
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,084
and you can feel the fat

246
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,418
go directly to your heart.

247
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,586
(both laughing)

248
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,089
Oh, boy...

249
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,465
I miss that laugh.

250
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,053
So, uh...

251
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,679
what do you think

252
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,679
of that idea?

253
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,557
What idea?

254
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,557
Going to New York.

255
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,475
Maybe we'll catch

256
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,475
a couple of Broadway shows,

257
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,393
uh, see some sights.

258
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:38,982
Oh, Ira, gee...

259
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,608
I don't know.

260
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,608
(chuckles)

261
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,278
Seems like a big step.

262
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,278
Is it?

263
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,946
I think at this time

264
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,946
of our lives,

265
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,074
we should travel,

266
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,074
see the world.

267
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,783
I guess.

268
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,783
I mean,

269
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,285
we're not getting

270
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,285
any younger.

271
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,371
What's that supposed to mean?

272
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,914
(stammers)

273
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,250
I mean, I mean,<i> I'm</i> not

274
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,250
getting any younger.

275
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,625
You, on the other hand,

276
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,254
you are a blossoming tulip.

277
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,629
Better.

278
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,341
SHELDON:

279
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,341
<i>But I still don't understand.</i>

280
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,344
Your grandmother's

281
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,344
a single lady.

282
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:09,346
She's not committed

283
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:09,346
to any one fella,

284
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,306
and she wants to see

285
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,306
what her options are.

286
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,558
But Dr. Sturgis is

287
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,558
the best option.

288
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,476
Well, you might

289
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,476
feel that way,

290
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,853
but she's not so sure.

291
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,813
Then we need to tell her.

292
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,813
I'll make the call.

293
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,815
No. We need to

294
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,815
mind our business

295
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,818
and maybe pray for her

296
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,818
to make the right decision.

297
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,529
We're gonna leave this

298
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,529
up to God?

299
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,032
You think you could do

300
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,032
a better job than God?

301
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,076
Maybe not with

302
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,076
creating the universe,

303
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,493
but I bet

304
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,493
I could free the Hebrews

305
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,912
with one good plague.

306
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,914
IRA:

307
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,914
<i>You can get lox, bagels,</i>

308
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,917
all the trimmings

309
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,917
at 3:30 in the morning.

310
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,336
(chuckles)

311
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,336
Why would I want that?

312
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,131
Well, you wouldn't.

313
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,131
I mean, it's too heavy.

314
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,382
But you could

315
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,382
if you wanted.

316
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:46,425
(chuckles)

317
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,634
So, what do you think?

318
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,762
Oh, Ira, I don't think so.

319
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,139
All right, what do you say

320
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,308
to a weekend

321
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,308
in New Orleans, huh?

322
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,934
We could do one of those

323
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,934
Carnival Cruise things.

324
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,561
You're killing me.

325
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,561
(laughs)

326
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,687
I can't do this, I...

327
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,731
Can't do what?

328
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:05,026
Ira, you're just

329
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:05,026
a wonderful man.

330
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,821
Oh, boy, I don't like

331
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,821
where this is going.

332
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,281
But to tell you the truth,

333
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,199
I'm seeing somebody else.

334
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,243
And we've gone there.

335
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:16,121
I thought I could do it, uh...

336
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:16,121
you know, date both of you,

337
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,706
but I-I can't, I can't,

338
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,706
I just...

339
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,541
I'm not cut out for it.

340
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,794
Okay, suggestion.

341
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,172
And maybe you've already

342
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,172
thought of this...

343
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,798
but what do you say

344
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,798
you break up with him

345
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,049
and only see me?

346
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,509
(chuckles)

347
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,511
(sobbing)

348
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,764
I'm sorry.

349
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,225
I thought I could

350
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,225
handle this.

351
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,019
It's okay.

352
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,019
You know,

353
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,063
you get older, and you think

354
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,063
your skin is thicker...

355
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,149
It's okay.

356
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,149
...and your heart

357
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,149
is tougher.

358
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,194
But it's not, it's

359
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,194
the other way around.

360
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:51,572
I hope this guy knows

361
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:51,572
what a gift he has in you.

362
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,367
Well, "gift" is a strong word,

363
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,618
but he's enthusiastic.

364
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,828
Good.

365
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,248
May you both be

366
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,248
very happy together!

367
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,504
I don't want to

368
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,504
celebrate too soon,

369
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,757
but Meemaw and Mr. Rosenbloom

370
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,757
are back, and he was crying.

371
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,926
(indistinct chatter on TV)

372
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,138
There'll be more updates

373
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,138
as they happen.

374
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,481
I'm done.

375
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:25,606
Can I please be excused?

376
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,817
Good Lord, did you

377
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,817
even chew it?

378
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,361
Not the recommended amount, no.

379
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,820
What's your hurry?

380
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,780
I need to get back

381
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,780
to my viewing post.

382
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,200
Fine, go ahead.

383
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,454
What's he expect to see,

384
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,454
staring at Meemaw's house?

385
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,664
(sighs)

386
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,664
Did you just join

387
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,664
this family?

388
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,166
The kid's an oddball.

389
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,335
He's just excited

390
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,335
that Meemaw's dating

391
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:46,836
a man he looks up to.

392
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,339
I wish she could date

393
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,339
Tony Danza-- that'd be cool.

394
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,591
What is it with you

395
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,591
and Tony Danza?

396
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,219
Well, the show doesn't

397
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,219
come out and say it,

398
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,637
but I'm pretty sure

399
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,637
he's the boss.

400
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,433
I think the blonde

401
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,433
lady's the boss.

402
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,517
Angela?

403
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,394
Who's the oddball now?

404
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,523
I'm warning you,

405
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,691
once you try my barbecue,

406
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,570
it will ruin you

407
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,570
to all the others.

408
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,697
That's what happened to me

409
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,697
with quilted toilet paper.

410
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,450
Once I tried the good stuff,

411
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,119
everything else felt

412
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,119
like a Brillo pad.

413
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,996
You paint quite the picture,

414
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,996
don't you?

415
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,582
(doorbell ringing)

416
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,166
Oh, gosh.

417
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,960
Excuse me.

418
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,838
Sheldon,

419
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,838
this is not cute anymore.

420
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,634
Connie Tucker?

421
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,634
Yes?

422
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,344
I have a dinette set

423
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,344
from Rosenbloom's Furniture.

424
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,345
Oh.

425
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,805
I didn't buy any furniture.

426
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,974
I think it's a gift.

427
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,310
Oh, boy.

428
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,103
TONY:

429
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,103
I bent down to pick up a book,

430
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,482
and I'll be darned if she didn't

431
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,482
sneak a look at my derriere.

432
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,650
(laughter on TV)

433
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,650
Oh, man.

434
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:54,362
You won't believe what's

435
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:54,362
happening at Meemaw's house.

436
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,823
Is it more interesting

437
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,823
than<i> Who's the Boss?</i>

438
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,617
Doubt it.

439
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,660
(phone rings)

440
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,954
Rosenbloom's Fine Furniture.

441
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,954
Ira speaking.

442
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,956
Why are you sending me

443
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,956
furniture?

444
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:08,084
I've decided

445
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:08,084
I can't go away quietly.

446
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,086
I'm fighting for your love.

447
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,879
With a dinette set?

448
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,923
Oh, this isn't just any dinette

449
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,923
set. It's our biggest seller.

450
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,176
And it's not pressed wood--

451
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,636
it's oak!

452
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:20,180
Ira, I don't like this.

453
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,890
Would you prefer

454
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,890
a leather sectional?

455
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,726
Uh, what's going on?

456
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,726
(chuckles)

457
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,270
Uh,

458
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,938
can I call you back?

459
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,524
I look forward to it.

460
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,233
You shouldn't.

461
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,196
Okay.

462
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,156
I guess

463
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,156
you could say

464
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,866
one of my former boyfriends

465
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,452
is trying to win me back

466
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,452
with furniture.

467
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:45,163
Huh. Impressive.

468
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,040
This is real oak.

469
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,459
Was that him

470
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,459
on the phone?

471
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,461
Yes. I'm sorry.

472
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,297
Interesting.

473
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,923
What?

474
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,426
Being challenged by another man

475
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,888
is making you more

476
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,888
attractive to me.

477
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,682
I don't follow.

478
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,724
I'll have to do

479
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,724
some research,

480
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,728
but I'm guessing

481
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,728
this is a genetic instinct

482
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,732
that's raising my libido.

483
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,319
(chuckling):

484
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,319
I need a drink.

485
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,991
Can you believe he tried to win

486
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,991
me back with a dinette set?

487
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,118
I'd give you a dinette set

488
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,118
if you'd leave Texas.

489
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,329
So, would you return it?

490
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,997
Hell no, I'm keeping it.

491
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,583
But then you'll be

492
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,583
beholden to him.

493
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,167
(sighs)

494
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,960
Would you ever take Ira back?

495
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:33,961
I don't know.

496
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,215
He's sweet as he can be, but...

497
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,093
there's just something

498
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,093
about John.

499
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,721
He's like a cute

500
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,721
little teddy bear, you know?

501
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,013
A brilliant,

502
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,432
bicycle-riding

503
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,183
teddy bear.

504
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,227
I don't even understand half

505
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,227
of what he says.

506
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,187
But...

507
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:55,066
when he's not around,

508
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:55,066
I just miss him.

509
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,861
Sounds like you're

510
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,861
falling in love.

511
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,948
Maybe I am.

512
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,158
Excellent.

513
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,158
I love him, too.

514
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,535
Get out of here!

515
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,161
If you don't understand

516
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,161
what Dr. Sturgis says,

517
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,455
I'm happy

518
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,455
to explain it to you.

519
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,956
Get!

520
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,003
STURGIS:

521
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,003
Excuse me.

522
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,422
I'm looking for Ira.

523
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,215
At your service.

524
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,215
What can I do for you?

525
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:22,636
You, sir,

526
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:22,636
have overstepped your bounds.

527
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,387
(chuckles)

528
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,387
I'm sorry, what?

529
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,888
Miss Constance Tucker

530
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,434
made it clear your courtship

531
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,434
was no longer welcome,

532
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,312
and you responded

533
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,312
with six chairs,

534
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,565
a table, and an expansion leaf.

535
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,317
Who are you?

536
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,901
John Sturgis,

537
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,528
the man she chose

538
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,405
and your romantic rival.

539
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,074
I-I'm sorry, wait, what-what

540
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,074
is it you want from me?

541
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:48,202
I want you to give up

542
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:48,202
your pursuit of Connie.

543
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,913
All right, I'm gonna have

544
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,913
to ask you to leave my store.

545
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,832
Very well.

546
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,835
The line in the sand

547
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,835
has been drawn.

548
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,798
Cross it at your own peril.

549
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,887
(quietly):

550
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,887
Weirdo.

551
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,564
What was that?

552
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:17,816
You heard me.

553
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:21,402
Sir, I am a man with feelings.

554
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,156
And you have hurt them.

555
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,202
I know you've had

556
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,202
a number of...

557
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,204
gentleman callers,

558
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,832
but I've never heard you

559
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,832
speak like this before.

560
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,542
"Gentleman callers"?

561
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,959
And we wonder where

562
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,959
Sheldon gets it.

563
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,419
(laughs)

564
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,754
I'm sorry y'all find this funny,

565
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,172
but this is the first time

566
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,550
my mother's expressed

567
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,550
real interest in a man

568
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,925
since Dad died.

569
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,053
Forgive me for

570
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,053
wanting to know more.

571
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,889
You really want to know more?

572
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,477
Imagine you're getting on

573
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,477
in years,

574
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,437
you and your husband

575
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,437
about to retire,

576
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,523
get a little timeshare

577
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,523
in Sarasota,

578
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,526
and... suddenly...

579
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,653
he's gone,

580
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,988
and you're all alone.

581
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,449
You mourn, you cry,

582
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:12,078
but eventually you move on.

583
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,205
You start dating a little,

584
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,791
and it's all good fun.

585
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,043
But always in the back

586
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,043
of your mind,

587
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,547
there's that question...

588
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,885
"Will I be alone in the end?"

589
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,306
(sniffles)

590
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,517
Why y'all looking at me for?

591
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,019
(sniffling)

592
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,521
Haven't slept in days.

593
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,356
It's like I'm

594
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,356
a lovesick teenager,

595
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:43,693
except I remember the

596
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:43,693
Truman administration.

597
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:43,693
(chuckles)

598
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,279
Your feelings

599
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,279
are understandable.

600
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,197
Connie is

601
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,197
a remarkable woman.

602
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,908
Yes, she is.

603
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,326
But, again, I'm sorry. I should

604
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,326
never have called you weird.

605
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,621
I mean, eh, it was rude.

606
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,873
I've been called

607
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,873
much worse.

608
00:15:56,915 --> 00:16:01,210
A professor once called me

609
00:15:56,915 --> 00:16:01,210
ostrobogulous.

610
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,837
I had to look that one up.

611
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,171
What's it mean?

612
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,423
That I'm a weirdo.

613
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,591
(laughs)

614
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,218
John, you're a great guy.

615
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,428
Well, you, too!

616
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,513
But I hope you

617
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,513
understand, I just...

618
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:13,932
I can't give up on Connie.

619
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,476
That's all right.

620
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,476
To tell you the truth,

621
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:20,647
I'm finding the competition

622
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:20,647
quite exhilarating.

623
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,731
You are?

624
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,274
Oh, yes.

625
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,526
The night

626
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,526
the dinette set arrived,

627
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:29,113
I did my first push-up

628
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:29,113
in 40 years.

629
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,115
(laughs, snorts)

630
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,242
I'm sorry, but I find

631
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,242
that to be, uh--

632
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,578
what's the word--

633
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,578
astro-boobulous?

634
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,080
Ostrobogulous.

635
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,165
Ostrobogulous.

636
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,959
Exactly.

637
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,878
Now, give me your best price

638
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,421
on one of these

639
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,048
with a cup holder.

640
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,849
John! What

641
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,849
a pleasant surprise.

642
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,017
I have some news for you.

643
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,017
Oh?

644
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,102
Mwah. What is that?

645
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,102
Mwah.

646
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:03,189
I went to the furniture

647
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:03,189
store and spoke to Ira.

648
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,192
Why would you do that?

649
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,192
To demand

650
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,278
that he respect your

651
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,278
wish to be left alone.

652
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:13,825
John, it was not

653
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:13,825
your place to do that.

654
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,160
Well, if it helps,

655
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,746
he doesn't plan on

656
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,746
leaving you alone.

657
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:28,255
What the hell

658
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:28,255
were you thinking?!

659
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,924
That I was being chivalrous.

660
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,968
By going behind my back?

661
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,303
You seem upset.

662
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,055
I am upset!

663
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,766
And how I handle Ira

664
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,766
is my business!

665
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,185
Well, I hope you do it gently.

666
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,729
He's very vulnerable these days.

667
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,564
You're friends now?

668
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,273
Well, I wouldn't say friends,

669
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,234
but I could see, over time,

670
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,443
you know,

671
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,443
we might...

672
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,820
Are you two fighting?

673
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,406
No.

674
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,866
Oh, good.

675
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,866
(chuckles)

676
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,201
I was almost certain

677
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,201
that we were.

678
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,118
We are.

679
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,787
I'm confused.

680
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,787
Me, too.

681
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,956
Is this because you went

682
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,956
to the furniture store?

683
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,082
He knows about this?

684
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,792
Yes.

685
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,792
Yes.

686
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,792
All right, now, listen,

687
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,086
if this relationship's

688
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,086
gonna have any chance at all,

689
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,796
we have to lay down

690
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,796
some ground rules.

691
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,172
Great. I love rules.

692
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,632
I do, too.

693
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,760
I don't want you talking to him

694
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,760
about anything

695
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,094
having to do

696
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,094
with anything about us.

697
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,095
Same with you.

698
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,346
And I want you

699
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,346
to stop

700
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,348
spying on me

701
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,348
with those binoculars

702
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,559
like you're on some kind

703
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,559
of African safari.

704
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,143
And you cannot talk

705
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,814
to Ira or any of my

706
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,814
ex-boyfriends, for that matter.

707
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,733
This list is getting long.

708
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,484
Maybe we should write it down.

709
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,028
Hey.

710
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,363
ADULT SHELDON:

711
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,363
<i>In that moment,</i>

712
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,240
<i>I had an epiphany.</i>

713
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:40,954
<i>I could draw up a contract</i>

714
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:40,954
<i>for any social relationship.</i>

715
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,496
(whirring)

716
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,165
<i>It was a helpful way</i>

717
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,165
<i>to remove ambiguity</i>

718

<i>to understand.</i>

720
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,462
Article three--

721
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,672
Sheldon will not spy

722
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:55,051
on Meemaw's house

723
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:55,051
with binoculars.

724
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,636
Type that one in bold.

725
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,930

Please sign and date.

728
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,567
You know, Sheldon,

729
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,567
I'm a notary, if that helps.

730
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,736
Just when I thought

731
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,736
you couldn't get cooler.

732
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,989
ADULT SHELDON:

733
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,989
<i>I would go on</i>

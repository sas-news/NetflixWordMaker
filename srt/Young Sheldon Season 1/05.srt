Gotta.

21
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:31,031
Statistically, always

punting on fourth down

23
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,198
makes no sense.

24
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,201
Statistically,

25
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,201

Hey.

27
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,537
When the Aggies give up the ball

28
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,163

29
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:41,291
the opposing team has

30
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:41,291
a 92% chance of scoring.

31
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,169
When they punt from deep

32
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,169
in their own territory,

33
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,714
the other team still has

34
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,714
a 77% chance of scoring.

35
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,924
But since they convert

36
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,385
on fourth down 50% of the time,

37
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,889
the math says they should

38
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,889
never punt again.

00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,308
who might win the

197
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,308
Cowboys-Packers game next week?

198
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,686
And, more specifically,

199
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,686
by how much?

200
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:56,815
I suppose with enough data

201
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:56,815
I could make a reasonable guess.

202
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,151
I don't want a guess,

203
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,151
I want to know.

204
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,694
Mom said you're not

205
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,694
supposed to gamble.

206
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,403
Sleep, child!

207
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,239
MARY: Mom?

208
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,239
In here!

209
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,117
(whispers): I'll get those

210
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,117
numbers to you tomorrow.

211
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:10,078
Just tucking him in.

212
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:10,078
(chuckles)

213
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,333
I got something for you.

214
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:17,211
It's dirty.

215
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,462
Well, that's 'cause

216
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,462
it's the game ball.

217
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:23,091
And you earned it,

218
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:23,091
'cause you helped us win.

219
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,093
Okay, but can you wash it?

220
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,722
Sheldon, your daddy's

221
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,722
telling you he's proud of you.

222
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,725
I see. Thank you, Dad.

223
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,810
You're welcome.

224
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,190
I'm still never touching that.

225
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,692
Let's go wipe it off.

226
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,447

all over for you.

Yeah.

259

I put the word out I was helping

I was touched 82 times

267

this afternoon.

268
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,386
What do you mean, "touched"?

269
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:50,720
Not inappropriately.

270
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,139
Joyfully.

271
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,807
Affectionately.

272
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,143

274
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,727
That's amazing.

275

No more high fives.

00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,149
I can't keep

277
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,149

Hello, Dad.

282
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,788
You have any more,

283
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,788
uh, arithmetic ideas

284
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,248
for next week's game?

285
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,792
I do, but I'm trying

286
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,792
to finish my homework.

287
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,837
Ah.

288
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,341
Looks complicated.

289
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,760
Advanced chemistry.

290
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,760
It's not.

291
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,511
What are you guys doing?

292
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,472
Your brother and I are gonna

293
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,472
knock around a few ideas

294
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,015
for the Freeport game.

295
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,517
Can I help?

296
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,686
Actually, yeah.

297
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,686
Run out to my truck.

298
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,270
There's a little, uh,

299
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,270
pocket calculator

300
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,188
on my front seat.

301
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,690
I got you a present.

302
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,859
Thought it might help

303
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,859
with your figuring.

304
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,528
I don't need a calculator, Dad.

305
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,528
I am one.

306
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,737
Sure.

307
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,614
Well...

308
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,074
Go get it anyway.

309
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,161
It's solar-powered.

310
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,205
(chuckles):

311
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,205
Can you imagine that?

312
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,631
(rock music playing loudly

313
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,631

314
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,718
(steady thumping)

315
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,142
Georgie, turn that down!

316
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,810
What?

317
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,647
(music stops)

318
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,108
And look at this room.

319
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,108
You need to clean this mess up.

320
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,902
I'll get to it later.

321
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,237
No, you'll get to it now.

322
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,863
I don't feel like it.

323
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,115
Well, your feelings have

324
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,115
nothing to do with it.

325
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,575
And stop throwing that ball.

326
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,203
My room bothers you so much,

327
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,203
you clean it.

328
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,582
MARY: That's it!

329
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,582
You are grounded! You hear me?!

330
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,042
The hell?

331
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,587
Hey...!

332
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,548
There's my little Moonpie.

333
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,092
Did you get a chance to look

334
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,092
at this week's games for me?

335
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,053
Not yet.

336
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,053
You understand there's

337
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,053
a little time crunch involved.

338
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:59,224
Meemaw's got some outstanding

339
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:59,224
loans I need to pay back.

340
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,309
I'm sorry,

341
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,309
I have to finish my homework

342
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,270
and then I have to help my dad.

343
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,980
Come on.

344
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,774
I'm your meemaw.

345
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,317
I make you cookies.

346
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,027
How 'bout a little quid pro quo?

347
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,279
As much as I enjoy

348
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,697
your use of Latin, no.

349
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,617
Shelly, time to get ready

350
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,617
for bed.

351
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,910
But I'm not done.

352
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,495
Don't you sass me, too,

353
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,495
young man.

354
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,080
Brush your teeth and get to bed.

355
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,379
I think your anger might be

356
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,379
a little misdirected.

357
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,172
Don't you start

358
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,172
with me either.

359
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:34,134
Now, see,

360
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:34,134
you're still shootin' wide.

361
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,975
(knocking)

362
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,894
Good evening,

363
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,894
Mrs. Cooper.

364
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,187
Can I speak to Sheldon?

365
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,355
No, you can't speak to Sheldon.

366
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,149
It's late. He's in bed.

367
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,402
Oh. I was hoping he might like

368
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,402
to go to a party with me.

369
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,404
Has everyone lost their mind?

370
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,615
He's a little boy, Tam!

371
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,492
Good night!

372
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,492
But...

373
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:02,621
Good Lord, that mouth of yours

374
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:02,621
is a machine gun tonight.

375
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,044
What are you doing?

376
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,172
Trying to calculate

377
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,172
the odds of the Dolphins

378
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,591
covering the spread next Sunday.

379
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,092
I like dolphins.

380
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,845
They talk out of that hole

381
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,845
in their head.

382
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,388
(knocking)

383
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,348
Hello.

384
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,932
Tam?

385
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,020
What are you doing here?

386
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,855
Would you like to go

387
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,855
to a party with me?

388
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,773
I don't want to go to a party

389
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,773
with anyone.

390
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,608
I would!

391
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,733
Please, Sheldon.

392
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,235
It's right across the street.

393
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,363
Just get me in,

394
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,363
and you can go back to bed.

395
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,198
I have to ask my mom.

396
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,117
No need.

397
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,117
She knows all about the party.

398
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,994
All right, then.

399
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,372
I need a minute

400
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,372
to change.

401
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,627
Why are you wearing that?

402
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,627
It makes me look older.

403
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,171
(doorbell rings)

404
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,171
Just so we're clear,

405
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,171
once you get in,

406
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,215
I'm going home.

407
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,633
Hey! Sheldon!

408
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,885
What are you doing?

409
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,555
Hey, everybody, check it out!

410
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,555
Sheldon's here!

411
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,555
(crowd cheering)

412
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:05,058
(cheering continues in distance)

413
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,394
I hope that doesn't

414
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,394
wake up the kids.

415
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,312
Should I go over there

416
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,312
and say something?

417
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,480
I think you should.

418
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,065
(sighs)

419
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,650
I was bluffin'.

420
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,069
Don't make me

421
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,069
put my socks back on.

422
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,820
Never mind.

423
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,531
Good night.

424
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,616
Good night.

425
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,918
I feel bad about

426
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,918
yelling at Georgie.

427
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,920
He deserved it.

428
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,505
You should do it more.

429
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,424
I think he's feeling left out

430
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,134
now that you and Sheldon are

431
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,134
spending so much time together.

432
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,723
Are you kiddin' me?

433
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,723
You're always saying to find

434
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,933
something in common

435
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,933
with Sheldon.

436
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,767
And now that I have, you're

437
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,767
telling me I'm ignoring Georgie?

438
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,562
I'm not saying that.

439
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,564
I'm just reminding you

440
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,357
that you got two sons.

441
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,359
I know.

442
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,819
I also got a daughter

443
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,819
I need to spend more time with.

444
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,154
You do.

445
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,240
But I wouldn't worry about her.

446
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,825
She's an angel.

447
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,036

Sheldon! Sheldon! Sheldon!

451
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,377
Put me down!

452
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,377

454
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,379
I'm not enjoying this!

455
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,880
Missy, what are you doing here?!

456
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,924
Cuttin' loose.

457
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,924
What are you doing here?

458
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:20,925
SHELDON:

459
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:20,925
Slowly! Slowly!

460
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,720
Slowly!

461
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:24,971
You, too?!

462
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,431
Hello, Georgie!

463
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,057
You're not supposed

464
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,057
to be here.

465
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,477
Neither are you!

466
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,477
You're grounded!

467
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,520
Come on.

468
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,272
Both of you are going home. Now.

469
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,441
Oh, thank goodness.

470
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,441
Aw.

471
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,362
How's puberty

472
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,362
treating you?

473
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:44,157
Because it is

474
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:44,157
knocking me for a loop.

475
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,410
Right?

476
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,209
ADULT SHELDON:<i> Somehow,</i>

477
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,209

479
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,421

<i>In my exhaustion,</i>

485
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,638

<i>forgot to show my work.</i>

489
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,229
I just saw one of those girls

490
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,229
from the party,

491
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,940
and she acknowledged

492
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,940
my existence by doing this.

493
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,110
I've never felt so alive.

494
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,905
Are you okay?

495
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,949
No, I'm not.

496
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,829
Yeah, so?

497
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,540
A B-plus-- that's

498
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,540
the beginning of the end.

499
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,749
The end of what?

500
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,751
My life.

501
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,420
If I don't make some changes,

502
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,420
who knows how far I'll fall.

503
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:43,090
I could wind up a drug addict,

504
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:43,090
or a lawyer.

505
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,884
Is it possible

506
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,884
you're overreacting?

507
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:48,929
No. Starting today, I'm done

508
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:48,929
helping the football team.

509
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,933
But if you do that, girls will

510
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,933
no longer greet me like this.

511
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,187
I'll greet you like that.

512
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,815

Oilers are a four-point favorite

562
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,999

00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,115
come on. Damn it!

580
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:14,367
Okay.

581
00:17:14,407 --> 00:17:16,953
One more time.

582
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:20,164
Mama needs a new Jet Ski!

583
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,499
And...

584
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,459
rat bastard!

585
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:26,546
How you doin' there, Connie?

586
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,757
Hey, Vincent.

587
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,757
(chuckles)

588
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,551
What brings you

589
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,551
to Louisiana?

590
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,802
Wait, don't tell me.

591
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:34,428
You're here to see Tony Orlando.

592
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,389
'Fraid not.

593
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,974
Oh, well, you ought

594
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,974
to check him out.

595
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,976
He'll, uh, knock your socks off.

596
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,936
I like my socks on.

597
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:45,648
Connie, you're putting me

598
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:45,648
in a very awkward position.

599
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,275
I won a toaster oven

600
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,275
playing keno.

601
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,736
You want it?

602
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,572
I got one.

603
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,198
I want my money.

604
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,950
(chuckles):

605
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,950
All right.

606
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,577
Hang on.

607
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,997
That's a very nice jacket.

608
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,416
You're looking dapper.

609
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,754
Ah. (chuckles)

610
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,129
Hey, they comp my room here.

611
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,548
They do that for you?

612
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,052
Actually, they frown

613
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,052
upon my presence here.

614
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,471
Oh. I also get a coupon

615
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,471
for the breakfast buffet.

616
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,432
You should look into that.

617
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,269
(sighs, mutters)

618
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,437
Constance!

619
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,564
Patience, Vincenzo.

620
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,149
(chuckles)

621
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,153
(bell ringing)

622
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,153
Yes! (laughing)

623
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,406
(coins clacking)

624
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,406
Oh!

625
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,241
All right, now we're talking.

626
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,535
Will you take a down payment

627
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,535
in quarters?

628
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,870
Do I have a choice?

629
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,162
(laughs)

630
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,664
Start scoopin'.

631
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,541
I got to go see Tony Orlando.

632
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,460
(coins continue clacking)

633
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,799
Oof.

634
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,925
(shudders)

635
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,303
(exasperated grunt)

636
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,389
(yells)

637
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:01,515
(coins continue clacking)

638
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,059
Hey!

639
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,478
Hey, I need another cup!

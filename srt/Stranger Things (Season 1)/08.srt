[Joyce yelling] Let me out of here!

3
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,610
Somebody, please!

[grunts]

5
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,824
Let me out!

[door unlocking]

7
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,955
[Joyce breathing heavily]

8
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,637
[Dr. Brenner] Your son.

9
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,932
We know you've been in contact with him.

10
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,063
-[stammering] You have to let me--
-When...

11
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,775
and how did you make contact with him?

12
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,569
-What?
-Hmm?

13
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,864
Six.

14
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,241
What?

15
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,869
Six.

16
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,165
Six people have been taken this week.

17
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,795
This... thing that took your son...

18
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,840
[softly] we don't really understand it.

19
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,426
But its behavior is predictable.

20
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,597
Like all animals...

21
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:40,934
it eats.

22
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,187
It will take more sons.

23
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,272
More daughters.

24
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,942
I want to save them.

25
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,487
I want to save your son.

26
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,156
But I can't do that.

27
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,325
Not without your help.

28
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,618
Stop.

29
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,290
I know who you are.

30
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,835
I know what you've done.

31
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:11,131
You took my boy away from me!

32
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,968
You left him in that place to die!

33
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,053
You faked his death!

34
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,265
We had a funeral.

35
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,725
We buried him.

36
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,896
And now you're asking for my help?

37
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,569
Go to hell.

38
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,196
-[electricity crackling]
-[groaning]

39
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,119
-[breathing heavily]
-Okay, now what do you know?

40
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,787
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,873
Did I stutter?

42
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,001
I told you.

43
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,460
Everything.

44
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,879
[electricity crackling]

45
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,133
What do you know?

46
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,718
[panting]

47
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,137
I know you do experiments
on kidnapped little kids,

48
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,598
whose parents' brains
you've turned to mush.

49
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,267
And I know you went
a little too far this time

50
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,269
and you messed up in a big way.

51
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,398
I mean, you really messed up,
didn't you? Big time.

52
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,400
That's why you're trying
to cover your tracks.

53
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,446
You killed Benny Hammond,
you faked Will Byers' death.

54
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,948
You made it look like
that little girl just ran away.

55
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,450
See, I told you.

56
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,120
-I know everything.
-All right, who are you working with?

57
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,414
Nobody.

58
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,666
But I did give all this
over to my friend at the <i>Times.</i>

59
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,460
He's gonna blow this thing wide open.
[chuckles]

[grunting]

62
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,929
You're just a junkie.

63
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,724
A small town cop
who had a really bad week.

64
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,060
Took one too many pills this time.

65
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,941
You made a mistake coming back here.

66
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,609
No, I didn't.

67
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,946
Here's what's gonna happen.

68
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,574
You're gonna let me and Joyce Byers go...

69
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,869
you're gonna give us anything we need,

70
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,996
and we're gonna find her son.

71
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,793
And then we're gonna forget
that any of this ever happened.

72
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,003
Oh, is that right?

73
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,589
Yeah.

74
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:19,759
That's right.

75
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,483
Nancy? Jonathan?

76
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,489
[door closes]

77
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,450
-They're gone.
-What?

78
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,827
Nancy and Jonathan.
His car's gone.

79
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,453
They're probably
just sucking face somewhere.

80
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,455
-[Lucas] Gross.
-No. No way!

81
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,623
Did they go with the chief?

82
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,708
I don't know.

83
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,418
No.

84
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,796
What? Did you see them?
Do you know where they went?

85
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,091
-Yes.
-Where? Where did they go?

86
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,220
Demogorgon.

87
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,884
[sighs]

88
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,871
Where's the girl?

89
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,208
[inhales deeply]

90
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,585
[exhales]

91
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,339
You gotta give me your word.

92
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,426
Nobody's ever gonna find out about this.

93
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:12,181
And those other three kids, those boys,
you're gonna leave them alone.

94
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,310
Then I'll tell you.

95
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,607
Tell you where
your little science experiment is.

96
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,367
[sighs]

97
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,375
[gasps]

98
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,134
I don't understand.

99
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,886
We came to an agreement.

100
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,554
What?

101
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,182
Look, everything that's happened here
and everything that's gonna happen,

102
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,683
we don't talk about.

103
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,976
You want Will back?

104
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,687
This place had nothing to do with it.

105
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,316
That's the deal.
You got it?

106
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,243
What is this?

107
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,163
Protection.
The atmosphere is toxic.

108
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,624
[stutters] But my son's in there. He...

109
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,833
Put it on.

110
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,600
[Connie] I'm telling you,
this is a mistake.

111
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,727
[Dr. Brenner] It's gone.
Isn't that what you wanted?

112
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,562
And if they find the boy?

113
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:43,231
That's not gonna happen.

114
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,881

[Hopper] Hey, you all right?

118
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,539
[Joyce] Yeah.

119
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,291
[Hopper echoing]
I need you to relax, okay?

120
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,795
I want you to slow down your breathing,
take deep breaths.

121
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,963
In and out.

122
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,758
Deep breath in...

123
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,843
and out.

124
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,472
In and out.

-It's troll's favorite food!

-Whoa.

-What happened? What happened?
-I don't know. I don't know.

134

00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,163
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

-Relax, relax. Honey, honey.
-[panting]

137

Honey, just breathe.

-You okay?
-[breathing heavily] Yeah.

143
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,972
Yeah.

-Straight into Will's room. And--
-Don't step on the trap.

146

Wait for the yo-yo to move.

Then...

148
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,586
All right.

149
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,504
You ready?

150
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,299
Ready.

151
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,510

You don't have to do this--

155
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,560
Jonathan, stop talking.

156
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,811
-I'm just saying, you don't have to--
-Three.

[Mike] Guys, guys! This is crazy.

158
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,900
We can't just wait around.

159
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,277
Mike, in case you forgot,
we're still fugitives.

160
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,737
The bad men are still looking for us.

161
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,697
Yeah, and we don't even know
where your sister is.

162
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,781
El can find them.

163
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:03,866
Mike, look at her.

164
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,619
I still think we should stick
to the chief's plan.

165
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:10,289
Exactly. We stay here,
keep El out of sight and keep her safe.

166
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,166
That's the most important thing, remember?

167
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,168
Besides, she's okay.
She's with Jonathan.

168
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,670
Yeah, and she's kind of
a badass now, so...

169
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,049
Well, where are you going?
You just said stick to the plan!

170
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,510
I am. I'm just gonna go get
some chocolate pudding.

171
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,678
I'm telling you,
Lunch Lady Phyllis hoards that shit.

172
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,013
[Mike] Are you serious?

173
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,765
El needs to be recharged!

Did you hear that?

It's just the wind.

179
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,382
Don't worry.

180
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,802
My mom, she said the lights speak
when it comes.

181
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:05,970
Speak?

182
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,097
Blink.

183
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,266
Think of them as alarms.

184
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,818
Is that too tight?

185
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,195
[stutters] No, it's fine.

186
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,488
Thanks.

187
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,042
Nancy?

188
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,504
Yeah?

189
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,340
-[banging on door]
-[both gasp]

190
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,468
[Steve] Jonathan?

191
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,888
Are you there, man?
It's... it's Steve!

192
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,473
Listen, I just want to talk!

193
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,766
[banging on door continues]

194
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,186
-Steve, listen to me.
-Hey. Nancy, what--

195
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,689
-You need to leave.
-I'm not trying to start anything, okay?

196
00:14:58,772 --> 00:14:59,940
I don't care about that.
You need to leave.

197
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,360
[stammering] No, no, no.
Listen, I messed up, okay?

198
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,112
I messed... I messed up.

199
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,196
Okay?

200
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,032
Really. Please.

201
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,658
I just want to make things right.

202
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,037
Okay? Please. Please...

203
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,164
[stammers]

204
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,540
Hey, what happened to your hand?

205
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,875
Is that blood?

206
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,710
Nothing.
[stutters] It was an accident.

207
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,670
-Yeah, what's going on?
-Nothing.

208
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,547
-Wait a sec. Did he do this to you?
-No.

209
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,925
-Nancy, let me in!
-No. No! No, Steve!

210
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,969
-What is... What the...
-You need to get out of here.

211
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,846
-Whoa. What is all--
-Listen to me. I'm not asking you,

212
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,473
-I'm telling you, get out of here!
-What is that smell?

213
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,974
-Is that... is that gasoline?
-Steve, get out!

214
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,769
[stutters] Wait.
What? What is going on?

215
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,145
You have five seconds
to get out of here.

216
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,647
Okay, is this a joke?
Stop. Put the gun down.

217
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,523
-I'm doing this for you.
-Nancy.

218
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,775
-Wait. Is this a... What is this?
-Nancy.

219
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,860
-Three. Two.
-No, no, no! No, no!

220
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,654
Nancy! The lights.

221
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,531
-It's here.
-[Steve] Wait, what's here?

222
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,616
-[Nancy] Where is it?
-Where is what? Whoa!

223
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,201
-Easy with that!
-Where is it?

224
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,369
I don't know.
I don't see it.

225
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,453
Where is what?

226
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,289
Hello? Will someone please explain to me
what the hell is going--

227
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,419
-[monster roars]
-[Jonathan] No!

228
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,922
Go! Go! Run! Go!

229
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,340
[Jonathan] Get out of here!

230
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,801
[growls]

231
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,387
[Jonathan] Jump!
[Steve] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

232
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,890
Jesus! Jesus! What the hell was that?

233
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,392
-What the hell was that?
-[both] Shut up!

234
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,227
[monster screeching]

235
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,354
[all panting]

236
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,317
[Nancy] What's it doing?

237
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,528
I don't know.

238
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,619
[electricity jolts]

239
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,584
Do you hear anything?

240
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,545
No.

241
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,838
[door opening]

242
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,228
[Joyce echoing] Will!

243
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,813
Will!

244
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,691
[breathing heavily]

245
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,612
Will!

246
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,701
Will!

247
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,000
[indistinct sobbing]

248
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,591
[Hopper] "I asked Mrs. Spencer what made
them red and she said she didn't know

249
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,551
and for pity's sake
not to ask her any more questions.

250
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,428
She said I must have asked her
a thousand already.

251
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,638
I suppose I had, too,

252
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:20,724
but how are you gonna find things out
if you don't ask questions?

253
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,684
And what does make roads red?

254
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,520
'Well, I don't know,' said Matthew.

255
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,231
It just makes me feel glad to be alive...

256
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,526
it's such an interesting world."

00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,912

[Joyce yelling] Will!

259
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,632
[Hopper] Will!

[Steve muttering]

261
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,919
This is crazy. This is crazy.
This is crazy.

262
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,255
This is crazy! This is crazy!
This is crazy!

263
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,385
What are you do--
What are you doing? Are you insane?

264
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,636
It's going to come back!

265
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,471
So you need to leave.

266
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,432
Right now.

267
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,240

[Nancy] Where is it?

270
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,668
[Jonathan] Come on.
Come on, you son of a bitch.

271
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,670
-You see it?
-No. Where--

272
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,838
Come on.

273
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,549
Where are you?
Come on!

[screeching continues faintly]

291
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,371
Get back! [grunting]

[all panting]

294
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,892
[Nancy] Where did it go?
[Jonathan] No.

295
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,394
It has to be dead.

296
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,646
[panting] It has to be.

297
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,324
[Hopper] Come on.

298
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,284
[Joyce] Is that my house?

299
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,376
[door creaking]

[Jonathan sighs]

302
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,234
[Hopper] It was hurt.

303
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,778
[Steve panting]

304
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,645
Mom.

305
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,647
[Jonathan echoing] <i>Is that you?</i>

306
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,192
<i>Mom.</i>

307
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,362
Jonathan?

308
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,951
[Hopper] Joyce, come on.

309
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,502
[crackling]

310
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,131
Where's it going?

311
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,551
I don't think that's the monster.

312
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,225
Found it!
I knew she was hoarding it.

313
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,643
-I knew it.
-Yeah.

314
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,186
Always lying, saying she's out.

315
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,855
Bald-faced liar.

316
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:03,233
Mike, I found the chocolate pudding!

317
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,693
Okay!

318
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,987
Are you feeling any better?

319
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,157
[sighs]

320
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,409
What's "putting"?

321
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,119
[chuckles] Pudding, it's...

322
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,745
it's this chocolate goo
you eat with a spoon.

323
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,289
Don't worry,

324
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,583
when all this is over,
you won't have to keep eating junk food

325
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,293
and leftovers like a dog anymore.

326
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,545
My mom,
she's a pretty awesome cook.

327
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,130
She can make you whatever you like.

328
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,506
Eggos?

329
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,843
Well, yeah, Eggos, but real food, too.

330
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,179
[sighs]

331
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,680
See, I was thinking,

332
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:37,017
once all this is over and Will's back
and you're not a secret anymore,

333
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,603
my parents can get you
an actual bed for the basement.

334
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,396
Or you can take my room if you want,

335
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:44,024
since I'm down there
all the time anyways.

336
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,234
My point is, they'll take care of you.

337
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,028
They'll be like your new parents,

338
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,864
and Nancy,
she'll be like your new sister.

339
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,742
Will you be like my brother?

340
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,536
What? No, no. [scoffs]

341
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,163
Why "no"?

342
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,623
Because... [sighs]

343
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,750
'cause it's different.

344
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,084
Why?

345
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,213
[sighs] I mean, I don't know,
I guess it's not.

346
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,590
It's stupid.

347
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,884
Mike?

348
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,135
Yeah?

349
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,346
Friends don't lie.

350
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,640
[sighing] Well...

351
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,017
I was thinking...

352
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,311
I don't know...

353
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,148
maybe we can go
to the Snow Ball together.

354
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,192
-"Snow Ball"?
-It's this cheesy school dance,

355
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,986
where you go in the gym
and dance to music and stuff.

356
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,781
I've never been, but I know you're not
supposed to go with your sister.

357
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,575
-No?
-I mean...

358
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,786
you can, but it'd be really weird.

359
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,539
You go to school dances

[Joyce echoing]
<i>Come back to me, breathe.</i>

539
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,267
I need you to wake up now.

540
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,685
I need you to breathe.

541
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,312
Please breathe!

542
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,148
Please!

543
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,150
[Will gasps and coughs]

544
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,318
[Joyce] That's it.

545
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,529
-Oh, my God, that's it, that's it.
-[coughing]

546
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,116
That's it, baby. Breathe.

547
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,327
Breathe. All right. Come on.

548
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,786
Come on.

549
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,955
Breathe, breathe, come on, come on.

550
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,749
Good, good, good, good.

551
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,918
Just breathe, Will, breathe.
[sobbing]

552
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:30,868
Michael?

553
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,121
Michael!

554
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,126
Michael?

555
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,341
[sobs] Oh, my God.

556
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,884
Oh, my God.

557
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,011
You're okay.

558
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,722
You're okay.

559
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,790
[EKG monitor beeping]

560
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,761
Hey.

561
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,638
-Hi, sweetheart.
-[Jonathan] Hey.

562
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,601
Where... where am I?

563
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:38,894
[Joyce sighs]

564
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,606
[Jonathan] You're home.
You're home now.

565
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,483
You're safe.

566
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,193
Jonathan.

567
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,905
Yeah, it's me, buddy.

568
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,784
[sighs] We missed you.

569
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,704
We really missed you.

570
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,248
Are you okay?

571
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,625
What, this?

572
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,837
It's just a cut.
It's nothing.

573
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,757
You're worried about my hand.

574
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,051
[both chuckle softly]

575
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,430
[Jonathan] Oh, hey, uh...

576
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,140
We, uh...

577
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:18,434
We brought you some stuff...

578
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,103
so you don't get bored in here.

579
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,938
So... [sniffles]

580
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,985
Uh, I made you a new mix tape.

581
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:31,489
There's some stuff on there
I think you really might like.

582
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,561
[snoring]

583
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,246
Guys. Guys, he's up.
Will is up. Guys, Will's up.

584
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,705
[Lucas and Dustin grunt]

585
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,040
[Mike] Guys, come on.

586
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,711
-[Mike] Byers!
-[Dustin laughs]

587
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,588
[Joyce] Be careful.
Be careful with him.

588
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,257
[Dustin] Move.
[Jonathan] Guys, guys.

589
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,092
-[Mike laughs]
-[Jonathan] Go easy on him.

590
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,678
You won't believe what happened
when you were gone, man.

591
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,388
-It was mental.
-[Lucas] You had a funeral.

592
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,306
-Jennifer Hayes was crying.
-And Troy peed himself.

593
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,058
-What?
-In front of the whole school!

594
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,184
-[Lucas] Yes!
-[coughing]

595
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,649
You okay?

596
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:50,734
It got me.

597
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,903
The Demogorgon.

598
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,446
We know.

599
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,531
It's okay.

600
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:56,991
It's dead.

601
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,200
We made a new friend.

602
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:01,245
She stopped it.
She saved us.

603
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,205
But she's gone now.

604
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,875
-Her name's Eleven.
-Like the number?

605
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,210
Well, we call her "El" for short.

606
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,378
She's basically a wizard.

607
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:10,629
[whispers] She has superpowers.

608
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:11,714
More like a Yoda.

609
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,340
[Dustin] She flipped a van with her mind,

610
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,592
and these agents
were trying to shoot us--

611
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,677
-Yeah, it flipped over us--
-Then she squeezed the brains out...

612
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,804
[Dustin] And blood was pouring out
of their faces.

613
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,222
[Mike] It was pouring out of their eyes.

614
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,724
[Lucas] Agents just started
grabbing us and stuff...

615
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,767
-[Dustin] ...shot out of the wall...
-[continues indistinctly]

616
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,106
[Mike] Something is coming.
Something angry.

617
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,440
Hungry for your blood.

618
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,359
It is almost here.

619
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,528
-What is it?
-It's the thessalhydra, I'm telling you.

620
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:58,695
It's not the thessalhydra.

621
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,322
I'm telling you, it's the thessalhydra.

622
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,865
-[loud thud]
-The thessalhydra!

623
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,534
-Damn it.
-[Mike] It roars in anger!

624
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,327
-Will, your action!
-What should I do? I--

625
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,121
Fireball him!

626
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,291
Fireball the son of a bitch.

627
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:17,005
-Fourteen!
-[all exclaim]

628
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,925
Direct hit. Will the Wise's fireball
hits the thessalhydra.

629
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,010
It makes a painful...
[imitates screeching]

630
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:25,055
and then... it crumbles to the ground.

631
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,517
Its clawed hand reaches for you
one last time

632
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,185
and, and, and...

633
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,687
and...

634
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,397
[all cheering]

635
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,195
Lucas cuts off its seven heads,

636
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,281
and Dustin places them
into his bag of holding.

637
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,575
You carry the heads out of the dungeon,
victorious,

638
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,243
and you present them to King Tristan.

639
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,703
He thanks you
for your bravery and service.

640
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:50,747
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's not it, is it?

641
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,124
No, there's a medal ceremony--

642
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,376
Oh, a medal ceremony?
What are you talking about?

643
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,420
-And--
-The campaign was way too short.

644
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,046
-Yeah!
-It was ten hours!

645
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,131
But it doesn't make any sense.

646
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:01,675
-It makes sense.
-Uh, no, what about the lost knight?

647
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,218
And the proud princess?

648
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,636
And those weird flowers in the cave?

649
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,721
-I don't know, it's--
-[door opens]

650
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:06,972
[footsteps approaching]

651
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,140
Jeez, what's that smell?

652
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:09,892
Have you guys been playing games all day,
or just farting?

653
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,435
[chuckles] Oh, that's just Dustin.

654
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:12,686
He farted.

655
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:14,104
-Dustin farted. [blows raspberry]
-[Dustin] Okay.

656
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:15,439
-[Lucas] Dustin farted.
-Very mature, Lucas.

657
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:16,565
-[Lucas blowing raspberry]
-[Dustin] Oh.

658
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,108
-Will.
-[Dustin] Shut up.

659
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,234
[Jonathan] Come on.
[Lucas] Dustin farted!

660
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,320
[Will] Bye, guys.
[Mike and Dustin] Bye, Will.

661
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,947
[Mike] See you, Will.

662
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,366
-[chuckles] Stop.
-No, you stop.

663
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,702
-[Dustin] No, you stop.
-[both grunting]

664
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,664
[Dustin] Yeah, scream!
You're like a little girl.

665
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,958
[boys laughing]

666
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,636
-So, you have fun?
-Yeah.

667
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:46,762
[Karen] Hey, boys.

668
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:47,846
-Hey, Mrs. Wheeler.
-Hi.

669
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,932
Hey, wish your mom
a merry Christmas for me, okay?

670
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,850
-Yeah.
-Yeah, thank you. Uh, merry Christmas.

671
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,268
Merry Christmas.

672
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,938
-So, uh, you win?
-Yeah.

673
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,690
-Awesome.
-Hey, Jonathan, wait up.

674
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,905
-Uh...
-Merry Christmas.

675
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,657
Thanks, um...

676
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,159
I... I didn't get you anything.

677
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,161
-I... I feel bad.
-No.

678
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:15,165
No, it's, uh, it's not really a present.

679
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,378
It's, um... Well, you'll see.

680
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,054
Merry Christmas.

681
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,974
-You ready? Let's go.
-[Will] Yeah.

682
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,313
[sighs] All right. Buckle up.

683
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:44,653
Can I open it?

684
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,197
Yeah, sure.

685
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,285
Whoa.

686
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,369
Pretty cool.

687
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,580
[chuckles]

688
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:55,747
Yeah.

689
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:59,042
Yeah, pretty cool. [chuckles softly]

690
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:03,589
[snoring]

691
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,267
Did you give it to him?

692
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,394
Yeah.

693
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,403
[indistinct chatter]

694
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,967
You leaving already, Chief?

695
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:52,346
Oh, come on, you think I actually wanted
to come to this thing? I was just hungry.

696
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,764
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.

697
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:56,850
Well, your wife doesn't have time
to cook for me, you know what I'm saying?

698
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:58,185
[Powell chuckling]

699
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,687
Merry Christmas, Hop.

700
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,315
-Mmm.
-[chuckles]

701
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,174
[dog barking]

702
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,802
-[Jonathan] What you got there?
-[Christmas music playing]

703
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:14,928
That one of yours?

704
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,013
-Yeah.
-[Jonathan] Looks pretty big.

705
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,685
Be careful.
You'll break it.

706
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,900
What are you...
What are you doing?

707
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,402
[Jonathan] Documenting.

708
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,862
Oh, why?

709
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,321
-Because...
-[Joyce chuckles]

710
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,575
-It looks great.
-Oh, this is just so overcooked.

711
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:39,202
-And look, the potatoes are runny.
-Mom.

712
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,622
-They're so runny.
-[chuckles] Mom, it's gonna be great.

713
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,208
-It's definitely an Atari.
-An a-what-i?

714
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,585
The green present.
It's an Atari.

715
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:49,296
I felt Dustin's today,
it's the same exact weight.

716
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,257
-Really? Well...
-[Will] Yeah.

717
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,009
We'll have to see, won't we?

718
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,637
Hey, no more snooping.

719
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,890
No, I forgot to wash my hands.
I'll be right back.

720
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,183
Okay.

721
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,311
-[softly] He's washing his hands?
-[chuckles]

722
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,402
[coughs]

723
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,030
[retches]

724
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,292
[groans]

725
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,353
-[Jonathan] Thanks.
-[both laughing]

726
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:50,732
Are you okay?

727
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,652
Yeah, I'm okay.

728
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,445
[Jonathan] Mmm. Very good, Mom.

729
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,658
Mmm. Hey, Mom.
Did Will tell you about, uh, the game?

730
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:00,909
-Oh, yeah.
-No. What game?

731
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:03,286
I threw a fireball at him and...
[imitates explosion] dead.

732
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,664
Wait, what is...
You mean, this is...

733
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,249
No, it's just Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

734
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,084
-Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Right.
-It's fun.

735

[Mike] Something is coming.
Something hungry for blood.

10
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:52,821
A shadow grows on the wall behind you,
swallowing you in darkness.

11
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,864
-It is almost here.
-What is it?

12
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,282
What if it's the Demogorgon?

13
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,410
Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed
if it's the Demogorgon.

14

It's not the Demogorgon.

15
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,872
An army of troglodytes
charge into the chamber!

No, that...

24
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,392
That came from something else.

-Fireball him!

28
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,151
I'd have to roll a 13 or higher!

29
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,069
Too risky.
Cast a protection spell.

30
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,697
-Don't be a pussy. Fireball him!
-Cast Protection.

31
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,491
The Demogorgon is tired
of your silly human bickering!

32
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,368
It stomps towards you.

00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,452
-Boom!
-Fireball him!

34
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,830

[Dustin] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

[Karen] Mike!
[Lucas] Can you find it yet?

43
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,720
[Will] No, I can't find it!

44

-Mike!
-[Dustin] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

45

Mom, we're in the middle of a campaign!

46
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,559
You mean the end?
Fifteen after.

47
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,812
[Lucas] Oh, my God! Freaking idiot!
[Will] Why do we have to go?

48
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,607
-Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes!
-It's a school night, Michael.

49
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,151
I just put Holly to bed.
You can finish next weekend.

50
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,777
-But that'll ruin the flow!
-Michael--

51
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,112
I'm serious, Mom.

52
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,656
The campaign took two weeks to plan.

53
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,658
How was I supposed to know
it was gonna take ten hours?

54
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,619
You've been playing for ten hours?

55
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:27,749

-I think you should listen to your mother.

-[static crackling on TV]
-[grunts] Dang dumb piece of junk.

[Will] Oh, I got it!

58
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,257
-Does the seven count?
-It was a seven?

59
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,469
Did Mike see it?
Then it doesn't count.

60
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,266
[Dustin] Yo, hey, guys.

61
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,227
-Does anyone want this?
-[both] No.

62
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,856
[Nancy] Yeah.

63
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,234
No, I don't think...

64
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,945
Yeah, he's cute.

65
00:03:57,028 --> 00:04:00,365
Barb, no, I don't think so.

66
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,908
-Barb, you're not--
-Hey, Nancy.

67
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,160
There's a slice left if you want it.

68
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,579
-Sausage and pepperoni!
-Hold on.

69
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:17,382
-There's something wrong with your sister.
-What are you talking about?

70
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:19,259
-She's got a stick up her butt.
-[Lucas] Yeah.

71
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:21,844
It's because she's been dating
that douchebag, Steve Harrington.

72
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,680
[Dustin] Yeah,
she's turning into a real jerk.

73
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,098
She's always been a real jerk.

74
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,058
Nuh-uh, she used to be cool.

75
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,519
Like that time she dressed up as an elf
for our Elder tree campaign.

76
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,812
[Mike] Four years ago!

77
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,355
[Dustin] Just saying.
[Lucas] Later.

78
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,984
-It was a seven.
-Huh?

79
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,819
The roll, it was a seven.

80
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,114
The Demogorgon, it got me.

81
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,158
[grunts] See you tomorrow.

82
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,844
[Lucas] Good night, ladies.
[Dustin] Kiss your mom 'night for me.

83
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,264
Race you back to my place?
Winner gets a comic.

84

-Yeah.

00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,617
Will?
No, no, no, it's just Mike.

174
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,119
Will didn't spend the night?

175
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,621
[Karen] <i>No, he left here</i>
<i>a little bit after 8:00.</i>

176
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,039
Why? He's not home?

177
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,960
Um, you know what? I think
he just left early for... for school.

178
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,045
-Thank you so much. Bye.
<i>-Okay. Bye.</i>

179
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,398
[school bell ringing]

180
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,904
That's weird.
I don't see him.

181
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,530
[Lucas] I'm telling you, his mom's right.

182
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,449
He probably just
went to class early again.

183
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,035
Yeah, he's always paranoid
Gursky's gonna give him another pop quiz.

184
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,037
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.

185
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,373
Step right up and get your tickets
for the freak show.

186
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,084
Who do you think would make more money
in a freak show?

187
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:19,757
Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless?

188
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,009
[sighs]

189
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,346
[mimicking Dustin]
I'd go with Toothless.

190
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,891
I told you a million times,
my teeth are coming in.

191
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,726
It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.

192
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,811
[mimicking Dustin]
"I told you a million times."

193
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,939
-[chuckles]
-Do the arm thing.

194
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,066
Do it, freak!

195
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,322
-[bones cracking]
-[both groaning]

196
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,658
[Troy] God, it gets me every time.

197
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,828
-Assholes.
-[Mike] I think it's kinda cool.

198
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,081
It's like you have superpowers
or something.

199
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,041
Like Mr. Fantastic.

200
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,377
[Dustin] Yeah,
except I can't fight evil with it.

201
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,467
[bell ringing]

202
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,512
[Barbara] So, did he call?

203
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,139
Keep your voice down.

204
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,808
Did he?

205
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,643
I told you, it's not like that.

206
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,981
Okay, I mean, yes, he likes me,
but not like that.

207
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,983
We just...

208
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,610
made out a couple times.

209
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,072
"We just... made out a couple times."

210
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,490
Nance, seriously,

211
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,659
you're gonna be so cool now,
it's ridiculous.

212
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,160
No, I'm not.

213
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,914
You better still hang out with me,
that's all I'm saying.

214
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,792
If you become friends with Tommy H.
or Carol--

215
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,168
Oh, that's gross!

216
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,421
Okay,
I'm telling you, it was a one-time...

217
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,340
-Two-time thing.
-[chuckles]

218
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,471
You were saying?

219
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,358
-Steve...
-Mmm-hmm?

220
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,110
-I have to go.
-In a minute.

221
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,486
[bell ringing]

222
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,864
Steve.
I really, like...

223
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,782
Seriously, I have to go.

224
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,242
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's...

225
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,202
Come on, let's do something tonight, yeah?

226
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,205
Uh... No, I can't.
I have to study for Kaminsky's test.

227
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,541
Oh, come on.
What's your GPA again? 3.999...

228
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,335
Kaminsky's tests are impossible.

229
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,587
-Well, then, just let me help.
-You failed chem.

230
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,672
-C-minus.
-Well, in that case...

231
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,091
So I'll be over around, say, like, 8:00?

232
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,136
-Are you crazy? My mom would not--
-I'll climb through your window.

233
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,388
She won't even know I'm there.
I'm stealthy, like a ninja.

234
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,723
You are crazy.

235
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,642
Wait, wait, wait. Just...
Okay, forget about that.

236
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,018
We can just...

237
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,020
We can just, like, chill in my car.

238
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,065
We can find
a nice quiet place to park, and...

239
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,568
Steve... I have to study.

240
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,362
I'm not kidding.

241
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,739
Well, why do you think
I want it to be nice and quiet?

242
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,493
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

243
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,119
[sighs]

244
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,043
Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00.

245
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,253
To study.

246
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,425
[bell ringing]

247
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,768
Good of you to show.

248
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:21,522
[Hopper slurring] Oh, hey, morning, Flo.
Morning, everybody.

249
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:25,275
-Hey, Chief.
-Damn! You look like hell, Chief.

250
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,360
-Oh, yeah?
-[chuckles] Yeah.

251
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,988
Well, I looked better than your wife
when I left her this morning.

252
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,072
[officers laughing]

253
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,699
While you were drinking or sleeping,

254
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,743
or whatever it is you deemed
so necessary on Monday morning,

255
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,828
Phil Larson called.

256
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,580
Said some kids are stealing
the gnomes out of his garden again.

257
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,124
Oh, those garden gnomes again.

258
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,459
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna get right on that.

259
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,086
On a more pressing matter,

260
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,213
Joyce Byers can't find her son
this morning.

261
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:49,049
[muffled] Mmm.
Okay, I'm gonna get on that.

262
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,343
-Just give me a minute.
-Joyce is very upset.

263
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,303
Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this.

264
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,723
Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.

265
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:59,685
-Chief, she's already in your--
-Coffee and contemplation, Flo!

266
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,948
I have been waiting here
over an hour, Hopper.

267
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:15,617
[sighs deeply] And I apologize again.

268
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,077
I'm going out of my mind!

269
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,748
Look, boy his age,
he's probably just playing hookie, okay?

270
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,833
No, not my Will.
He's not like that.

271
00:17:22,915 --> 00:17:24,460
-He wouldn't do that.
-Well, you never know.

272
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,252
I mean, my mom thought
I was on the debate team,

273
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,921
when really I was just screwing
Chrissy Carpenter

274
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,673
in the back of my dad's Oldsmobile, so...

275
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,718
Look, he's not like you, Hopper.
He's not like me.

276
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,304
He's not like... most.

277
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:39,266
He has a couple of friends,
but, you know, the kids, they're mean.

278
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,185
They make fun of him.
They call him names.

279
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,312
-They laugh at him, his clothes--
-His clothes?

280
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,355
-What's wrong with his clothes?
-I don't know.

281
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,733
-Does that matter?
-Maybe.

282
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,861
Look, he's...
He's a sensitive kid.

283
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:54,656
Lonnie... [sighs]
Lonnie used to say he was queer.

284
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,075
[softy] Called him a fag.

285
00:17:56,158 --> 00:18:00,079
-Is he?
-He's missing is what he is.

286
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,957
When was the last time
you heard from Lonnie?

287
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,084
[scoffs]

288
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:10,422
Uh, last I heard, he was in Indianapolis.
That was about a year ago.

289
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,258
-But he has nothing to do with this.
-Why don't you give me his number?

290
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,219
You know, Hopper,
he has nothing to do with this. Trust me.

291
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,514
Joyce, 99 out of 100 times,
kid goes missing,

292
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,724
the kid is with a parent or relative.

293
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,309
[stammers] What about the other time?

294
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:25,729
-What?
-You said, "99 out of 100."

295
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,856
-What about the other time, the one?
-Joyce.

296
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,066
The one!

297
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,984
-Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay?
-[sighs]

298
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,820
You wanna know the worst thing
that's ever happened here

299
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,987
in the four years I've been working here?

300
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,239
Do you wanna know the worst thing?

301
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,450
It was when an owl attacked
Eleanor Gillespie's head

302
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,244
because it thought
that her hair was a nest.

303
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,996
Okay, fine.
I will call Lonnie.

304
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,790
He will talk to me before he talks to--

305
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,834
-What, a pig?
-A cop!

306
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,921
[voice breaking] Just find my son, Hop.

307
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,881
Find him!

308
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,644
[man] Dr. Brenner.

309
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,273
[scientist] This way, gentlemen.

310
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,192
The entire east wing
will be evacuated within the hour.

311
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:16,113
We've sealed off this area
following quarantine protocol.

312
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,955
[air hissing]

313
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,176
[guns cocking]

314
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,929
[elevator humming]

315
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,064
[elevator thuds]

316
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,984
[squelching]

317
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,660
[low growling]

318
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,548
[indistinct growling]

319
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,930
[man 1] This is where it came from?
[man 2] Yes.

320
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,014
[man 1] And the girl?

321
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,768
She can't have gone far.

322
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,605
[growls]

323
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,432
[music playing faintly]

324
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,740
[Ben] All right, and one more.

325
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,617
[man] Hey, Ben.
What do you think about that, uh...

326
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,244
Hey, I don't know.
I don't know.

327
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,663
[man] I don't know,
37 points per game average--

328
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,457
[Ben] Thirty-seven now, but...
[man] Mr. Basket.

329
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,063
[indistinct chatter]

330
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,113
Hey!

331
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,323
Come here!

332
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,366
Hey, come here!

333
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,082
You think you can steal from me, boy?

334
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,752
What in the hell?

335
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,131
-[bell ringing]
-[Mr. Clarke] Remember, finish chapter 12

336
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:07,010
and answer 12.3 on the difference
between an experiment

337
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,221
and other forms of science investigation.

338
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:13,183
This will be on the test,
which will cover chapters 10 through 12.

339
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:16,311
[trailing off] It will be multiple choice
with an essay section.

340
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,356
So, did it come?

341
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,816
Sorry, boys.

342
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,776
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but...

343
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:24,903
it came.

344
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,491
Yes!

345
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,368
The Heathkit ham shack.

346
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,911
[Mike] Whoa.
[Mr. Clarke] Ain't she a beaut?

347
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,038
I bet you can talk to New York
on this thing.

348
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,289
Think bigger.

349
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,375
-California?
-Bigger.

350
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,835

-[Lucas] Oh, man!

352
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:45,340

Hello, this is Mike Wheeler,

357
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,725
president of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

358
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,478
[Lucas] What are you doing?

359
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,729
[in Australian accent]
Hello, this is Dustin,

360
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,816
and this is the secretary and treasurer
of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

361
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,068
Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast?

Michael, Lucas and Dustin?

[overlapping chatter]

365
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,623
Okay, okay, okay.

366
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,668
One at a time, all right?
You.

367
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,379
-You said he takes what?
-Mirkwood.

368
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,048
-Mirkwood?
-Yeah.

369
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,635
-Have you ever heard of Mirkwood?
-I have not. That sounds made up to me.

370
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,512
No, it's from <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

371
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,473
-Well, <i>The Hobbit.</i>
-It doesn't matter.

372
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,392
-He asked!
-[mockingly] "He asked!"

373
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,060
-[Mike] Shut up, guys!
-Hey, hey, hey!

374
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,104
-What'd I just say?
-Shut up.

375
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,482
One at a damn time.
You.

376
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,777
Mirkwood, it's a real road.
It's just the name that's made up.

377
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,237
It's where Cornwallis and Kerley meet.

378
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,823
-Yeah, all right, I think I know that--
-We can show you, if you want.

379
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,241
I said that I know it!

380
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,243
-We can help look.
-Yeah.

381
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,245
-No.
-[boys clamoring]

382
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,457
No.
After school, you are all to go home.

383
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,750
Immediately.

384
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:05,629
That means no biking around looking
for your friend, no investigating,

385
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:06,796
no nonsense.

386
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,840
This isn't some <i>Lord of the Rings</i> book.

387
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,718
<i>-The Hobbit.</i>
-Shut up!

388
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,178
-Hey!
-[Mike] Stop it!

389
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,387
[boys bickering]

390
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,389
[softly] Do I make myself clear?

391
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:26,149
Do I make myself... clear?

392
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,944
[Mike and Dustin] Yes, sir.
[Lucas] Yeah.

393
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,499
Ring-a-ding-ding!

394
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,292
Anybody home?

395
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,002
[Will] Password?

396
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,046
Uh, Rada...

397
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,883
[stammering] Radaga-- Radagast?

398
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,386
[Will] Yeah. You may enter.

399
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,930
[Joyce] Thank you, sir.

400
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,557
So, guess what?

401
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,102
I got off early and...

402
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,854
Ta-da!
<i>Poltergeist.</i>

403
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,481
I... I thought I wasn't allowed to see it.

404
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:07,941
I changed my mind.

405
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,819
As long as you don't have nightmares
for a week.

406
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,405
No, I won't.
I don't get scared like that anymore.

407
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,489
Oh, yeah?

408
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,241
Not even of clowns?

409
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,409
No.

410
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,869
What about my witch?

411
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,371
-No. Mom...
-Ooh...

412
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,290
-I'm not five anymore.
-But Will Byers...

413
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,834
-I'm going to cook you up in my--
-Stop. That's so stupid. Mom!

-[Jonathan] Will!
-Will?

420

[Joyce] Will!

421
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,479
Where are you?

422
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,073
Geez.

423
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,701
Your parents forget to feed you?

424
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,206
Is that why you ran away?

425
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:09,878
They, uh...

426
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,047
They hurt you?

427
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,634
You went to the hospital, you got scared,

428
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,386
you ran off, you wound up here,
is that it?

429
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,640
All right.

430
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,854
I'll give this back, all right?
And you can have as much as you want.

431
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,939
All right?
Maybe even some ice cream.

432
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,108
But you gotta answer
a few of my questions first, all right?

433
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,445
We got a deal?

434
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:41,076
All right, let's start
with the easy stuff. All right?

435
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,537
My name's Benny.
Benny Hammond.

436
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,331
See? Like this. Here.

437
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,334
I got you.
Don't worry. It's okay.

438
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,879
Nice to meet you, yeah.
And you are?

What's that mean?

443
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,228
What's it mean?

444
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,564
-No.
-Well, I'll be damned.

445
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,358
She speaks.

446
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,110
"No"? No, what?

447
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,906
[clicks tongue] All right.
I guess no more food, then.

00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,576

456
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,178
Yeah, look, all I know
is that she's scared to death.

457
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,389
Yeah, I think
maybe she's been abused or...

458
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,099
kidnapped or something.

459
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,186
Yeah, it'd be great
if someone would come by.

460

-Yeah, he must have crashed.

472
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,210
[Callahan] You think
he got hurt in the fall?

473
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,629
Not so hurt he couldn't walk away.

00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,830
-Well, he had a key to the house, right?
-[Jonathan] Yeah.

514
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,249
So...

515
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,376
maybe he came home.

516
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,503
[stammers] You think I didn't check
my own house?

517
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,380
I'm not saying that.

518
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,051
-Has this always been here?
-[Joyce] What? I don't know.

519
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,970
Probably. I mean, I have two boys.
Look at this place.

520
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,765
You're not sure?

521

[barks]

523
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,736
Hey.

524
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,114
Hey, what's up with this guy, huh?

525
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,700
Nothing, he's probably just hungry.
Come on.

526
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,012
[indistinct squelching]

527

-[Callahan] Hey!
-Jesus!

529
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,992
What are you, deaf?
I've been calling you.

530
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,536
-[exhales]
-What's going on?

531
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,831
Hello?

532
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:05,001
-Are you sure you're okay, Chief?
-Listen, I want you to call Flo.

533
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,419
I want to get
a search party together, all right?

534
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:09,630
All the volunteers she can muster.
Bring flashlights, too.

535
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,007
[Callahan] Hey, you think
we got a problem here?

536
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:21,809
[Mike] We should be out there right now.
We should be helping look for him.

537
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,770
We've been over this, Mike.
The chief says--

538
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,353
-I don't care what the chief said.
-Michael!

539
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,106
We have to do something.
Will can be in danger.

540
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,399
More reason to stay put.

541
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,525
-Mom!
-End of discussion.

542
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,659
So... me and Barbara are gonna
study at her house tonight.

543
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,161
-That's cool, right?
-No, not cool.

544
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,496
What? Why not?

545
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,792
Why do you think?
Am I speaking Chinese in this house?

546
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,920
Until we know Will is okay, no one leaves.

547
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,797
-This is such bullshit.
-Language.

548
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,297
So we're under house arrest?

549
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,300
Just because Mike's friend got lost
on the way home from...

550
00:34:54,382 --> 00:34:56,677
-Wait, this is Will's fault?
-Nancy, take that back.

551
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,304
-No!
-You're just pissed off

552
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,348
'cause you wanna hang out with Steve.

553
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,226
-Steve?
-Who is Steve?

554
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,728
-Her new boyfriend.
-You are such a douchebag, Mike!

555
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,605
-Language!
-[groans]

556
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,691
Nancy, come back.

557
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,777
Come back!

558
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,280
[sighs] It's okay. It's okay, Holly.
Here, have some juice, okay?

559
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,032
You see, Michael?

560
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,409
-You see what happens?
-[shouting] What happens when what?

561
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:24,080
I'm the only one acting normal here!
I'm the only one that cares about Will!

562
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,207
That is really unfair, son.

563
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,500
We care.

564
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,296
[sighs]

565
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,173
-Mike!
-Let him go.

566
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:39,303
I hope you're enjoying your chicken, Ted.

567
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,597
What did I do?

568
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,519
Hey! What'd I do?

569
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,607
[boy] Will!
[man 1] Will Byers!

570
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:52,733
[man 2] Will!

571
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,652
[woman] Will, we're here for you, bud!

572
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,529
[volunteers shouting indistinctly]

573
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,740
[Mr. Clarke] He's a good student.

574
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:03,244
-[Hopper] What?
-Will. He's a good student.

575
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,954
Great one, actually.

576
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,373
I don't think we've met.
Scott Clarke.

577
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:10,751
Teacher, Hawkins Middle.
Earth and biology.

578
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,837
[Hopper] I always had
a distaste for science.

579
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,881
[Mr. Clarke] Well, maybe you had
a bad teacher.

580
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,300
[Hopper] Yeah, Ms. Ratliff
was a piece of work.

581
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:20,011
[Mr. Clarke chuckles] Ratliff?
You bet.

582
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,263
She's still kicking around,
believe it or not.

583
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:26,142
[Hopper] Oh, I believe it.
Mummies never die, so they tell me.

584
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,269
Sarah, my daughter...

585
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:33,816
Galaxies, the universe, whatnot...
She always understood all that stuff.

586
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,360
I always figured there was enough
going on down here,

587
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,196
I never needed to look elsewhere.

588
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,489
[Mr. Clarke] Your daughter,
what grade is she?

589
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,367
-Maybe I'll get her in my class.
-No, she, uh...

590
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,995
She lives with her mom in the city.

591
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:49,540
Thanks for coming out, Teach.
We really appreciate it.

592
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,629
-She died a few years back.
-Sorry?

593
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:55,963
His kid.

594
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,977
Lucas, do you copy?
It's Mike.

595
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,897
<i>-Lucas?</i>
-Hey, it's Lucas.

596
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,981
I know it's you.

597
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,235
And say "over" when you're done talking
so I know when you're done. Over.

598
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,945
I'm done. Over.

599
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,447
I'm worried about Will. Over.

600
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,574
[sighs] Yeah.

601
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,328
This is crazy. Over.

602
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,038
I was thinking...

603
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,376
Will could've cast Protection last night,
but he didn't.

604
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,460
He cast Fireball.

605
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:38,297
<i>-Over.</i>
-What's your point? Over.

606
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:43,094
My point is... he could've played it safe,
but he didn't.

607
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,054
He put himself in danger
to help the party.

608
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,264
<i>Over.</i>

609
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,477
Meet me in ten.
Over and out.

[whispers] What are you doing here?

613
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,678
I told you on the phone,
I'm under house arrest now.

614
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,597
-I figured we'd just study here.
-No. No way.

615
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,933
Oh, come on.
I can't have you failing this test.

616
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,810
So just... bear with me.

All right.
You just sit tight.

628

Whoever it is, I'll tell 'em to go away
real quick, all right?

629

-Yeah, yeah, yeah...

630
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,735
-Hey, can I help you?
-Hi, you must be Benny Hammond.

631
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:25,071
I'm afraid I am. I'm afraid
we're closed for the evening, too.

Ah, Social Services. My apologies.
I didn't expect you so soon.

-That's a heck of a drive.
-Not too bad this time of night.

635
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,123
Hey, listen, I...
I haven't told her that you're coming yet.

636
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:40,169
I didn't want her running off again.
She's a tad skittish.

-Children I work with usually are.
-Right, right.

638

-So, where is she?
-Right. She's in the kitchen.

to turn you away there.

00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,160
[whispers] Steve.
Steve, come on.

683
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,245
What?

684
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,455
Are you crazy?
My parents are here.

685
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,668
That's weird, I... don't see them.

686
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:34,176
Was this your plan all along?
To... to get in my room and then...

687
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,845
-get another notch on your belt.
-No. Nancy, no.

688
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,056
I'm not Laurie, or Amy, or Becky.

689
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,724
You mean, you're not a slut.

690
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,643
That's not what I'm saying.

691
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,478
You know, you're so cute when you lie.

692
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,230
Shut up.

693
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,484
Bad Steve.

694
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:54,113
[groans] Bad.
Don't do that to Miss Nancy...

695
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,740
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

696
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,702
You are beautiful, Nancy Wheeler.

697
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,041
[Steve grunts]

698
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,711
"Compared to the rate
of inorganic reactions,

699
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:12,548
the rate of organic reactions
is generally..."

-[thunder rumbling]
-[rain falling]

701
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,596
[Joyce] Jonathan, wow.
You took these?

702
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,015
These are great.

703
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:25,102
[sniffling] Wow, they really are.

704
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,356
I know I haven't been there for you.
[stammers] I've been...

705
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,525
working so hard and I...

706
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,444
I just feel bad.
I don't even...

707
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,988
barely know what's going on with you.
[chuckles]

708
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:38,824
All right?
I am sorry about that.

709
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,201
[Jonathan sobs softly]

710
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,495
Hey, what is it?

711
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,748
What is it, honey?

712
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,918
-Nothing. [sniffles]
-Tell me. Tell me.

713
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,046
-Come on. You can...
-No.

714
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,297
It's just...

715
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,300
[voice breaking]
I should've been there for him.

716
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:59,386
[hoarsely] No. Oh, no.
You can't do that to yourself.

717
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,681
This was not your fault.
Do you hear me?

718
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:06,435
He is... close.
I know it. [stammers] I...

719
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:09,813
I feel it in my heart.
[sniffles]

720
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:13,359
You just have to...
You have to trust me on this, okay?

721
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,693
[sniffles]

722
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,780
-Yeah.
-Oh, look at this.

723
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:20,240
Look at this one.
Look at this one.

724
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,659
[both laugh]

725
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,745
-I mean, that's it, right?
-Yeah.

726
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,622
[hoarsely] That's it.
That's the one.

Lonnie?

731
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,800
-Dad?
-Hopper?

732
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,927
-[muffled breathing on phone]
-Who is this?

733
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,845
[breathing continues]

734
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,264
Will?

735
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,225
-Will?
-It's Will?

736

-[scrambled voice chitters]

737

-Mom, it's Will?

738
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,856
-[yelling] Who is this?
-[indistinct growling]

739
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,067
-[yelling] What have you done to my boy?
-What? What?

740
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,652
Give me back my son!

-Hello?

743
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,782
Hello, who is this?

744
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,618
-Hello? Who is this?
-[sobbing]

745
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:07,162
-Mom, who was it? Who was it, Mom?
-[muttering incoherently]

746
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,914
-[sobbing] It was him.
-Look at me, Mom. Was it Will?

747
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,207
-Yes.
-What did he say?

748
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,418
[sobbing] He just breathed.
He just breathed.

749
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,461
-[Jonathan] And was someone else there?
-I...

750
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,256
-Mom, who was there? Who was it?
-It was him.

751
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:20,050
I know it was his breathing.
I know it was his breathing.

752
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,260

753
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:22,719
-[thunder rumbling]
-[Mike] Will!

754
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,223
-Will!
-[Lucas] Byers!

755
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:29,059
[Dustin] I've got your <i>X-Men 134!</i>

756
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,895
Guys, I really think
we should turn back.

757
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,230
[Lucas] Seriously, Dustin?

758
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,607
You wanna be a baby,
then go home already!

759
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,401
I'm just being realistic, Lucas!

760
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,486
No, you're just being a big sissy!

761
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,490
[Dustin] Did you ever think Will went
missing because he ran into something bad?

762
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,452
And we're going to the exact same spot
where he was last seen?

763
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:49,371
-And we have no weapons or anything?
-Dustin, shut up.

764
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,457
I'm just saying,
does that seem smart to you?

765
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,667
-Shut up. Shut up.
-[rustling]

766
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,419
Did you guys hear that?

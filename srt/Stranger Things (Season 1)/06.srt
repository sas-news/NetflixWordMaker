00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:09,718
[Jonathan] Nancy!

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,303
[panting] Nancy!

3
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:13,763
Come on, come on.

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,432
Nancy!

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,643
Where are you?

6
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,771
[Nancy echoing] Jonathan! Jonathan!

7
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,940
Jonathan!

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,360
Jonathan, I'm right here!

9
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,195
Nancy!

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,531
[breathing heavily]

11
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:32,741
Nancy!

12
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,410
[Nancy] Jonathan, where are you?

13
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,121
Jonathan! [breathing heavily]

14
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,914
Jonathan!

15
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,125
Jonathan, I'm right...
I'm right here!

16
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,002
-[faintly] Where are you?
-[panting]

17
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,712
-I'm right here!
-[Nancy] Jonathan!

18
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,173
I'm right here! Nancy!

19
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:52,469
-Just follow my voice!
-[panting] Jonathan!

20
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,805
[Jonathan in distance]
Follow my voice, Nancy, I'm right here!

21
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,182
Nancy!

22
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,684
-[growling]
-[gasps]

23
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,186
Nancy!

24
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,229
[panting]

25
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:07,275
-[growling continues]
-[breathing heavily]

26
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,156
[squelching]

27
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,578
[growling continues]

28
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,092
Nancy?

29
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:35,720
Nancy.

30
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,850
[Jonathan in distance] Nancy!
Follow my voice!

31
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,562
[monster growling]

32
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,774
Nancy?

33
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,531
[Jonathan gasps]

34
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,282
-[Nancy] Jonathan!
-Nancy!

35
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,452
-[Nancy straining]
-[Jonathan grunting]

36
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:11,339
[Nancy sobbing]

37
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,467
[Jonathan panting] I got you.

38
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,316
[theme music playing]

39
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,254
[pop song playing on car stereo]

40
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,760
I just don't understand
why we're coming out here.

41
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:42,096
-She obviously doesn't wanna talk to you.
-That's... that's not it.

42
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,850
Oh, really? Because no girl
would ever blow off King Steve.

43
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,603
She was acting weird.
I mean, something was wrong.

44
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,605
So what? [scoffs]
Like, you're worried about her?

45
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:54,108
-What?
-Aw, you are.

46
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,903
-Aw, Steve has a heart.
-Would you just-- Stop.

47
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,571
-Oh, Stevey's in love.
-Would you just shut up?

48
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,989
-Who knew?
-Shut up!

49
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,407
[chuckling] Jeez.

50
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,411
-[Carol] Damn. Sorry.
-[Tommy chuckles]

51
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,169
[sighs] So this is it, huh?
Princess' castle.

52
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,923
[Steve] I'll just be a minute.

53
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,372
[Joyce] Look, we gotta
go through this again.

54
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,250
-I told you everything that I saw.
-Oh, gosh. Tell me again.

55
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,627
-Upstairs or downstairs?
-Upstairs.

56
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,837
There was a laboratory.

57
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,506
It was where they must do experiments
or something, and then there was...

58
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,632
[inhales deeply]

59
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,134
There was this kid's room.

60
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:04,887
-How do you know it was a kid's room?
-More like a prison.

61
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,390
So why would you think
it was a kid's room, then?

62
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,850
Because, I told you,

63
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,644
the size of the bed, there was a drawing,
there was a stuffed animal--

64
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,354
[stammers] You didn't say
there was a drawing.

65
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,273
Yeah, there was a drawing of a...
an adult and a child.

66
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,692
-It said "Eleven" on it.
-Was it good?

67
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,028
It was a kid's drawing, Joyce.
It was stick figures.

68
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,404
[sighs]

69
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,785
Wasn't Will.

70
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,962
Earl...

71
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,840
The night that Benny died,

72
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:46,220
Earl said he saw some kid
with a shaved head with Benny.

73
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:50,058
Now, I pressed him,
he said it might be Will, but maybe...

74
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,934
Wait... Maybe, it wasn't?

75
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,354
Look... this woman, Terry Ives,

76
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,522
she claims to have lost
her daughter, Jane.

77
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,025
She sued Brenner,
she sued the government...

78
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,486
Now, the claims came to nothing,
but what if...

79
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,698
I mean,
what if this whole time I've been...

80
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,450
I've been looking for Will...

81
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,495
I've been chasing after some other kid?

82
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,044
-[Jonathan gasps]
-[monster growling]

83
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,302
-[growling]
-[gasps]

84
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,264
[Jonathan] Nancy!

85
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,729
[monster growls]

86
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,243
Better?

87
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,204
Yeah.

88
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,084
Is this okay?
Uh, I found it in the closet.

89
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,712
I can go home.
[stammers] I just figured--

90
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,756
Yeah, no.
I... [stammers]

91
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:08,136
-I don't wanna be alone.
-[sighs]

92
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:12,265
-Do you?
-No. Uh... no.

93
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,851
[sighs]

94
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,177
Can you just come up here?

95
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,766
Yeah.

96
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,697
-Do you want the lights off, or--
-[softly] On.

97
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,200
[softly] Yeah.

98
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,413
You know, it...

99
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,249
it can't get us in here.

100
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,173
We don't know that.

101
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,700
Uh, yeah, it's Ives.
Terry Ives. That's with a "Y."

102
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,703
Yeah, I got a pen.
Hang on.

103
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,665
Mmm-hmm.

104
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,334
Mmm-hmm.

105
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,546
Great, thanks.
I really appreciate this, Frank.

106
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,631
Say hi to the boys for me, too, would you?

107
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,682
Did you get it?

108
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,684
-I got it.
-Okay.

109
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,740
[grunting softly]

110
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,496
[pages rustling]

111
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,706
Oh...

112
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,791
Hey.

113
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,252
[Nancy] Hey.

114
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,464
[grunts] Couldn't sleep?

115
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,887
Every time I close my eyes, I just...

116
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,516
keep seeing that... thing.

117
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:47,063
Wherever I was, that place...

118
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,733
I think that it lives there.

119
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,652
It was feeding there.

120
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,780
Feeding on that deer.

121
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,241
That means that if...
[inhales deeply]

122
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,744
if Will and Barbara...

123
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,832
Hey.

124
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,585
My mom said she talked to Will.

125
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,005
If he's alive,
there's a chance Barbara is, too.

126
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,091
That means that she's trapped...

127
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,510
in that place.

128
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,265
We have to find it again.

129
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,309
You wanna go back out there?

130
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,186
Maybe we don't have to.

131
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,564
When I saw it,
it was feeding on that deer.

132
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,776
-Meaning it's... it's a predator, right?
-Right.

133
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,947
And it seems to hunt at night, like a...
a lion or a coyote.

134
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,740
But it doesn't hunt in packs like them.

135
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,993
It's always alone, like...

136
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,121
like a bear.

137
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,541
And remember at Steve's,
when Barb cut herself?

138
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:52,169
-And then, last night, the deer...
-Hmm, it was bleeding, too.

139
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,504
One sec.

140
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,966
Sharks can detect blood
in one part per million.

141
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,009
That's one drop of blood in a million,

142
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,345
and they can smell it
from a quarter mile away.

143
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,098
So you're saying it can detect blood?

144
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,184
[softly] It's just a theory.

145
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,187
We could test it.

146
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,400
But if it works...

147
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,278
At least we'll know it's coming.

148
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,489
-[door knob rattles]
-[both gasp]

149
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,075
-[Nancy sighs]
-[Karen] Honey, are you up?

150
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,661
Yeah, I'm... I'm getting dressed.

151
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,289
[Karen] I, uh, made
some blueberry pancakes.

152
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,040
I'll be down in a second.

153
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,626
-[footsteps receding]
-[sighing]

154
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,962
[Jonathan sighing]

155
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,554
-[sighs]
-Your mom doesn't knock?

156
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,139
[both chuckle]

157
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,437
[knocking on door]

158
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,111
-Hi. Scott Clarke?
-Uh, yes.

159
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,238
The same Scott Clarke
who teaches science and AV

160
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,490
-at Hawkins Middle?
-The very same.

161
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,824
Oh, wonderful.

162
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,411
...and we're making a newsletter,
which we'll send out monthly.

163
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,413
It'll showcase all the latest equipment,

164
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,416
as well as how-to articles,
which the kids write themselves.

165
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,918
Oh, that's neat.

166
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,544
What we're really trying to do here,
Mr. Clarke--

167
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,254
Uh, please, call me Scott.

168
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,923
Scott.

169
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:22,927
What we're trying to do here, Scott,
is to connect kids from all over the state

170
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,012
and give them
the support and encouragement

171
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,097
to pursue careers in technology.

172
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,892
We feel these are the kinds of kids
that are going to make Indiana proud.

173
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,520
I agree, yes.
Completely.

174
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,606
So, you know any kids
you think might wanna participate?

175
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,400
Oh, I have a few in mind.

176
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,872
[Mike sighs] I just...
I can't believe she didn't come back.

177

-[Dustin] She's gotta be close.
-She said it wasn't safe.

178
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,585
She just messed up the compasses
because she wanted to protect us.

179
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,796
-She didn't betray us.
-Mike, calm down.

180
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,131
I shouldn't have yelled at her.
I never should've done that.

181
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,801
-Mike, this isn't your fault.
-Yeah, it's Lucas'.

182
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,010
It wasn't his fault, either.

183
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,222
-It wasn't his fault?
-No.

184
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,015
So you're saying
he wasn't way out of line?

185
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,642
-Totally, but so were you!
-What?

186
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,394
-And so was Eleven.
-Oh, give me a break!

187
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,645
No, Mike, you give me a break!

188
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,189
All three of you were being
a bunch of little assholes!

189
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,816
I was the only reasonable one.

190
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,569
But the bottom line is...
you pushed first.

191
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,529
And you know the rule.
You draw first blood...

192
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,364
No! No way!
I'm not shaking his hand.

193
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,991
-You're shaking his hand!
-No, I'm not.

194

This isn't a discussion.
This is the rule of law.

195

Obey or be banished from the party.
Do you wanna be banished?

196

-No.
-Good.

Where are we going?

198
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,964
Where do you think?
We're going to get Lucas.

199
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,966

Because today, we make history.

205
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,289
Today, we make contact.

Ah... yum.

Okay.
Now, sweetie, swallow the pancake.

215

Where is Nancy?
I thought she was coming down.

216

217
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,065
Uh, she was.

What do you want?

225
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:18,287
[sighs] I drew first blood, so...

226
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,345
Okay, I'll shake.

227
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,264
On one condition.

228
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,433
We forget the weirdo
and go straight to the gate.

229
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,934
-Then the deal's off.
-Fine!

230
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,728
-Fine!
-[Dustin] No, no, not fine!

231
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,104
Guys, seriously?

232
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,441
Do you even remember
what happened on the Bloodstone Pass?

233
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,364
[sighs] We couldn't agree on what path
to take, so we split up the party

234
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,366
and those trolls took us out one by one.

235
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,161
And it all went to shit.
And we were all disabled!

236
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,122
So we stick together, no matter what!

237
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:07,127
Yeah, I agree. But this is the party,
right here in this room.

238
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:11,090
-El is one of us now.
-Um, no, she's not. Not even close!

239
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,467
Never will be.
She's a liar, a traitor--

240
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,344
She was just trying to keep us safe!

241
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,970
She didn't mean to hurt you.
It was an accident!

242
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,263
An accident?

243
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,307
All right, accident or not...

244
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,434
-admit it, it was a little awesome.
-Awesome?

245
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,436
Yeah, she threw you in the air
with her mind!

246
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,271
I could have been killed!

247
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,149
Which is exactly why we need her.
She's a weapon!

248
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,360
Do you seriously wanna fight
the Demogorgon with your wrist rocket?

249
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,737
That's like R2-D2
going to fight Darth Vader.

250
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,697
We're no use to Will if we're dead.

251
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,910
If you two wanna waste your time
looking for a traitor, go ahead,

252
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:43,247
'cause I'm not spending my time
on her anymore. No way!

253
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,751
I'm going to the gate.
I'm gonna find Will.

[Dr. Brenner] <i>It's okay, Eleven.</i>

257
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,041
Don't be frightened.
These are all friends.

258
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,211
They're just here to watch.

259
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,090
Don't focus on them.

260
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,718
Stay in here, like before.

261
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,387
Yes, Papa.

262
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,854
Now, remember.
Whatever it is, it can't hurt you.

263
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:52,524
Not from here.
So there's nothing to be frightened of.

264
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,736
It's reaching out to you...

265
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,655
'cause it wants you.

266
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,365
Hmm?

267
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,658
It's calling you...

268
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,494
so don't turn away from it this time.

269
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,914
I want you to find it.

00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,082

-The Hawkins chief of police.

287

And you want to talk to my sister?

Well, if your sister's Terry Ives,
then, yeah, we do.

Okay, well, you can come in,

290

to tell you anything,

Uh, this is Hopper.
We drove over from Hawkins.

Um, you see, uh, my son...

297
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:41,318
he's been missing for almost a week now,

298
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,571
and, um, we were wondering
if we could talk to you

299
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,281
about your daughter, Jane?

300
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:50,369
If there's anything that you could tell us
about when she was taken...

What was your relationship
with Dr. Brenner?

-Uh...
-What's wrong with her?

307
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,722
I told you, you're wasting your time.

308

[Dustin] This is weird without Lucas.

-He should've shaken my hand.
-He's just jealous.

[sighs] Sometimes, your total
obliviousness just blows my mind.

312
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,441
He's your best friend, right?

00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:06,528
-Yeah... I mean, I don't know.
-It's fine. I get it.

314
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:10,115
I didn't get here until the fourth grade.
He had the advantage of living next door.

315
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,533
But none of that matters.

316
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,286
What matters
is that he is your best friend.

317
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,705
And then this girl shows up
and starts living in your basement,

318
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,665
and all you ever want to do
is pay attention to her.

319
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,251
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is. And you know it.

320
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,879
And he knows it.
But no one ever says anything

321

and yelling at each other

-He's not my best friend.

-[chuckles] Yeah, right.
-[sighs] I mean, he is, but so are you.

-And so is Will.
-Can't have more than one best friend.

-Says who?
-Says logic.

and put her in these isolation tanks.

347
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,047
-Isolation tanks?
-[Becky] Yeah.

348
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,174
These big bathtubs, basically,

349
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,885
filled with salt water,
so you can float around in there.

350
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,638
You lose any sense of, uh...

351
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:00,517
sense and feel nothing, see nothing.

352
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,895
They wanted to expand
the boundaries of the mind.

353
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,355
Real hippie crap.

354
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:08,024
I... I mean, it's not like they were
forcing her to do any of this stuff.

355
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,359
The thing is, though, is that

356
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,528
she didn't know
she was pregnant at the time.

357
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,113
Jane.

358
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,448
[sighs]

359
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,994
Do you have any pictures of her?

360
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,082
I don't think you guys understand.

361
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,377
Terry miscarried in the third trimester.

362
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,552
She keeps all of this up.
Been doing it for 12 years.

363
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,678
[sighs]

364
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,641
Terry, uh, pretends like Jane is real,

365
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,519
-like she's gonna come home someday.
-[lullaby plays from mobile]

366
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:49,065
Says she's special.
Born with "abilities."

367
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,985
Abilities?

368
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:54,863
[bones cracking]

369
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,656
You read any Stephen King?

370
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,408
-[hisses]
-[beeping]

371
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,452
[stammers]

372
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,870
[chuckles]

373
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,289
You guys look scared, actually.

374
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,208
[chuckles] I mean, it's all make-believe.

375
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:10,128
[clears throat]
What... what kind of abilities?

376
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,881
Telepathy, telekinesis...

377
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,633
[Eleven screams]

378
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,801
You know, shit you can do with your mind.

379
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,847
That's why the big, bad Man
stole Jane away.

380
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,390
[yelling] Papa!

381
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,477
Her baby's a weapon,
off fighting the commies.

382
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:29,731
You know, the doctors all say
it's a coping mechanism.

383
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,524
You know, to deal with the guilt.

384
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,569
Do you think there is any chance
she could be telling the truth?

385
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,947
[stammering] About having had the kid.

386
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,825
There is no birth certificate,
nothing from the hospital.

387
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,995
Doctors and nurses
all confirm that she miscarried.

388
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,248
Yeah, but that could've been covered up.
Right?

389
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:51,252
Like I said, you and Terry
would've gotten along.

390
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,360
Oh, man.

391
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,903
[grunts]

392
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,375
[clattering]

393
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:08,079
And I'll have four boxes of the .38s.

394
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,922
What you kids doin' with all this?

395
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,424
Um...

396
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,221
-Monster hunting.
-Huh. [scoffs]

397
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,514
[cash register dings]

398
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,684
"Monster hunting"?

399
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,063
You know, last week...

400
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,984
I was shopping for a new top
I thought Steve might like.

401
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,903
It took me and Barb all weekend.

402
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:43,865
It seemed like life or death, you know?
And... and now--

403
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,493
You're shopping for bear traps
with Jonathan Byers.

404
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,536
Yeah.

405
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,039
What's the weirdest part?

406
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,374
Me or the bear trap?

407
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,628
You.
It's definitely you.

408
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,087
[chuckles]

409
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,923
-[car horn honking]
-[Reed] Hey, Nance!

410
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,510
Can't wait to see your movie. [laughs]

411
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,969
What the hell was that?

412
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:07,764
I don't know.

413
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,519
What?

414
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,731
What?

415
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,441
Hey! Where are you going?

416
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,737
-[panting]
-Nancy, wait!

417
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,156
[whimpers]

418
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,617
Nancy!

419
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,210
[man 1] I can't believe it.
[man 2] These kids!

420
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,587
-[Jonathan] Jesus.
-[sighs]

421
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,050
Wow.

422
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,222
-[spray can hissing]
-[Tommy laughing]

423
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,348
[Jonathan] Wait!

424
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,016
[Carol] Tommy,
you write like a three-year-old.

425
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,060
[Tommy] Shut up!
[Nicole] I didn't know you could spell.

426
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,144
[Tommy speaks indistinctly]

427
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,731
[indistinct chatter]

428
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,024
[laughter]

429
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,111
Aw, hey there, princess!

430
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,780
[Tommy] Uh-oh! She looks upset.

431
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,325
[Carol] Oh!
[Tommy] Damn!

432
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,743
What is wrong with you?

433
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,120
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

434
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,746
I was worried about you.

435
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,915
I can't believe that I was
actually worried about you. [scoffs]

436
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,252
-What are you talking about?
-I wouldn't lie if I were you.

437
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:22,463
You don't want to be known
as the lying slut now, do you?

438
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,756
Speak of the devil.

439
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,092
Hi.

440
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,928
You came by last night?

441
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,557
Ding! Ding! Ding!
Does she get a prize?

442
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,393
Look, I don't know what you think you saw,
but it wasn't like that.

443
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,855
What, you just let him into your room
to... study?

444
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:41,524
Or for another
pervy photo session? [laughs]

445
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,151
-We were just--
-[Steve] You were just what?

446
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,819
Finish that sentence.

447
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,782
Finish the sentence.

448
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,577
[breathing heavily]

449
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,291
[scoffs] Go to hell, Nancy.

450
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,501
Come on, Nancy, let's just leave.

451
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,128
You know what, Byers?
I'm actually kind of impressed.

452
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,713
I always took you for a queer,
but I guess you're just

453
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,840
a little screw-up like your father.

454
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,593
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that house is full of screw-ups.

455
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,178
You know, I guess I shouldn't
really be surprised.

456
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,471
A bunch of screw-ups in your family.

457
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,722
-Jonathan, leave it.
-I mean, your mom...

458
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,641
I'm not even surprised
what happened to your brother.

459
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,767
[Nancy] Steve, shut up!

460
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,851
I'm sorry I have to be
the one to tell you,

461
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,728
but the Byers, their family,
it's a disgrace to the entire--

462
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:19,854

-Kick his ass, man!

-[Carol] Get off! Stop!
-[both continue grunting]

-Get in there, he's going to hurt himself!
-Easy, easy!

Get out of here! Get out of here!

00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,756
Jonathan, stop!
Stop! You're going to hurt him!

00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,800
-Jonathan, stop!
-[sirens wailing]

475

[Tommy] Cops!
[Nancy] Guys-- Jonathan, get off of him!

476
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,262
-Stop it!
-[Tommy] Cops! Come on!

477
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,264
-Stop it! Come on!
-Cops!

478
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,517
-You have to stop!
-Just go, Carol!

479
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,060
-[Nancy] Stop it!
-[both grunting]

I said he's had enough!

-Go, go, go, go, go, go!

486

Hey! Hey, uh-uh. Uh-uh.
Come here, little guys! Come here!

487
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,910
-[Jonathan] Get off!
-I got this one!

488
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,913
[Callahan] Get back here!
Get back here, you little punks!

We appreciate it.

00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,266

I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.

00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,907
[softly] What?

500
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,035
We're gonna find him.

501
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:02,248
Yeah, like Terry found her daughter?

502
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,126
We're close.

503
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:10,172
[breath trembling] Twelve years?
Twelve years she's been looking for her--

504
00:34:10,297 --> 00:34:11,966
And then she shows up
at Benny's five nights ago,

505
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,259
which means we've got a chance.

506
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,053
You know what I would give?

507
00:34:16,094 --> 00:34:18,347
For a chance?

508
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,141
You know what I would give?

Do you think we'll be out of here soon?

You, yes. Him, no.

He assaulted a police officer.

00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,841
-[ice cubes clatter]
-Well, how long are you gonna keep him?

518
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,094
You and your boyfriend
have big plans, do you?

519
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,387
[chuckles] He's not my boyfriend.

520
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,973
I think you better tell him that.

521
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:02,725
What?

522
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,561
Only love makes you that crazy,
sweetheart.

523
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,481
And that damn stupid.

524
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,608
[sighs]

525
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,324
Found some ice.

526
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:21,869
Thanks.

527
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,581
[sniffs]

528
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,337
[sighs]

529
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,926
Everything okay?

530
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,804
Yeah.

531
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,515
Everything's fine.

532
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,686
[sighs]

533
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,446
[Dustin shouting in the distance] El!

534
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,367
[Mike shouting] Eleven!

535
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,706
-Eleven! El!
-El!

536
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,584
Eleven!

537
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,877
Eleven!

539
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:16,799
-Hey, stop. Do you hear that?
-What?

540
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,967
El!

541
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,011
El?

542
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,808
Hey, there, Frogface.

543
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,768
Toothless.

544
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,729
Shit! Run, Mike!

545
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,856
-What?
-Run! Come on!

546
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,108
[Troy] You're dead, Wheeler.

547
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,902
[Dustin] Move, Mike!

548
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,570
Mike, come on, run!

549
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,496

[panting]

554
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,732
[groans] Cramp!

555
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,484
-Just keep going!
-[grunts]

556
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,735
Keep going!

557
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,326
Shit!

558
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:11,205
-Stay back!
-Don't come any closer!

-[gasps]
-Get off! Get off me!

563
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,384
Let him go! Let him go!

564
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,429
-Stay back, or I cut him!
-What do you want?

565
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,722
I want to know how you did it!

566
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,098
-How I did what?
-[Dustin whimpers]

567
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,474
I know you did something to me.

568
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,435
Some nerdy science shit
to make me do that.

569
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,811
You mean piss your pants?

570
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,480
Our friend has superpowers,

571
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,983
and she squeezed your tiny bladder
with her mind.

572
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,443
-Shut up!
-[groaning]

573
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,862
I think I should save Toothless here
a trip to the dentist.

574
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,655
Help him lose the rest of his baby teeth.

575
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,574
Let him go.
Let him go!

576
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,868
I'll let him go, sure.

577
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:51,245
-But first... it's your turn.
-[panting]

578
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,455
My turn for what?

579
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,165
Wet yourself.

580
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,001
-What?
-Jump...

581
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,545
or Toothless here
gets an early trip to the dentist.

582
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:00,921
[Dustin] Stop! No!

583
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:02,923
[gasping]

584
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,719
I'll cut him right now!

585
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,138
[whimpering]

586
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,682
All right, just hold on!
Hold on!

587
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,101
Mike, don't do it.
I don't need my baby teeth, Mike!

588
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,103
Mike, seriously, don't!

589

[breathing heavily]

590
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,873
[Dustin] Mike, don't do it!

591
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,793
Seriously, don't do it, man!
Seriously, don't!

592
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,753
Troy, I don't think
this is a good idea, man.

593
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,172
[Dustin] Mike, don't!

594
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:46,884
-Dentist's office opens in five...
-[Dustin panting]

595
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,387
Four! Three!

-Two!
-Mike!

597
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,350

[Troy] She broke my arm! My arm!

605
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:49,989
Go.

606
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,909
[Troy] Let's get out of here! Let's go!
[James] Go!

607
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,911
Yeah, that's right!
You better run!

608
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:59,123
She's our friend and she's crazy!

609
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,584
You come back here and she'll kill you!

610
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:05,588
You hear me?
She'll kill you, you sons of bitches!

611
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,715
[echoing] She'll kill you, you hear me?

El?

622

[sobbing] Mike... I'm sorry.

623

Sorry? What are you sorry for?

624
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,678
The gate...

625
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,975
I opened it.

626
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,063
I'm the monster.

627
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,150
No. No, El, you're not the monster.

628
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,819
You saved me.

629
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,780
Do you understand?
You saved me.

630
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:38,282

They're heading home.

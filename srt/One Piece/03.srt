I'll batten your hatches, you idiot!

Fear not! No pirate will get past me.

There are no pirates.
Haven't been in years.

-Yeah, I thought it had a nice ring to it.

-Who says pirates have to be scary?

The point is we need a new ship.

So where do we get one?

58
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,411
Our closest bet is the Gecko Islands.

59
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,289
We can probably make it there
before our ship sinks.

out to sea like I told you?

179
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,091
The fastest.

180
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,802
Not a ship in the East Blue
can keep up with this baby.

181
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,262
[exhales]

182
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,264
She's perfect!

183
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,682
You can say that again.

184
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,311
[Nami] There you are.

185
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,314
Guys!

186
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,150
I found it.

187
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,819
I found our ship.

188
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,238
And this guy will sell it to us.

189
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,117
[Usopp] Uh, wait. What? Uh…

190
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,036
Yeah! The ship, we'll take it.

191
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:07,249
-Technically, she's not for sale.
-Huh?

192
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,168
And technically,

193
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,004
I'm not a salesman.

194
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,799
-Do you even work here?
-Of course I do.

195
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,717
I'm Chief Technician

196
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,637
in charge of encrustation removal
and aviary waste eradication.

197
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,638
Encru what?

198
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,225
-He scrubs barnacles and cleans bird shit.
-He can't help us.

199
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,727
Wait! Wait! Wait! I can help you.

200
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:31,565
The owner of this ship just happens to be
my closest friend in the world.

201
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,484
Your friend owns this ship?

202
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,028
Not just this one.
She owns the whole shipyard.

203
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,155
She's <i>rich </i>rich.

204
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,156
Oh!

205
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,575
I'm sure you could strike a deal with her.

206
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,703
See?

207
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,165
Well, I guess it couldn't hurt
to say hello.

208
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,878
What the hell did I do with it?

209
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,384
Sir… is there something
I can help you with?

210
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,847
[Garp] You've quite a handle
on basic seamanship.

211
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,225
You learn that
on that pirate ship of yours?

212
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:08,811
Yes, sir.

213
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,899
I was forced to work alongside the crew.
They'd lock me in the bilge if I didn't.

214
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,363
Our experiences don't define us.

215
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,158
It's what we gain from them that matters.

216
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,910
You learned, and you survived.

217
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,913
Oh. Oh.

218
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,334
Here it is.

219
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,546
You play?

220
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,008
-A little, sir.
-Good.

221
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,846
[military music plays]

222
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,572
Let's see if you
can do more than tie knots.

223
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,791
[Luffy] I've never seen
a house this big before.

224
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,209
[Usopp] Impressive, right?

225
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,420
Kaya's given me an open invitation
to drop by anytime I want.

226
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,338
[Luffy] Wow.

227
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,673
All of this just for one person?

228
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:23,010
Well, she lives here
with her butler and a few other staff.

229
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,222
[Luffy whistles]

230
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,849
Money really shows you
who people truly are.

231
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,436
Most people only care about themselves
and what's theirs.

232
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,897
Sounds like someone I know.

233
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:39,193
[Nami] And a small staff
makes for easy pickings.

234
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,155
[Zoro] Why? Gonna rob the place blind?

235
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,408
At least a little blurry.

236
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:52,581
[Luffy] So if you have an invitation,
why are we going around the back way?

237
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,166
[Usopp] I never use the front entrance.

238
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,294
This is more of a VIP entrance
reserved for special guests.

239
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,587
[Zoro] This guy's full of shit.

240
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,216
Yeah. But as long as he gets us
inside the house, who cares?

241
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,430
Oops. You know, there's actually
a more exclusive entrance this way.

242
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,891
-[grunts]
-[Usopp gasps]

243
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,981
-The hell are you doing here, Usopp?
-Buchi, buddy, uh, Kaya's expecting me.

244
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:21,235
-Another one of your lies.
-Oh.

245
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,446
-You ain't welcome here and you know it.
-I know nothing of the sort.

246
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,740
I'm here to give Kaya
an extra-special gift.

247
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,409
[woman] Usopp!

248
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,330
[woman sighs]

249
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,457
[sighs]

250
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,293
What a wonderful surprise.

251
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,420
[wistful music plays]

252
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,589
[Usopp] Hmm!

253
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,674
Kaya!

254
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:44,758
[Kaya chuckles]

255
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,177
Happy birthday.

256
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,472
-You remembered.
-Of course I did.

257
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:51,974
[butler clears throat]

258
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,103
Usopp.

259
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,566
We've had this discussion.
You mustn't show up unannounced.

260
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,151
Nonsense, Klahadore.

261
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,615
Have you come to tell me another story?
I do love hearing about your adventures.

262
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,492
I'll do you one better.
I brought some of my crew.

263
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,369
Is he talking about us?

264
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,581
It's so nice to meet you.
You all must stay for dinner.

265
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,374
[Klahadore] Miss Kaya,

266
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,002
it is a bit last minute.

267
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,714
I'm afraid the kitchen
hasn't prepared for any extra guests.

268
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,050
[Kaya] Please, Klahadore.

269
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:27,885
It's my birthday.

270
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,346
Can't be too much trouble, can it?

271
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,725
Of course, Miss Kaya.

272
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,644
Anything for you.

273
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,563
All right! When do we eat?

274
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,399
You don't. Not dressed like that.

275
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:48,238
Sham, kindly show Usopp
and his friends to the guest suites.

276
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,951
You will bathe and change before dinner.

277
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,286
[Sham] Hmm.

278
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,956
A bath does sound nice.

279
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,251
[Luffy] All right!

280
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,836
[indistinct chatter]

281
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,307
[knocking on door]

282
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,686
Yo.

283
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,066
One of these days,
Klahadore is going to figure out

284
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,777
you use the servant's passageways
to sneak in here.

285
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,654
-[Usopp] Uh, uh.
-[Kaya giggles]

286
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,239
[Usopp] So what if he does?

287
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,700
I'll find another way in.

288
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,285
What are you doing here anyway?
Shouldn't you be getting ready?

289
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,622
I wanted to give you
your birthday present.

290
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,624
[gentle music plays]

291
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:43,877
Uh…

292
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,343
[Kaya] It's, um…

293
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,638
A giant pearl!

294
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,223
So it is.

295
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,934
[exhales] It wasn't easy to get either.

296
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,187
It was guarded
by a giant goldfish monster.

297
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,188
[gasps]

298
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,192
I had to weather a storm,
my ship almost capsizing, to find it.

299
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,484
Whoa!

300
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,530
-Phew! [grunts]
-[giggles]

301
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,156
I barely made landfall.

302
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,577
-[gasps]
-Only it wasn't land I was on.

303
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,746
It was… [sniffs]

304
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,497
…a massive piece

305
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,041
of goldfish shit.

306
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,669
[laughs] Ew!

307
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:27,713
[both laughing]

308
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,757
[coughing]

309
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:31,884
Kaya, are you okay?

310
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,302
Tea.

311
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,653
[clears throat]

312
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,489
[exhales]

313
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,158
How have you been feeling lately?

314
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,369
No different really.

315
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,874
When you've been sick as long as I have,
you get used to it.

316
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,755
This tea is the only thing
that makes me feel better.

317
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,968
That and your stories, of course.

318
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:17,971
Well,

319
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:22,601
I'll keep going on these grand adventures
as long as you want to hear 'em.

320
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,771
I wouldn't miss them for the world.

321
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,610
Why would anyone
even need this many clothes?

322
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,737
[Nami] It's not about need
with these people.

323
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,988
It's about want.

324
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,200
What are we even supposed to wear?

325
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,868
[Nami] Anything you want.

326
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,705
When are you ever going to get
the opportunity to wear things this nice?

327
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,500
Well?

328
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,710
What do you think?

329
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,799
You look like Nami.

330
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,890
Hey, Zoro!

331
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,517
What you gonna wear?

332
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:07,855
Something black.

333
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,190
[Nami] How edgy.

334
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,611
Hey, does that butler
seem familiar to you guys?

335
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,489
Yeah, I think he was
at the last dinner party I attended.

336
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,324
I swear I've seen him somewhere.

337
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,249
How's this?

338
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,127
-Still Nami.
-I said I'm wearing black.

339
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,004
I hate you guys.

340
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,256
I feel kind of bad for Kaya.

341
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:37,759
All this stuff.

342
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,178
All this space.

343
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,098
It's gotta make a person feel… lonely.

344
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,309
[Nami] Rich people don't have
the same emotions we do.

345
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:49,188
This stuff doesn't make her feel lonely.
It makes her feel important.

346
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,733
[Luffy] Well, Usopp likes her.

347
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,526
And she invited us to dinner.

348
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,821
I'm sure we can work out
a way to get that ship.

349
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:01,408
No way. Rich people don't stay rich
by giving things away.

350
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,077
You want to bet?

351
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,832
What are the terms?

352
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,504
I bet I can convince Kaya
to give us that ship.

353
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,714
And when you can't?

354
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,467
We go with your plan.

355
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,969
Steal one and move on.

356
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,306
You're on.

357
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,115
Nice.

358
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,704
[Klahadore] Eighteen years old.
I can hardly believe it.

359
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,582
You've grown into a fine young woman,
Miss Kaya.

360
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,501
Oh, Klahadore.

361
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,887
You know, I had nothing
when your parents took me in.

362
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,973
When they passed, well,

363
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,351
let's just say it has been an honor

364
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,728
to repay their kindness, and yours,

365
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,147
by serving you these past three years.

366
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,902
You do so much for me.

367
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,613
And not as a butler. As a friend.

368
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,702
I don't know how I'll ever repay you.

369
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:30,747
I know I can be
a tad overprotective at times,

370
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,625
but it's just because
I couldn't bear to think

371
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,295
what I would do
were something to happen to you.

372
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,423
You could lighten up just a bit.

373
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,507
[chuckles]

374
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:43,677
[sighs]

375
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,304
I shall try.

376
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,889
That could be my birthday gift to you.

377
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,057
[chuckles]

378
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,186
[Buchi mumbling]

379
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,692
Careful, you idiot!

380
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,196
Sorry. It's a chef's reflex.

381
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,948
You want to poison yourself?

382
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,285
[Klahadore] And how are
the dinner preparations coming along?

383
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,912
Uh… fine, sir.

384
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,998
[mysterious music plays]

385
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,301
Sham?

386
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,269
What is this?

387
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,190
I'm sorry, sir. It won't happen again.

388
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,817
No. It won't.

389
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,111
[gasps]

390
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:52,079
Everything must be perfect,
tonight of all nights, hmm?

391
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,174
[exhales]

392
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,018
[military music plays]

393
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,020
[Garp] Still your move, son.

394
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:19,648
Sorry, sir.

395
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,955
Game.

396
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,706
You're overthinking things, son.

397
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,460
You're too focused on not losing.

398
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,880
You won't win wars
if you keep playing defensive.

399
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,134
-I'm not very good, sir.
-[Garp] Nonsense.

400
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,636
You just keep getting in your own way.

401
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:51,680
Now,

402
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,391
two minutes.

403
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,150
Right. Your move.

404
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:04,985
Do it.

405
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,113
[adventurous music plays]

406
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,591
I won!

407
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,012
[Garp] That you did.

408
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,474
Because you acted decisively.

409
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,058
It's the same with pirates.

410
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,394
Action is the only language
they understand,

411
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,271
so we need to speak it louder.

412
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:45,192
Especially with these young upstarts.

413
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,653
They need a swift hand to put them
back in their place. Understood?

414
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,782
-Yes, sir.
-Clear the board. We go again.

415
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,120
[mysterious music plays]

416
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,246
[Luffy] Ah.

417
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,748
[indistinct chatter]

418
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,665
[Luffy] Mmm.

419
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,501
These are so good.

420
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:03,919
I know, right?

421
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,755
Reminds me of that one time
I slayed a dragon,

422
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:10,050
cooked it over an open flame,
ate the whole thing myself.

423
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,760
-You ever had dragon?
-Nope.

424
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,763
-Do you have dragon?
-Afraid we're fresh out.

425
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,556
Oh well.

426
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,894
Hey, Zoro. You gotta try this!

427
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:21,811
Mmm.

428
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,730
I've got all I need right here.

429
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,823
[Nami] So you manage
all of Kaya's finances?

430
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:34,741
[man] Oh yes.

431
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:39,287
I've handled her family's accounts,
both personal and professional, for years.

432
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,205
Fascinating.

433
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,333
You know, I've always been interested

434
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,294
in learning about the intricacies
of the shipbuilding business.

435
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,546
-Oh.
-[Klahadore clears throat]

436
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:50,549
May I present…

437
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,262
Miss Kaya.

438
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:13,321
Kaya, you look absolutely radiant.

439
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:17,158
Merry, I'm so glad you could make it.

440
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,161
This is a milestone
I wouldn't miss for the world.

441
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,915
Your parents would be so proud.

442
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:32,757
-Nami, I love that dress on you.
-Thanks.

443
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,969
It belonged to my mother.
It was one of her favorites.

444
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,139
-Oh, I'm sorry. I--
-Not at all.

445
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:42,726
I'm sure she would agree
it suits you splendidly.

446
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,150
Have we met before?

447
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,778
You look familiar.

448
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,116
Highly doubtful, sir.

449
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,659
Funky Bar?

450
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,661
Mirror Ball Island?

451
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,873
Funky Bar?

452
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:10,086
Well, I can assure you I've never
patronized that type of establishment.

453
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,131
Kaya, I wonder if I might have your ear?

454
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:17,093
There are matters concerning
the transfer of ownership of the shipyard

455
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,386
we need to discuss.

456
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,599
Merry, dear friend,
it's always business with you.

457
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:26,519
-[Merry sighs]
-[Klahadore] Tonight is about celebration.

458
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,688
Shall we all move to the dining room?

459
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,066
Yes!

460
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,943
Oh! Oh, I'm so ready for this…

461
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,612
[curious music plays]

462
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,749
-[Zoro] Keep this coming.
-Uh.

463
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,381
I'd love to try the fish tonight.

464
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,842
I'm sorry, Miss Kaya,
but that is not possible.

465
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,719
Maybe just a small piece?

466
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,473
Now, you know that certain foods
can affect your constitution.

467
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,601
Here, Buchi has prepared
your special soup.

468
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,402
Kaya, it's your birthday.
You should be able to eat what you want.

469
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:19,864
Miss Kaya's medical condition necessitates
that I closely monitor her dietary needs.

470
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,491
Does it mean you also speak for her?

471
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,202
I'll take her fish.

472
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,204
[gulps]

473
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,041
Luffy, isn't there something
that you wanted to talk to Kaya about?

474
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:34,379
Oh, yes! Usopp told me
that you own the whole shipyard.

475
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,841
Well, actually my parents
founded the shipyard,

476
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,343
and Merry's been
running the business since…

477
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,721
well, since they passed.

478
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,057
But all of that's about to change.

479
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:51,688
Tonight, at midnight,
I will become the sole owner.

480
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:58,027
Ah. Well, that's great,
because we want to buy a ship from you.

481
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,405
I see.

482
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,409
-Usopp mentioned that you're sailors.
-Nope, not sailors.

483
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,326
We're pirates.

484
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,621
[Zoro] This ought to be good.

485
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,875
-Pirates?
-[Luffy] Yep.

486
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,002
We haven't sailed together for long,

487
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,921
but we have already
defeated an evil clown,

488
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,590
raided a Marine base,

489
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:22,051
and taken down
a captain with an axe for a hand.

490
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,471
These sound a lot
like your adventures, Usopp.

491
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,640
[laughs] Yeah, that's… That's crazy.

492
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,768
Oh yeah. And we're just getting started.

493
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,314
What are you doing?
Get down from there at once!

494
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:37,650
Being a pirate has been my dream
for as long as I can remember.

495
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,862
And I'm finally making it a reality.

496
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,994
We're heading out to the Grand Line,
where even more adventures await us.

497
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,873
And at the end of the journey,
I'm gonna find the ultimate treasure,

498
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,626
the One Piece, and become

499
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,045
King of the Pirates.

500
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,297
You're serious?

501
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,551
[groans]

502
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:05,970
[Luffy] Kaya,

503
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,306
you have a beautiful ship out there.

504
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,517
A caravel with a sheep figurehead.

505
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,851
It spoke to me.

506
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,354
That's the ship we need
to follow our dreams.

507
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:17,357
I promise you,
we'll take care of it. Maintain it.

508
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,568
Treat it like
any other member of our crew,

509
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,404
because a ship is also a home.

510
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,824
[Klahadore] That will be quite enough!

511
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:30,203
I should've known Usopp
would bring riffraff to our doorstep.

512
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,914
Klahadore, it's okay. I--

513
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,999
[coughing]

514
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,378
Now look what you've done.
You've upset Miss Kaya.

515
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:41,172
-All of you, out of this house at once!
-No.

516
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,635
It's late. Let them stay the night.

517
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,972
As you wish, Miss Kaya,

518
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,599
but they are out
first thing in the morning.

519
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,355
[door opens]

520
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,315
-That went pretty well.
-[door closes]

521
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:00,900
Don't you think?

522
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,657
[footsteps approaching]

523
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:09,993
Vice-Admiral, I…

524
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,206
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something?

525
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,626
No. You've just saved me
from getting beaten again.

526
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:20,837
What is it?

527
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,965
We spotted the wreckage
of an abandoned sloop.

528
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,552
Found this on board.

529
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:32,765
They couldn't have gotten far.
What's the nearest island to our location?

530
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,933
It's Gecko Island, sir.

531
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,231
[Garp] Gather a landing party
and make for shore.

532
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,109
I want those pirates found.

533
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,569
-Yes, sir.
-[Garp] Not you.

534
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,029
Him.

535
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:46,946
[both] What?!

536
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,910
Your position as senior cadet
has proven unwarranted.

537
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,621
Nepotism can only get you so far.

538
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,250
This is your chance
to show me what you've got, cadet.

539
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,587
Don't waste it.

540
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,255
Yes, sir.

541
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,383
[suspenseful music plays]

542
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,362
[sighs]

543
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,655
[gasps] Heavens!

544
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,699
Are you trying to give me a fright?

545
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,784
[Klahadore] So sorry.

546
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,077
I tend to be

547
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,538
light on my feet.

548
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,166
I must speak with Miss Kaya immediately.

549
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:44,337
This whole notion of transferring
the shipbuilding business to you

550
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,131
is highly unusual, to say the least.

551
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,217
I have run this estate
for Miss Kaya for years,

552
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,843
so it is only natural

553
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:54,889
that she should ask me to run
the family business until she's ready.

554
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,308
I would like to discuss the matter
with Miss Kaya.

555
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,520
These are our wishes, Merry.

556
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,313
Then she can tell me herself.

557
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,899
That young woman has been through enough,

558
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,777
and I won't let anyone
take advantage of her.

559
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,821
[suspenseful music continues]

560
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,531
[gasps] How did you…

561
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,163
[gasps]

562
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,583
[yelps]

563
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,669
[yelps]

564
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,838
[yelps]

565
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,718
Klahadore?

566
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,096
I won't stand for this any longer.

567
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,808
[gasps]

568
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:43,479
[knives clang]

569
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,565
[sinister music plays]

570
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,581
[gasps]

571
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,003
Is this the best way
to ask for an autograph?

572
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:10,505
I mean, sheesh! Fans have gotten so toxic.

573
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,094
All right, what do you want?

574
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,346
Tickets to the show?

575
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:20,308
I can get you house seats. They're pricey.

576
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,516
-[thud]
-[gasps]

577
00:34:23,393 --> 00:34:27,648
[pirate] Oh, I'm no fan of yours.

578
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,197
[growls]

579
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,947
[snarls]

580
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:37,992
Arlong?

581
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,038
[Arlong] I run things here
in the East Blue.

582
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:47,251
I'm here to remind you
of your place in the food chain.

583
00:34:50,295 --> 00:34:54,467
You pull a job in my seas,
you gotta pay tribute.

584
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:59,055
But, Arlong, baby,
you don't gotta worry about me.

585
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:02,183
I'm small potatoes.
Pirating's more of a side gig.

586
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,062
[clicking tongue]

587
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,608
Kuroobi tells me
you ransacked Orange Town.

588
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,318
[gasps] Ransacked?

589
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,445
You should've seen the place
before I got there, okay?

590
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,738
It was a real fixer-upper.

591
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,950
You bore me, clown. [growls]

592
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,369
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait. Wait.

593
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,541
You know who's out there
really disrespecting you?

594
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:30,753
It's that little rubber prick
in a straw hat. Goes by the name of Luffy.

595
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,382
-Never heard of him.
-[Buggy choking]

596
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,677
He just knocked over
a Marine base in Shells Town.

597
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,804
And then he stole a map of the Grand Line,

598
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,640
and now he's talking shit
about finding the One Piece.

599
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,310
[Buggy coughing]

600
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,813
[Arlong] The One Piece.

601
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:55,695
[chuckles] An excuse for humans
to spread their filth across the seas.

602
00:35:56,529 --> 00:36:00,533
Listen, why don't you let me live,

603
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:05,121
and then I help you find Luffy?

604
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,333
Ah. Ah. Ah.

605
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,424
And how do you plan to do that?

606
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:21,137
I've got eyes and ears everywhere.

607
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,724
[both laughing]

608
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,645
[gasps]

609
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,482
[mysterious music plays]

610
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,074
Hey, Zoro!

611
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,659
Sh! Shut up.

612
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,711
You always carry those swords with you?

613
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:56,297
Wherever I go, the Wado Ichimonji goes.

614
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,551
-Where are you going anyways?
-I'm looking for a drink.

615
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,678
This place is a maze.

616
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:07,683
How about you?

617
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,103
Midnight snack.

618
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,023
Of course.

619
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,570
Come on.
We'll follow my nose to the kitchen.

620
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,104
[footsteps approaching]

621
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,581
-[Kaya] Nami?
-[gasps]

622
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,085
What are you doing?
Is everything all right?

623
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:20,172
Sorry, this house is so massive.
I was just trying to find the bathroom.

624
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,175
With a pillowcase?

625
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:33,185
So… you are a pirate after all.

626
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,689
I hate pirates.

627
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,358
But I am who I am.

628
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:41,902
And

629
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,113
I won't apologize for that.

630
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:47,867
To be honest, I find some of the decor
to be a bit gaudy.

631
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,577
I'd prefer to donate it to charity.

632
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,162
I'm not charity.

633
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,122
No, of course not.

634
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,959
I simply meant
what's the point in having so much

635
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,128
if you can't share it with others?

636
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,088
Like those in need. Family.

637
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,424
Friends.

638
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,759
So we're friends now?

639
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,470
You don't even know me.

640
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,015
Usopp does, and that's a start.

641
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,517
[gentle music plays]

642
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,028
So what do we do now?

643
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,031
Have a sleepover? Do each other's makeup?

644
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,032
[chuckles]

645
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,867
[coughing]

646
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,578
Kaya, are you okay?

647
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,376
Not you too.

648
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,378
What?

649
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,214
[Kaya] Everyone's so careful around me.

650
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,383
Like one wrong move and I'll break.

651
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,135
I don't want your pity.

652
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,137
Well, you won't get it then.

653
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,149
Couldn't sleep either, huh?

654
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,109
[chuckles]

655
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,610
Not after that dinner.

656
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:11,075
I hope I didn't get you
in trouble with Kaya.

657
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,285
Sometimes I get carried away.

658
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,830
Oh, no. It was worth it.

659
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,165
Seeing that look on Klahadore's face.

660
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:19,834
[laughs]

661
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,379
I thought his head was gonna explode.

662
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:30,636
All that stuff true that you said?
About the clown and the axe-hand guy?

663
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,680
Mm-hmm.

664
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,597
Every word.

665
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,852
I mean, they're not as exciting
as your adventures.

666
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,355
Yeah.

667
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,526
And the One Piece,
are you really going after that?

668
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,111
Yep.

669
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,655
I'm gonna be the one to find it too.

670
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,533
Man!

671
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,453
I wish I could do that.

672
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:57,746
But

673
00:40:58,706 --> 00:40:59,665
I can't leave.

674
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,668
Kaya needs me.

675
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,297
-Is she your girlfriend or something?
-What?

676
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,591
Oh.

677
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:09,967
Um… [chuckles]

678
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,178
Usopp and me? No. No.

679
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,390
We've known each other for years.
Ever since his mother died.

680
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:21,562
He didn't have anybody, so my parents
gave him a job at the shipyard.

681
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,481
He likes to come around

682
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:28,903
and tell me all about his brave exploits
and grand adventures.

683
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,156
And truth is,

684
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,699
they make me feel better.

685
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:38,537
She's more like… my best friend.

686
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:44,502
Her parents died a few years ago,
and she… took it pretty hard, and…

687
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,755
and then she got sick on top of that.

688
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,594
I just want to be there for her, you know?

689
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,139
[Nami] <i>Your parents,</i>

690
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,557
what happened to them?

691
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,104
They, um…

692
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,691
They died at sea.

693
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:16,033
All these years
and it still takes my breath away.

694
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,871
I couldn't even
go through their belongings.

695
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:26,961
Just… locked up the memories
in the East Wing, where their bedroom was.

696
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,800
I'm sorry.

697
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,598
Have you ever lost anyone close to you?

698
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:42,768
No.

699
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,230
I'm jealous.

700
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:47,773
[scoffs]

701
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:48,983
Said the rich girl.

702
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,109
[chuckles]

703
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:54,154
You're not very good
at this friends thing, are you?

704
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,448
[chuckles]

705
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,659
[both laugh]

706
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,162
No, I guess I'm not.

707
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,956

He's a notorious pirate.

-A dead one.

They say you were killed
by Axe-Hand Morgan.

But he could ruin the plan.

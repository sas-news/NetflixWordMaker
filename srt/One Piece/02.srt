00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,314
to steal that map from old Axe-Hand Moron…

179
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,732
[men chuckle]

180
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,858
Huh?

181
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,401
Eh.

182
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,153
…only to find out

183
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:17,742
that I was upstaged
by three little nobodies,

184
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,953
who stole it from right out under my no--

185
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,913
No! It's in my head now.

186
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,040
Ah! [groans]

187
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,584
[Luffy] Hey, I'm not a nobody.

188
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,961
I'm Monkey D. Luffy.

189
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,089
And I will be King of the Pirates.

190
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,466
[Buggy laughs]

191
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,343
Oh! [laughs]

192
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,053
Now that's funny.

193
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,221
[audience laughing]

194
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,851
[laughing stops]

195
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,148
My bounty poster

196
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:54,904
graces the marquee
of every Marine outpost for miles.

197
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:59,659
And my menagerie of outcasts and freaks

198
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:03,412
is the most dreaded pirate crew
the East Blue has ever known.

199
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:08,292
I am destined to find the One Piece.

200
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,460
And when I do…

201
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,924
I will be king.

202
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,467
No, you won't,

203
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,011
'cause I'm gonna find it first.

204
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,596
You? Don't make me laugh.

205
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,807
[audience laughs]

206
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,602
-I said don't make me laugh!
-[Zoro] All right, listen up.

207
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,897
I'm Roronoa Zoro.

208
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:35,653
Drop your weapons now
and I may let you live.

209
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,240
[laughs]

210
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,701
Ladies and gentlemen,

211
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,414
we have a celebrity in our midst.

212
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,582
Too bad I hate sharing the spotlight.

213
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,839
Now, maybe we should skip
right to the finale.

214
00:11:55,548 --> 00:12:00,845
My freaks put quite a bit of rehearsal
time into this little abduction.

215
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,932
And if I can't reward them with that map…

216
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,686
[growls]

217
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,231
I suppose I'll have to offer them
a pound of flesh instead.

218
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,568
Wait. Wait. What if I have
something else to offer you?

219
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,028
Something more valuable than the map?

220
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:22,366
What if I give you
a new freak for your crew?

221
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,912
A rare talent. The most spectacular act
in all of the East Blue.

222
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,956
Besides you, of course. [chuckles]

223
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,417
Go on.

224
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,921
[Luffy] Hey!

225
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,050
[suspenseful music plays]

226
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,927
[Luffy grunts]

227
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,227
[panting]

228
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,775
Oh my God.

229
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,365
[gasps] Get--

230
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,366
[gasps]

231
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,868
[grunting]

232
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,375
What did you do?

233
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,296
What did you do to their town?
You destroyed everything!

234
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:18,881
Not everything.

235
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,593
I let 'em keep their hands.

236
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,139
Okay.

237
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,268
Here end the theatrics.

238
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,398
I know one of you has my map,
and I'm gonna get it back.

239
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,568
What was it you said, Rubber Boy?
That it was in a safe place?

240
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,987
Don't look so surprised.

241
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,698
I've got eyes and ears everywhere.

242
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:50,371
So please make our guests uncomfortable
in the green room.

243
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,123
[grunting]

244
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:06,971
I am gonna have a chat
with my stretchy new pal.

245
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,223
[laughs]

246
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,308
[military marching music playing]

247
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,862
[fanfare playing]

248
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:23,946
[Marines] Hut!

249
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,120
Who's that?

250
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,289
Don't you know anything?

251
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,085
That's Vice-Admiral Garp.
Hero of the Marines.

252
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,421
The man that captured Gold Roger.

253
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,923
[Morgan] The attack came
without warning, sir.

254
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,468
The vicious Devil Fruit eater and his crew
stormed the base,

255
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,053
killing innocent Marines.

256
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,181
Turns out they had help
from a network of traitors.

257
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,642
-That's not what happened.
-Sh! No talking.

258
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:59,064
They would've overrun the base. Once
they saw my axe, they ran off in fear.

259
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:03,736
Was that before or after you let them
steal a map to the Grand Line?

260
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,487
[Morgan] That was regrettable.

261
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:10,701
I had to make a decision
and opted for the welfare of my Marines.

262
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,078
It's a good thing
they had you at the helm.

263
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:20,252
What steps are you taking
to apprehend these pirates?

264
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,504
Well, we're scouring the surrounding seas.

265
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,423
Of course, they wouldn't have gotten away

266
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,760
if my useless son
had been able to prevent their escape.

267
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,971
[chuckles]
He probably would've been killed

268
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,933
if not for the bravery
of our newly-enlisted cadet.

269
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,360
-Newly enlisted?
-Just this morning. Sir.

270
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,906
Make no mistake, sir, I won't rest

271
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:54,286
until I have every one of those pirates
hanging in my yard.

272
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,793
[Nami] Give it a rest.
Those ropes are too strong, even for you.

273
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,461
I've got out of worse.

274
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:07,466
When I ran out of the tent,
I… saw a town or…

275
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,346
what was left of one
after Buggy destroyed it.

276
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,223
You mean, when you tried
to leave us for dead?

277
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,935
We were surrounded and unarmed.
You were picking a fight you couldn't win.

278
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,229
I know your type.
If there's nothing to gain, you're out.

279
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:25,234
Says the wandering bounty hunter,
trading lives for a handful of Berry.

280
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,944
-I serve a purpose.
-[Nami] Sure you do.

281
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:28,904
[Zoro grunts]

282
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:32,324
-I think I can get us out of here.
-You mean get yourself out of here.

283
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,327
That's fair, but I'm going
to need you to trust me.

284
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,788
Just like a thief to lie to my face
and ask me to believe her.

285
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,540
[Nami] You got any other options?

286
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,838
Fine. Just tell me what we're gonna do.

287
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,215
[Nami] What we've been doing.

288
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,802
-Waiting to make sure we're alone.
-[Zoro] You have a lock pick?

289
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,595
[Nami] I have four lock picks.

290
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,265
The clowns only found three.

291
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,145
[Luffy screaming]

292
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,940
Better work faster.

293
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,152
[yelling]

294
00:17:08,234 --> 00:17:10,237
[laughing]

295
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:17,368
I want you to think of this
like an artistic exercise,

296
00:17:18,494 --> 00:17:21,832
because pain leads to art.

297
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:26,377
And art reveals truth.

298
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,132
But there's only one truth
I need from this exercise.

299
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:32,551
Where

300
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,595
is

301
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,472
my…

302
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,391
map?

303
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,684
Truthfully?

304
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,813
I'm… I'm kind of hungry.

305
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,025
Don't circuses have cotton candy?

306
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,736
[chuckles]

307
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,655
[groans]

308
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,577
What could you possibly
need that map for anyway?

309
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,623
You wouldn't last five minutes
in the Grand Line.

310
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,334
I already told you.
I'm gonna be King of the Pir--

311
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,335
Boring!

312
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,463
Let's go another ten feet.

313
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,760
[audience gasps]

314
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,262
[Luffy] You can stretch me all you want.

315
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,640
I can do this all day.

316
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,559
[Buggy]
I'm not asking the right questions.

317
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,395
We need to go deeper,
get you out of your comfort zone.

318
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:32,486
What makes a boy want to grow up
to be King of the Pirates?

319
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,905
Who are you trying to impress?

320
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,116
A lost love?

321
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,034
An absent parent?

322
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,495
Or was it someone

323
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,747
that you worshiped?

324
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,748
A false idol.

325
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,211
That's it.

326
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,714
Hey, give me back my hat!

327
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,717
I used to know a pirate
that wore a hat just like this.

328
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,054
Red-Haired Shanks.

329
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:00,973
You knew Shanks?

330
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,891
Ginger? Three scars, left eye?

331
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,938
We served together on a pirate crew
when we were about your age.

332
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,108
For a time,
I even thought we were friends.

333
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,819
Until he betrayed me.

334
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:20,325
Just like all the others. [chuckles]

335
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,372
He wanted to keep <i>me </i>out of the spotlight!

336
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:30,377
He wanted to keep my star
from shining too brightly!

337
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,219
Is that what he did to you, Rubber Boy?

338
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,640
Did Shanks betray you too?

339
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,767
Don't talk about him that way.

340
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,269
[Buggy] Ah.

341
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:52,232
Now we are finally getting to the truth.

342
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,903
Stretch him until he breaks.

343
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,030
Please, don't make me do this.

344
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:01,533
I invite you

345
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:07,331
to take part
in the splendor that is my show

346
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,625
and this is how you repay me?

347
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,752
With a "no"?

348
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,754
You've destroyed our town.

349
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,757
Made us your prisoners. Isn't that enough?

350
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,718
Well, maybe you'd prefer it

351
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,181
if I threw one of your constituents
on the rack instead.

352
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,726
Hey, kid!

353
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,853

It's Buggy!

357
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,530
And you're warning me?

358
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,282
Now that's a laugh.

359
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,870
I said that's a laugh.

He's having such a great time.

Aren't you, junior?

[in child voice] Yes. The best, Buggy.

Hi.

00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,171
Well, well, well,

376
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:43,176
looks like we have
something else in common. [chuckles]

377
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,390
You ate a Devil Fruit?

378
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,725
The Chop Chop Fruit.

379
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:55,522
So you can slice me and you can dice me,

380
00:21:56,106 --> 00:22:01,737

back together again.

I've been thinking about you for years.

398
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,062
About how you killed my brother.

399
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,567
I killed a lot of pirates.

400
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,444
My name is Cabaji,

401
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:28,448
and a couple of years ago,
you hunted us across the Goa Kingdom.

402
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,159
Followed us for weeks
through the swamp lands,

403
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,453
day and night, never relenting,

404
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,955
like some kind of demon.

Still not ringing a bell.

406
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,470
You cut off his head
and you stuffed it in a bag,

00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,764
all for a few Berry.

[Koby] Yes, sir.

00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,531
Something wrong with your uniform, son?

417

No, sir.

00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,579

-Are you sure that's all it is, cadet?

The Marine insignia,
it's not for everyone, you know.

We both know you don't belong here.

424

Being a Marine, it's all I've ever wanted.

425
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,354
And I want to believe you,
but your story doesn't add up.

426
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,313
Sir…

427
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,284
How long have you been working
with the pirates who attacked this base?

428
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,203
What? No, sir. I'm not.

429
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,247
[Bogard] You were seen with one of them

430
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,749
at the local tavern.

431
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,001
[Garp] Time to start telling the truth,
cadet.

432
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,589
[laughing] Or we'll have you hanging
on one of those crosses out in the yard.

433
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,849
I was held captive
by a pirate named Alvida.

434
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,810
I was her prisoner.

435
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,020
It was horrible.

436
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,609
-Then he saved me.
-Who?

438
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:12,696
Luffy.

439
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,156
The Straw Hat Pirate?

440
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,159
You say his name is…

441
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,496
is Luffy?

442
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,582
Yes, sir.

443
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,886
[Garp] What's your part in all this?

444
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:43,184
-Why are you pretending to be a Marine?
-I'm not pretending.

445
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,437
Being a Marine is my dream.

446
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:51,067
Marines make the world a better place.
One where people can feel safe.

447
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,361
That's what I told Luffy.

448
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,531
-And he set me free.
-Did he now?

449
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,619
Why didn't you tell anyone about this?

450
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,871
I was worried they wouldn't let me enlist.

Telling the truth

453
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,518
is a core value of the Marines.

454
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,481
-Isn't that right, Bogard?
-Yes, sir.

455
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:35,153

at this particular base.

He's a pirate.

461
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,175
Pirates should face justice.

462
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,220
Good.

463
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,975
Then we'll find him together.

I know you're upset,
but you should eat something.

[Luffy] I'm not hungry.

470
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,833
You're never not hungry. What's going on?

471
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:33,503
[man] I thought this shithole
was supposed to be popular.

472
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,338
We never got our drinks.

473
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,592
We are still very, very thirsty.

474
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,052

be ready to back it up like a man.

-[Makino] Please stop. He's just a boy.

respect for his betters.

to teach him that for months.

Put him down.

You're lucky I don't slit his throat.

489
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,303
You can spill a drink on me
and I'll let it slide.

All those wonderful powers

509
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,553
Of course, you could always give me my map

alone in this tank.

You mean the ones that abandoned you?

514
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,065
Just like Shanks did.

515
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,861
Oh, did that make you sad?

516
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,322
They will come back for me.

No one's coming for you.

518
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:54,287
Your only chance is to turn over that map,
and if you do,

519
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:59,834
I may have a very special place on my crew

520
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,045

and you can serve the man

who will become the King of the Pirates.

533
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,084

00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,504
Even greater than your crew.

715
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,967
I'm gonna find the One Piece
and become King of the Pirates!

716
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,053
Greater than even us, huh?

717
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,687
Well, in that case…

718
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:05,906
This hat is the most precious thing I own.
It means the world to me.

719
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,369
And I want you to take it.

720
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,588
When we meet again,
you can give it back to me.

721
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:25,008
But only after you become a great pirate.

722
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,511
That'll be our promise.

723
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,185
Be good, Luffy.

[Nami] Almost finished.

726
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,104
You fixed it.

727
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:24,568
Thanks.

728
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,653
Well, you said
it was your treasure, right?

729
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,790
Is every day gonna be this crazy with you?

730
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,594
Shanks always said…

731
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:55,432
that if the path to what you want
seems too easy…

732
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,186
then you're on the wrong path.

733
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,524
This Shanks guy sounds all right.

Next stop,

736
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:17,621
the Grand Line!

739
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:53,657
It's me.

740
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,078
You can tell him I have the map.

181
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,432
I even have to paint her toenails.

-So why don't you just leave?
-No one leaves Alvida!

183
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,229
She'll never let me go.

184
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,399
You should never let anyone
tell you what you can't do.

185
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,901
If I did that,

186

I never would've left my village
to go find the One Piece.

188
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:44,036
That's impossible.
Every pirate in the world is after that.

189

Why shouldn't I be the one to find it?

There are a-hundred-foot waves
and sea beasts that'll crush your bones.

Once you enter the Grand Line,
you never return.

If you want to get out of here,
it's now or never.

-Alvida, I can explain.

You dare betray me to a bounty hunter?

-Shut up.
-[Alvida] No. No, he's not.

He's mine, and he'll always be mine.

That's not what he told me.

My favorite is Number 1.

To turn down Baroque Works

280
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:28,797
is to forfeit your life.

Scars don't make the man, Luffy.

Don't you?

714
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,732
So why did you decide to become a thief?

715
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:23,238
I didn't decide. I needed to eat.
You do what you have to, to survive.

716
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:27,618
You're right.
Nothing more important than food.

717
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,453
[Nami] Just find the map.

[Marine] Pirates, sir, inside the base.
We're under attack!

722
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,439
What pirates?

723
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:01,819
A woman with orange hair,
dressed like a Marine.

724
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,238
She was trying
to steal a map to The Grand Line.

Do you think they know we're here?

730
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:20,295
No, I think they're after the other thief
and idiot pirate trying to steal a map.

731
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,422
What are the odds of that?

Hate to break up this beautiful moment,
but we need to get this safe out of here.

Maybe if we find some rope or something.

00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,321
Or we can do that.

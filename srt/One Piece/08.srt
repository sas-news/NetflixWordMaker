that knows how to use swords.

541
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,270
I want to get stronger too.

542
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:53,813
Like my friend.

543
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,524
Or whatever.

544
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,363
Maybe the old chef was right.

545
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,366
It <i>is </i>your turn.

546
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,370
Your training begins tomorrow.

547
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,330
Dismissed.

548
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:28,306
This is an unusual place
for a man of your stature.

549
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,269
Come on, lads.

550
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,439
We're in the presence
of a mighty Warlord of the Sea.

551
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:40,151
Show a little… [grunts] …respect.

552
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,573
Afraid I'm not in the mood
for a duel today, Hawk Eyes.

553
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,201
-I'm a wee bit hungover.
-I'm not here to fight.

554
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,079
Not when you're half the man
you used to be.

555
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,332
I could still take you.

556
00:38:55,708 --> 00:39:00,046
-And with one arm tied behind my back.
-[laughing]

557
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:06,052
I recently ran into someone
who might be of interest to you.

558
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,888
A boy you mentioned long ago.

559
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:16,479
Luffy!

560
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,522
[chuckles]

561
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,690
He really did it.

562
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:23,402
No way. It's Luffy. He's a pirate!

563
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,445
He's a captain!

564
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,030
[all laugh]

565
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,573
I guess we better watch our backs.

566
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:28,657
[all laugh]

567
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,785
Bring out the reserve booze, boys!

568
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,328
I thought you were hungover.

569
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,412
[Shanks] Oh, lighten up,

570
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,998
you somber old son of a gun.
Drink with us.

571
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,626
I suppose a drink wouldn't hurt.

572
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,088
-This is cause to celebrate!
-[pirates] Yeah!

573
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,049
[Luffy] <i>So what do you think?</i>

574
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,682
It's a little piece of home
to take with you on our journey.

575
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,227
And I can whip up tangerine tarts
anytime you want.

576
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,312
[emotional music plays]

577
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:11,700
It's perfect.

578
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,167
We actually have something for you too.

579
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,295
Usopp, set the main!

580
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,756
[Usopp] Setting the main.

581
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,927
[adventurous music plays]

582
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,080
Whoo-hoo!

583
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:58,998
Whoa!

584
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,875
[Nami and Sanji chuckle]

585
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,502
Whoo!

586
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,046
Yeah! Hoo-hoo!

587
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,008
Wha!

588
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,092
Yah!

589
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,179
The entrance to the Grand Line
isn't too far off,

590
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:16,640
but I think there's a mistake on the map.

591
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,892
[Luffy] What do you mean?

592
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:22,521
[Nami] Well, it looks like a river
or a canal or something,

593
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,356
but it doesn't make any sense.

594
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,442
These elevations show a mountain.

595
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,402
I mean, how can a river go up a mountain?

596
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,863
You're our navigator.

597
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,990
You'll figure it out.

598
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,033
[Sanji] Hey, Luffy!

599
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,703
Come here. I've got an idea.

600
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,216

[grunts]

603
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,526
I'm gonna find the All Blue.

604
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,781
Ah!

605
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,325
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates.

606
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,332
I'm gonna be
the world's greatest swordsman.

607
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,463
I'm gonna draw a map of the world.

608
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:33,968
I…

609
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,687
am gonna become
a brave warrior of the sea!

611
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,109
This is it, crew.

612
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,530
The Grand Line.

613
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,868
Nothing's gonna stand in our way!

614
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,829
Yeah!

615
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,789
Whoo!

616
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,291
Whoo!

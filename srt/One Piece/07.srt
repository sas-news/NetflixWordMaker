[Garp] We're not here for you, Red Leg.

178
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,631
We need some information about
a young pirate who was here recently.

179
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,966
Name of Luffy.

180
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,053
-I can't help you.
-Can't? Or won't?

181
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,639
These days, I'm lucky
if I remember my regulars.

182
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,225
Oh, you'll remember this one. Straw hat.

183
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,061
Always running his big mouth.

184
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,772
No, I'm drawing a blank.

185
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,651
But how about a meal on the house?

186
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,363
I got a dozen T-bone steaks
and a busted cooler.

187
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:05,659
It'd be such a shame to let
all that delicious marbling go to waste.

188
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,620
We're not here for a meal. We're here--

189
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,704
That steak…

190
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,915
Medium rare?

191
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,585
More rare than medium.

192
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,422
[mysterious music plays]

193
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,905
Never seen that before.

194
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,241
What could have done this?

195
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,454
Maybe I should head back,
make sure the Merry's secure.

196
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,457
Arlong did this.

197
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:58,170
[Buggy] Hey, shit-hat! I think we
can all agree that Arlong's a bad fish.

198
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,422
But why don't we quit lollygagging
and get my body back?

199
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,007
Pipe down in there.

200
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,009
[Buggy] Or what?
You gonna whip me up a soufflé?

201
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,429
-How about you take him for a while?
-Ooh, new guy carries the clown head.

202
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,313
Everyone! Please!

203
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,315
[overlapping chatter]

204
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,150
[man] Please, everyone.

205
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,697
We don't have much time,
and we're short again this month.

206
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,077
[man 2] Is it enough?

207
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,707
-Do we have time to get some more?
-[Nami] No.

208
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,626
You don't.

209
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,420
[woman] It's Nami.

210
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,171
[indistinct whispering]

211
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,396
You've got a lot of nerve
showing your face here.

212
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,706
Got something for me?

213
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,291
You got something for me?

214
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,390
I'm sorry I took the map book.

215
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,561
-And you promise to never steal again?
-I promise.

216
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,233
-Your fingers crossed behind your back?
-Maybe.

217
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,405
You're not a bad kid, Nami.

218
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,783
You just did a bad thing.

219
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,495
Next time, come to me first.

220
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,207
Maybe we can have you
do some odd jobs around town.

221
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,251
-Thank you, Mr. Genzo.
-[woman] You did the right thing.

222
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,797
[woman 2] Help! Ah! Help! Everyone!

223
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,174
Pirates! They're attacking the village!

224
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,760
-What's going on?
-[woman 2] Help! Everyone, pirates!

225
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,887
-There's pirates!
-[indistinct chatter]

226
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,101
Citizens of Coco Village!

227
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,522
This town belongs to me!

228
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,109
[yells]

229
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:35,661
Run!

230
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,457
[grunting]

231
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,091
[screams]

232
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,389
[gasps]

233
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,154
You're short.

234
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,406
Nami, please. This is all we have.

235
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:17,661
-Arlong has bled us dry.
-Then find more blood.

236
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,048
Luffy?

237
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,968
-What are you doing here?
-I could ask you the same thing.

238
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,637
-This is where I belong.
-[Luffy] I don't believe that.

239
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:39,767
-This is not you.
-No. This isn't the me you want me to be.

240
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:41,852
Nami…

241
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,355
if you need our help--

242
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,442
No, I don't need any of you.

243
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:54,323
Arlong wanted the map,
and I conned you into getting it for me.

244
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,533
And you bought it.

245
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:01,497
I was never part of your stupid crew.

246
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,292
You don't mean that.

247
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,421
Take the rest of these clowns
and sail away from here.

248
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,299
I never want to see you again.

249
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,183
[sighs]

250
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,521
[chuckles]

251
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:30,067
Okay, that went about as bad as it could.

252
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,654
So back to the boat
before the fishmen find us?

253
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:37,116
-Sail the hell out of here? Okay.
-There's something else going on here.

254
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,159
She was very clear she wants us to leave.

255
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,328
You don't know women.
They never say what they mean.

256
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:45,124
-Tell me again why the cook gets a say.
-Don't you guys get it? She's one of them.

257
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:49,586
She's a bad guy.
The villagers are terrified of her.

258
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,755
Not all of them.

259
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,343
Hey!

260
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,345
Scar guy.

261
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,892
Who was that lady?

262
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:05,769
You know,

263
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,021
the one with the cool hair?

264
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,231
Who wants to know?

265
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,775
I'm Monkey D. Luffy.

266
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,278
-I'm a pirate--
-Hunter.

267
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:16,947
Pirate hunter.

268
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,451
-We're here to collect Arlong's bounty.
-[Genzo] You?

269
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,621
I've seen men twice your size

270
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,249
and with twice your number
go into Arlong Park.

271
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,168
None of them ever came back.

272
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,045
-We just want to talk to her.
-[Genzo] Trust me, you don't.

273
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,256
But if it'll get you out of my town,

274
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:39,720
try the house down that road,
on the edge of the tangerine grove.

275
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,892
[adventurous music plays]

276
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:53,066
[Usopp] I think I got more of a boat body
than a long-journey-on-foot kind of body.

277
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,195
Anybody else missing the ocean?

278
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,905
No? Okay.

279
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:03,368
I could go bring the boat around
if we don't want to walk all the way back.

280
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,302
-Whoa!
-Turn around and leave. Now.

281
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,762
That's what I've been saying.

282
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,305
Hey, I saw you earlier.

283
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,849
I think maybe you and I have
something in common.

284
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,146
I've got the gun,
and you're standing in front of it.

285
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,358
-What could we possibly have in common?
-Let's start with Nami.

286
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,779
-Seems you know her very well.
-She's a thief with no conscience.

287
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,574
And when there's no more left to take,
she leaves and doesn't turn back.

288
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:46,286
-Now get off my property.
-Nami's part of our crew.

289
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,622
She's our friend.

290
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,834
My sister doesn't have any friends.

291
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:57,547
-The sooner you realize that, the better.
-Sisters. That makes sense.

292
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,759
-Both as beautiful as each other.
-Give it up.

293
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,553
I can tell
she really did a number on you guys.

294
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,223
You're not special,

295
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,267
and I can't help you.

296
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,852
-How about a meal?
-What?

297
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,773
An exchange of sorts
for your valuable time and information.

298
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,942
-You cook?
-He's a waiter.

299
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,277
Best cook in the East Blue.

300
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,571
You never tasted anything better
in your life. Usopp's word!

301
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,908
Ain't got much to cook with.

302
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,661
You'd be surprised how much I can make
with very few ingredients.

303
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,162
What do you say?

304
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,166
We have a little dinner,
a little conversation.

305
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,295
Fine.

306
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,673
But there'd better be dessert.

307
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,101
Mmm.

308
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,397
Mmm.

309
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,403
This is nothing.
You should see him at a curry house.

310
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,159
A fair bit better
than Marine rations, huh?

311
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:13,290
I didn't know you had the pleasure
of dining on a Marine vessel.

312
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,416
Only in the brig.

313
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,053
Where is he, Zeff? I know Luffy was here.

314
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,764
This is a rare vintage from Micqueot.

315
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,227
I've been saving it for something special.

316
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,855
It's been a while since I've run into
anyone from the old days,

317
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,900
even if we did find ourselves
on opposite sides of a cannon.

318
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,444
Finally got yourself
on the right side of the law.

319
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,657
The law had nothing to do with it.
It was time to stop.

320
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,743
I took my choice.

321
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,038
There's a new generation,
and they're coming up.

322
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,082
It's their time now.

323
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,125
[chuckles] Like hell it is.

324
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,586
Bunch of impulsive children.

325
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:06,093
Perfectly aged and ready to be enjoyed.

326
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,886
You leave it too long,

327
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,555
it'll go bad.

328
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,233
Or you could just serve whiskey.

329
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,986
[chuckles]

330
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,781
[dance music plays]

331
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,661
[overlapping chatter]

332
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,266
[cheering]

333
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,770
Yeah!

334
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,938
Come on!

335
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,489
[Arlong laughs]

336
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,118
Arlong, we need to talk
about Coco Village.

337
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:17,164
We can talk tomorrow.
Coco Village will still be there,

338
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,333
provided they paid the tribute in full.

339
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,879
That's what we need to talk about.
That and the terms of our deal.

340
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,964
Always so serious, Nami.

341
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,342
Have a drink. Relax.

342
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,385
[explosion]

343
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,472
[dance music stops]

344
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,725
[military music plays]

345
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,566
Captain Nezumi. What a pleasant surprise.

346
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,610
Always good to catch up, Arlong.

347
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,238
Although, I hear troubling news from Gosa.

348
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,825
Seems they've recently
been raided by pirates.

349
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,327
So terrible.

350
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,496
There are other reports as well

351
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,042
about fishmen stirring things up
around the Conomi Islands.

352
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,305
I have additional concerns.

353
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:17,933
How many?

354
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,312
-About twice as many as that.
-That's double our usual arrangement.

355
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,939
[Nezumi] Times are changing.

356
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,691
It's getting harder than ever
to cover up your tracks.

357
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,109
[chuckles]

358
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,611
Nami.

359
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,367
This is a party.

360
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,995
Let's go upstairs to discuss our business.

361
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,167
Nami, join us.

362
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,547
[Sanji] Dinner's served.

363
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,593
Mmm.

364
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,849
Told you.

365
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,986
You know, this is the best thing
I've eaten in my entire life.

366
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,073
Listen. There's plenty more
where that came from, but…

367
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,244
first, we really need to know about Nami.

368
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,832
[suspenseful music plays]

369
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,417
The truth is…

370
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,547
-What's going on?
-[woman] Get in. Get in. Close the door.

371
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,464
[Nami] Mom!

372
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,341
Get in.

373
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,302
-[Nami] Mom, please.
-Stay put.

374
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,178
And no matter what you hear,
do not come out.

375
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,096
[Nami] Mom!

376
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,189
Who's there?

377
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,567
-[gunshots]
-[villagers screaming]

378
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,901
[footsteps approaching]

379
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,490
-[gunshot]
-[gasps]

380
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,621
Is that any way to treat a guest?

381
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:11,296
Tribute is 100,000 Berry per adult.

382
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,131
Go fetch it.

383
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,310
Take it. It's all I got.

384
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,062
[Arlong clicks tongue]

385
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,655
Good.

386
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,618
[laughs]

387
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,797
Three plates on the table.

388
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,964
How many people live here?

389
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,092
Only one.

390
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,220
No record of any family.

391
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,805
[clicking tongue]

392
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,688
How many people live here?

393
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,856
How many?

394
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:22,951
-I have two daughters.
-[Arlong] You'll have to pay for them.

395
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,371
-Fifty thousand Berry each.
-I gave you everything I have.

396
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,331
Too bad for you. It ain't enough.

397
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:30,667
Don't you hurt her!

398
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,547
-Mom.
-[Arlong] Oh, it's a family reunion.

399
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,216
The little humans, so precious.

400
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,760
Precious.

401
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,722
[Nami crying]

402
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:53,773
The money, will you take it as tribute
for my daughters?

403
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,066
No, Mom, you can't!

404
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,527
You understand what you're saying?

405
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,071
-I do.
-[Nami] No, Mom!

406
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:04,117
Why didn't you just lie?
You didn't have to tell him about us.

407
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,660
Because you are my daughters,

408
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,288
and I would never deny that.

409
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,249
[crying]

410
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,918
You deserve to live full and happy lives.

411
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,755
I'm sorry I couldn't do more for you.

412
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,884
Buy you nice things
or cook you nice meals.

413
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,597
I'm sorry I wasn't a very good mother.

414
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,974
[Nami] No. No, don't say that.

415
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,776
Mom, no. [sobbing]

416
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,737
Mom, no! No! No! No!

417
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,533
[woman] Nami, Nojiko,

418
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,494
I love you, girls.

419
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,871
-[gunshot]
-[gasps]

420
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,878
[Nami crying]

421
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,427
[Sanji sniffles]

422
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,386
[coughs]

423
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,099
Wait. Nami's working for the pirate
that killed your mother?

424
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,294
[Luffy] She was just a kid.

425
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,387
She's not anymore.

426
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,057
She made her choice.

427
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,813
I'm tired of hearing about Nami
from other people.

428
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,607
She told you to leave, Luffy.

429
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,402
So did you.

430
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:51,242
How do you know
she's not one of Arlong's crew?

431
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:55,288
Same way I knew you weren't gonna kill me
when I cut you down from that cross.

432
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,790
Same way I knew about Usopp

433
00:31:58,958 --> 00:31:59,876
and Sanji.

434
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,086
Yeah, I don't know about that waiter.

435
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,797
I know Nami's good.

436
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,676
She needs to know it too.

437
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:18,853
[dog barking]

438
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,361
[Arlong] Tell me, Captain.
What's a fair price for your discretion?

439
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,197
Ten thousand Berry?

440
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,240
Twenty thousand?

441
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,369
I thought we had a fair deal.

442
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,039
[Nezumi] It's not easy
keeping Marine patrols out of the area.

443
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,625
And with your increase in activity,

444
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:45,797
it'd be a shame if word of this
got back to Marine headquarters.

445
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:47,632
[Arlong] Hmm.

446
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,973
I guess it's just the price
of doing business.

447
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,977
You're a lot smarter than people
give you credit for.

448
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,773
Because I'm a fishman?

449
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,275
That's not what I--

450
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,611
Does it surprise you
that I have intelligence?

451
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:10,738
Ambition?

452
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,743
Usage beyond manual labor for humans?

453
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:20,415
Not at all. I've personally
never felt any ill will toward your kind.

454
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:25,503
And yet the leaders of the organization
you so proudly represent

455
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,714
saw fit to disparage

456
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,633
and enslave my people.

457
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,511
-Slavery has been abolished.
-But your prejudice remains.

458
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,389
Fishmen have all the same rights
as humans.

459
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:37,306
Do we?

460
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,480
The World Government has worked very hard

461
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:49,027
to foster better relations
between our people to keep the peace.

462
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,071
A fishman
is one of the Warlords of the Sea.

463
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,823
Jimbei is a fool!

464
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:57,160
A government dog to an inferior master.

465
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,538
I serve no man.

466
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,209
Perhaps I was a bit hasty.

467
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,088
I can accept the terms of our usual deal.

468
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:12,675
[clicks tongue]

469
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:20,266
Yes.

470
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,228
You're smarter than people
give you credit for.

471
00:34:34,237 --> 00:34:36,616
-[Nami] And what about our deal, Arlong?
-What about it?

472
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,699
I have the money.

473
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,663
A hundred million Berry?

474
00:34:44,998 --> 00:34:48,795
Nami… have you been holding out on me?

475
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,422
I stole that money fair and square.
Now are you ready to honor our agreement?

476
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,014
Bring the money to me by sunrise,

477
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,726
and I will consider the matter closed.

478
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,103
[grunts]

479
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,072
-Kuroobi.
-Mmm.

480
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,324
Bring Nezumi back in here.

481
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,576
-Go.
-[Kuroobi] Aye.

482
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:28,459
Maybe there's a way for the rat
to earn some extra Berry after all.

483
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,295
[chuckles]

484
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,302
-Two Mistral Shooters, good man.
-[bartender] Coming right up.

485
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,806
-What are you doing?
-Buying you a drink.

486
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,351
-You're welcome.
-We can't. We're on duty.

487
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,186
Oh, come on.

488
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,153
Might as well enjoy this wild goose chase.

489
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,241
Not much of a drinker, are you?

490
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:07,039
I still don't know why Garp has such
a bug up his arse about this Straw Hat.

491
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:15,381
-Two more.
-Aren't you full of surprises?

492
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,893
Is this really
what we're supposed to be doing?

493
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,227
What are you talking about?

494
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,730
Maybe the Straw Hat Pirates
aren't the villains

495
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,398
the Marines are making them out to be.

496
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,569
Thought it'd take a lot more liquor
to bring out your mutinous side.

497
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,072
It just seems like
if we keep making the same mistakes,

498
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,782
nothing's ever gonna change.

499
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,454
All right, out with it.

500
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,082
You know something.

501
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,422
Garp is Luffy's grandfather.

502
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:04,889
Of all the things I thought you were going
to say, that wasn't even on the list.

503
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,433
I should've known
from the way they both love meat.

504
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,770
You can't tell anyone.

505
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,188
It makes sense.

506
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:18,486
Why else would a vice-admiral be going
after some rubber kid playing pirate?

507
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,154
He's not playing.

508
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,490
Say what you want about Luffy,
but he's the real deal.

509
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,076
It doesn't matter. Not to a man like Garp.

510
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,121
You color outside the lines,
you get your arm chopped off.

511
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,251
-What?
-Seems like you can relate.

512
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,837
Must've been hard growing up
with a dad like--

513
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,924
I am nothing like that Straw Hat!

514
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,095
Fellow with a straw hat
came through here the other day.

515
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,222
Do you know where he was heading?

516
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,558
I might.

517
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,811
What's it worth to you?

518
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:55,106
And then the creature turns towards me,

519
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,400
flaring its tusks.

520
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,986
The last of the wild boars of Jaya.

521
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,988
[chuckles]

522
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,155
Two days.

523
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,616
Two days, I wrestled that crazed hog

524
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,827
until finally I prevailed.

525
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,789
And I cooked it over an open flame,

526
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,042
and I ate it with my bare hands.

527
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,170
Just fire and flesh.

528
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,882
-And how did it taste?
-[Zeff] Oh.

529
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,342
[sniffs]

530
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,012
That meat, whoa.

531
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:29,390
It was so tender,
it near melted off the bone.

532
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,892
It was the best meal I've ever had.

533
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,315
The longer they elude you,
the more satisfying the catch.

534
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,236
You know,

535
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:47,241
you're not tricking me
with your delicious stories.

536
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,285
I'm not hunting a boar.

537
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:55,374
The last thing I want to do is… put myself
in the middle of a family dispute.

538
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,129
The kid's special.

539
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,342
Reminds me of another pirate we knew
back in our glory days.

540
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,301
Don't say it.

541
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,053
It's not gonna make it less true.

542
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,098
The kid reminds me of Gold Roger.

543
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,189
And look what happened to him.

544
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,149
Executed.

545
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,318
Skewered by Marine polearms.

546
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,696
I don't want my…

547
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,870
I don't want the boy
to suffer the same fate.

548
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:35,623
He stood up for Baratie
when we were attacked.

549
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,209
I might be out of the game,
but I still live by the code.

550
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,126
[Koby] Sir?

551
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,507
[whispering indistinctly]

552
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,639
Thank you for the meal.

553
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,480
Have the navigator
set a course immediately

554
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,440
for the Conomi Islands.

555
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,025
-[Bogard] Aye, sir.
-Garp.

556
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,740
You have to know
when it's time to let them go.

557
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,326
Change is coming
whether you want it or not.

558
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,829
It's their turn now.

559
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,498
[Garp] Hmm.

560
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,834
We'll see about that.

561
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,921
[adventurous music plays]

562
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:36,183
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,

563
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,268
boom!

564
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,853
[laughs]

565
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,607
Yeah, I'm gonna go get some air.

566
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,777
Can you just be quiet?

567
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:50,489
Aw, come on. Where's the fun in that?

568
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:55,411
Do you really think your little toys
can get through the skin of a fishman?

569
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,748
-These are smoke bombs.
-[Buggy] Smoke?

570
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:01,959
That's rich. [chuckles]

571
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:06,505
Makes me think of how long it's been
since I've had any smoked fish.

572
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,385
Maybe if you guys had some extra?

573
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:12,970
Please?

574
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,766
Ah, screw you guys!

575
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,728
Arlong's gonna bite
the shit out of you anyway.

576
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,272
You know you don't stand a chance
against him and his army.

577
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:26,025
And you dumb pieces of garbage,

578
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,986
you ain't gonna do anything
against that stupid--

579
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,071
[grunts]

580
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,241

[grunts]

585
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,702
[Nojiko] How dare you?

586
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,957
It's not enough that you're working
for our mother's killer,

587
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,417
but now you're desecrating her grave too?

588
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,920
-Nojiko. Nojiko, wait!
-[screams]

589

[panting]

590
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,675
It's not what you think.

591
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,927
You have no idea what I think.

592
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,136
Ah!

593
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:41,809
What's this?

594
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,272
Is this the money that you stole?

595
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,775
And you're hiding it
next to our mother's body?

596
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,447
-Nami, what kind of monster are you?
-You don't understand.

597
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,991
Then make me understand.

598
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,339
I need to speak with you.

599
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:17,886
-And who are you?
-My name is Nami. You killed my mother.

600
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:18,929
Nami.

601
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,475
Oh, right, I did. The ex-Marine.

602
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,520
She was brave. I'll give her that.

603
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,356
Let me guess.
You've come to even the score.

604
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,820
You want to kill me, little girl?

605
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,281
No.

606
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,533
I want to join your crew.

607
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,037
[laughs]

608
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,792
That is rich.

609
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,796
But why would I ever let a human
onto my crew?

610
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,882
Because I have something you want.

611
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,557
[Arlong] You drew this?

612
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,186
This is good.

613
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:09,438
Very good.

614
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:14,526
Maybe the best I've seen in the East Blue,
fishman or human.

615
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,488
So let me join your crew,
and I'll help you.

616
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,572
[Arlong] Help me?

617
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,498
I killed your mother,

618
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:32,670
and now you want to come work for me?

619
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,090
Hmm.

620
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,300
Why would you do that?

621
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,178
Because you have something I want.

622
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,600
[Nami] <i>I told Arlong</i>
<i>I'd work for him on one condition.</i>

623
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,311
That he let me buy back Coco Village.

624
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,231
And he said he would

625
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,317
for a hundred million Berry.

626
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,444
A hundred million?

627
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,865
-That would take a lifetime.
-I have the money.

628
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,535
All of it.

629
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:09,123
And now I can buy the freedom
of the village and everyone in it.

630
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,173
So…

631
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,136
this whole time,

632
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,763
you were trying to help.

633
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,101
Why didn't you tell me?

634
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:37,818
-Nami, I'm your sister. Why didn't you--
-I couldn't lose you too.

635
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,820
Or anyone else.

636
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,536
[sighs]

637
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:50,414
So you kept that secret all these years.

638
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,376
And you let me hate you.

639
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:00,966
I hated you.

640
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,431
[footsteps approaching]

641
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,979
[Nezumi] A shame to break up
this touching scene.

642
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:18,984
I've heard that pirates
are stashing their plunder in this area.

643
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,487
You two wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

644
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,949
That's obviously been stolen.

645
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,661
By the authority of the Marines
and the World Government,

646
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,330
I'm going to have to confiscate it.

647
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:35,042
-No, you can't do that. It's mine!
-A hundred million Berry?

648
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,711
And where would <i>you </i>get that much money?

649
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:40,923
How did you know it was a hundred…

650
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,886
Arlong put you up to this, didn't he?

651
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,974
I… I don't know what you mean.

652
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,270
-No!
-[Nezumi] Watch yourself.

653
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,189
Or we will take you into custody as well.

You can't do this.

Wait. Nami, stop! Wait. Wait!

-Nami.
-Let me go! Let me go! They can't do this!

-There's nothing you can do!
-Arlong will kill the entire village!

We all know the truth of this world.

670

Fishmen are
the rightful rulers of the seas.

671
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,965
And the humans know it too.

672
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:10,429
They fear our power,
so they bound us with chains.

673
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:15,350
They loathe our presence,
so they banned us from their cities.

674

[grunts]

675
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:19,521
But we broke those chains, huh?

676
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,691
Built our own cities.

677
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:28,572
Now the time has come to restore
the natural order of this world.

678

For centuries, humans have used us,

00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,668
kept us down.

684
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,505
And our so-called leaders,
they allowed it.

685
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:50,886
Banners of unity and peace
they so lovingly wave

686
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:55,599
are, in truth,
flags of surrender, willing defeat.

687
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:00,979
I don't know about you,
but I ain't surrendering.

[panting]

691
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:10,489
We are the embodiment
of fishman superiority!

692
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:14,409
And with the Grand Line map,
we will reclaim our birthright.

693
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:17,913
Our righteous rage
will burn through Coco Village

to the ends of the East Blue,

695

and as we move
to the Grand Line and beyond,

696
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:27,756
we will teach each and every human
their rightful place,

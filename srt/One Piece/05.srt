one more prime rib medium-well,

181
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:50,107
I am going to drop dead of boredom,
you old shitbag!

182
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,652
-It's what we serve.
-It's an insult to the meat.

183
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,278
You don't like cooking our menu? Fine.

184
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,198
'Cause I'll be more than delighted
to give you other work elsewhere.

185
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,659
In fact, you are off the line.

186
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:03,204
Now get out there and wait tables. Move!

187
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,502
[man] I am saying, this here is my table.

188
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,046
Close to the kitchen
so I can smell the beef.

189
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:16,509
Maybe you ought to try a table outside.
Right now, the only thing I smell is you.

190
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,804
-[man yells]
-[chef] Now, now, gentlemen.

191
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,057
You know the rules here.
We don't waste food,

192
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,101
and there is no fighting at Baratie.

193
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,018
No.

194
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,605
This ain't gonna be a fight.
I'm just going to kill him.

195
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,606
Like to see you try.

196
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,818
I'd like to pour you each a glass
of Ithürzburger Stein. On the house.

197
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,237
Okay, I'll have that drink.

198
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,032
-After he apologizes for his bad manners.
-Over my dead body.

199
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,618

200
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,708
[grunts]

201
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,293
Good fighter.

202
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:59,135
No cause for alarm, folks.
Please enjoy your meals.

203
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,680
Hi, welcome to our shitty restaurant

204
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:05,307
where the only thing
worse than the ambience is the food.

205
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,268
My name is Sanji. What can I get for you?

206
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,478
-One of everything, please.
-[Sanji] Any drinks?

207
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,356
One of our signature cocktails
to help you choke down your meal?

208
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,941
Giving us the hard sell, huh?

209
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,738
Apologies, madam, I didn't see you there.
Would you care for an apéritif to start?

210
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,948
We have several
rare Micqueot vintages in stock.

211
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,950
Or perhaps you'd like a glass of Umeshu?

212
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,245
You know, something sweet
for someone sweet.

213
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,665
-Something wrong with your eye?
-Just blinded by your beauty.

214
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,626
[clears throat] Waiter, can I get a beer
and something for my friends?

215
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,671
-Two beers. I usually have three, but--
-And a milk.

216
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,049
Three beers and a milk.
And, uh, for madam?

217
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,092
Water.

218
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,345
Still, sparkling, mineral?
With ice or without? Cubed or crushed?

219
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,849
Regular water in a regular glass. Thanks.

220
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,142
Right away.

221
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,728
Ah!

222
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,565
-What?
-Nothing.

223
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,360
Madam. Forgive my rude behavior, madam.

224
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,030
Would madam prefer her water
in a crystal glass,

225
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,783
or would a golden bowl
be more madam's style?

226
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,202
Nami's got a boyfriend.

227
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,453
[all chuckling]

228
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,541
You guys are the worst.

229
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,338
[Marines yelling indistinctly]

230
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,388
Damage report?

231
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,808
We're making progress, sir,
but the ship needs repairs.

232
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,768
We've got to shore up the yard,
reinforce the--

233
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,978
-How long till we sail?
-At least a day. Maybe two.

234
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,065
Sir, the 77th Marine Branch
is running training exercises nearby.

235
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,942
-They could be here in a few hours.
-No.

236
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,654
We don't need their help.

237
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,240
If we delay,
we might lose track of Luffy entirely.

238
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,407
[Garp] No SOS calls.

239
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,036
We'll handle this problem on our own.

240
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,122
[suspenseful music plays]

241
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:01,841
Hello.

242
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,926
-[man screams over radio]
-[sword clangs]

243
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,929
Mihawk, did I catch you
in the middle of something?

244
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,722
[pasodoble music plays]

245
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:09,807
[cannon firing]

246
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,894
Just killing some time.

247
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,479
[man screams]

248
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,731
[men grunt]

249
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,569
What can I do for you, Vice-Admiral?

250
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:26,031
I've a request for you.
One that suits your particular talents.

251
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,283
Who's the quarry?

252
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,660
[yelling]

253
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,622
A young upstart named Luffy.

254
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,875
Fancies himself a pirate.

255
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,418
[men scream]

256
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,503
[pasodoble music continues]

257
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,631
Doesn't sound like much of a challenge.

258
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,929
[Garp] <i>Oh no, no, no.</i>
<i>Don't underestimate this one.</i>

259
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,472
He's a wild card.

260
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,433
One moment.

261
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,184
[cannons firing]

262
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,441
[men clamoring]

263
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,239
[man] That's enough!

264
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,743
[suspenseful music plays]

265
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,204
I'm afraid it's time I ended this.

266
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,668
[grunts]

267
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:25,341
You've killed my men, destroyed my fleet.

268
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:27,968
Why are you after me?

269
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,846
You woke me from my nap.

270
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,891
[grunts]
Then allow me to make it permanent!

271
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,609
[men grunt]

272
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,027
[grunts]

273
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,742
Such a disappointing final gambit.

274
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,246
[chuckles]

275
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,957
[Krieg screams]

276
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,126
[gurgling]

277
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,879
[Mihawk] <i>Apologies, Vice-Admiral.</i>

278
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,967
You've piqued my interest.
Where am I headed?

279
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,136
East Blue. Sambas region.

280
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,347
And, Mihawk,

281
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,810
bring him alive by any means necessary.

282
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,065
I can't eat another bite.

283
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,984
But it's so good.

284
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,362
-Oh man, you said it.
-I'm not gonna be hungry for a week.

285
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,948
-Should we order dessert?
-I already got mine.

286
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:31,865
Mmm.

287
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,869
That reminds me. We should do a toast.
Come on. Grab your glasses.

288
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:42,209
To the best crew sailing on the sea
and to our victory! Yeah!

289
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,711
-[chuckles]
-[Nami] No, I'm sorry.

290
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,337
What victory exactly?

291
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,133
Against the Marines.
Our very first battle and we crushed them.

292
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,969
I don't know how many naval battles
you guys have been part of--

293
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,972
-Two dozen, at least.
-But that was a disaster.

294
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,724
We were unprepared, uncoordinated.

295
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,184
By all rights,
we should be at the bottom of the sea.

296
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,228
We're not though. Luffy saved us.

297
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,233
Are we really going to ignore
the elephant in the room right now?

298
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,944
You didn't think to mention
your grandfather was a Marine?

299
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,071
And not just any Marine, a vice-admiral!

300
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,991
Don't know about you.
I didn't sign up for that.

301
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:18,954
You raided a Marine base.
Of course that'll make you a target.

302
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,123
If I stole the map,
no one would've known I was there,

303
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:24,042
as opposed to wrecking
a base commander's office.

304
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,252
[Sanji] Your bill, sir.

305
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,131
Ah.

306
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,430
Thank you, my good man.

307
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,809
No, sir. Thank you.

308
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,106
I'm not saying it's good
that the Marines are on our tail,

309
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,611
but we showed them
that they can't just roll over us.

310
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:54,782
This crew, our crew, can handle anything.

311
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,534
Who the hell is Monkey D. Luffy?

312
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,454
Here.

313
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,956
You seem to be confused
about the rules of the house,

314
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,084
but Baratie doesn't offer credit.

315
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,878
You eat, you pay.

316
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,547
I think you're confused.

317
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:14,927
The meal has already been paid for.
I just haven't given you the money yet.

318
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,011
Yeah, and how's that?

319
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,180
You can add it to my treasure tab.

320
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,516
And what, pray tell, is that?

321
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,227
I may not look like a big deal yet,

322
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,771
but you're talking
with the future King of the Pirates.

323
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,232
And as soon as I find the One Piece,
I'm gonna come back,

324
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,150
pay this bill in full,

325
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,194
and with interest.

326
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,487
[chuckles] I got a better idea.

327
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,405
[Luffy grunts]

328
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,451
I need a drink.

329
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,078
Yeah. Now you're talking.

330
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,415
You, Mr. Future-King-of-the-Pirates,
are gonna be my new chore boy.

331
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,335
You're gonna pay off your debt
washing dishes.

332
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,336
[Luffy grunts]

333
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,382
-All of these?
-[owner] For starters.

334
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,926
You gotta remember.
The meal you had with your friends?

335
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,886
That's one year's worth of dishes.

336
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:02,015
I'd get a move on if I was you.
Second service is in one hour.

337
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,854
-Oy, oy. What do you think you're doing?
-Come on, old man. Enough's enough.

338
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:10,065
Put the jacket back on, little eggplant.
You're not done with your shift yet.

339
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,109
Let me back on the line or I walk.

340
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,111
You can walk back into the ocean
for all I care.

341
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,948
Cook another meal like that in my kitchen,
it's going right where the last one did.

342
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:22,202
You can kick me out of the kitchen
all you like. I'll never be a waiter.

343
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:26,373
That's fine by me. You sure as hell are
never gonna be a cook in my restaurant.

344
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,416
Have you got it?

345
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,091
[dance music plays]

346
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:48,979
Pace yourself.

347
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,733
I don't even think there's liquor in this.
It tastes just like candy.

348
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:56,069
Last time I said that,
I woke up face down under a table.

349
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,324
That glass have gold on the bottom
or what?

350
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,535
-[Nami] Hmm?
-You haven't stopped staring at it.

351
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,498
You seriously don't think
what Luffy did is messed up?

352
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,295
Yeah. He should've told us.

353
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,505
But in case you didn't notice,

354
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,716
we've been making enemies
everywhere we go.

355
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:22,262
Psycho clowns, killer butlers.
What's a vice-admiral gonna do to us?

356
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,889
No, you don't get it.

357
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,892
I can't get caught. Not when I'm so close…

358
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:34,441
Uh, who's ready for another drink?
My treat.

359
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:35,901
[Zoro] Mmm.

360
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,319
My favorite kind of drink.

361
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,159
Let me get your second-best bottle of rum.

362
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,911
-[bartender] Anything else?
-Yeah.

363
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:49,957
If I wanted to secure passage to
the Conomi Islands, who would I talk to?

364
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,333
[man] Uh, that'd be me.

365
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,712
It'll cost you.

366
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,756
-Six thousand.
-I have Berry.

367
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,176
[man] Need room for your friends too?

368
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,974
No. Just me.

369
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,269
I'm at slip 22.

370
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,437
Be ready to sail at dawn.

371
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,786
[sighs]

372
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,877
I know I'm going to regret this,
but what's wrong?

373
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,671
Nothing.

374
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,053
What you said back at Syrup Village

375
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:47,639
about Garp…

376
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:54,146
-I'm starting to think you might be right.
-What is it, my birthday?

377
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,939
Of course I'm right.

378
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,448
You ever hear of anyone called Mihawk?

379
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,618
Best swordsman in the world?

380
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,663
Better with a blade
than anyone in living history?

381
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:16,501
-One of the Seven Warlords of the Seas?
-Warlords?

382
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:23,050
Years ago, there were
these seven incredibly powerful pirates,

383
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,510
each one worse than the next.

384
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,095
They ruled the seas,

385
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,349
terrorizing everyone they came across.

386
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,934
The World Government
could've gone after them,

387
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,228
but that would've meant an all-out war.

388
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:41,151
They realized it'd be more useful
to keep them close, as allies.

389
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,154
So they struck a deal to work together.

390
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,283
Why would the Marines
need to work with pirates?

391
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,911
To do the things
they didn't want tied back to them.

392
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,997
In exchange,
the Warlords were given free rein.

393
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,082
To do pirate stuff?

394
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,335
Illegal pirate stuff?

395
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,715
Koby, you may know how to tie a knot,

396
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,636
but you don't know shit
about how the world works.

397
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,362
[Sanji] Hey, chore boy,

398
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,531
how's that dish pile coming along?

399
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,908
Never seems to get any smaller.

400
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,910
The old man's a real piece of work.

401
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:36,331
-Bet you regret giving him that IOU.
-I don't really do regret.

402
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,126
-No point in looking back.
-[Sanji] Lucky you.

403
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:42,295
Sometimes, when I try to look ahead,
all I see is back.

404
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,884
-How long you been a waiter?
-[Sanji] Not a waiter. I'm a cook.

405
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,511
Best one in the East Blue.

406
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,013
Not that it matters.

407
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,641
As long as the old man's in charge,
I'm banned from the line.

408
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:58,270
-But that meal you cooked was incredible.
-The True Bluefin Sauté?

409
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,771
-Yeah.
-[Sanji] You tried it?

410
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,983
Yeah, of course I did.
I couldn't help myself.

411
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,861
I didn't think the food here
could get any better.

412
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,406
You know, you're a really good cook.

413
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,700
-[Sanji] Eh.
-Why is Zeff making you wait tables?

414
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,868
[Sanji] 'Cause he's jealous.

415
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,161
I should be running this place,

416
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,371
but the old man's so stubborn,
it'll never happen.

417
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,707
So that's your dream.

418
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,209
To be head chef of the Baratie.

419
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:22,627
[Sanji] Nah.

420
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:29,050
So you love to cook.
You just don't want to cook here?

421
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,018
There's, um, this place

422
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:42,564
where you can find ingredients
from all four seas.

423
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:46,735
East Blue, West Blue, North, and South.
They call it the All Blue.

424
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,154
Nobody knows where it is, but

425
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,991
there's fish there
that have never been seen.

426
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:58,205
You know, rare seaweeds.
Spices that have never been tasted.

427
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:03,793
It is a cook's paradise,
and I'm gonna find it one day.

428
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,296
That's my dream.

429
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,133
If you want to cook, you should cook.

430
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:17,641
Don't let some stubborn old man
get in the way of your dream.

431
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:20,977
Stand up to him.

432
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,146
Tell him what you want.

433
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,651
It's more complicated than that.

434
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,029
I don't really do complicated either.

435
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,157

-[man] Help me.

436

Please.

Help me.

-Are you okay?
-I'm so hungry. Please.

442
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,470
Okay, you got it, man. How does
some corned-beef fried rice sound?

443
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,348
-What do you think you're doing?
-At Baratie, everyone eats.

444
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,559
Who's gonna pay for that?
This is a business.

445
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,812
We can't give handouts to every
down-on-his-luck pirate that washes up.

446
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,022
If a man is hungry, I feed him.

447
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,777
-Zeff kicked you off the line.
-I don't see the old man here. Do you?

448
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:12,862
Your funeral.

[upbeat music plays]

450
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,009
I was drifting out there for a week.

451
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,928
You saved my life tonight.

452
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,807
You're not only a good cook.
You're a good guy.

453
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,184
If Zeff doesn't appreciate you,

454
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,437
you should join my crew.

455
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,482
[Luffy] I'm serious. For real.

456
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,365
Sorry, chore boy. I've already got a job.

457
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,700
But you're not happy here.

458
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,120
And we're gonna need a great cook
if we're gonna find the One Piece.

459
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,080
The One Piece?

460
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,709
Yeah, I'm gonna find it
and become King of the Pirates.

461
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,544
We were searching for it too.

462
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,799
I was part of a mighty pirate armada.

463
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:20,347
Our captain was hell-bent
on finding Gold Roger's treasure, but

464
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,016
the Grand Line was his undoing.

465
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,687
We lost 50 ships and 5,000 men.

466
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,939
I was the only survivor.

467

Save yourself.

468
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,155

-Sea slug.
-[Nami] That's it.

That's what he's like.

474
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,220
Look at him.
Like he doesn't have a care in the world.

What are you carrying around
that's so heavy?

-You have no idea.
-I bet I do.

than you do about me.

-Yeah, right. You're an open book.

-You must be thirsty.
-You're saying I'm wrong?

487
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,229
I grew up in a small village.

521
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,068
A green recruit like yourself.

522
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,613
I came in with simple ideals,
but I had to adapt,

523
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,241
because the world is not a simple place.

524
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,412
The same set of laws
do not apply to everyone.

525
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,746
But that's not fair.

526
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,706
No, it's not.

527
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,626
But you have to decide
if you can live with that.

528
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,839
I could've been fleet admiral by now,

529
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:25,508
but I always turned down the promotion.
Do you know why?

530
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,888
Because I'd have to do things their way.

531
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,807
I'd lose my freedom.

532
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,019
Do you understand?

533
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,355
Yes, sir.

534
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,815
The world is not fair.

535
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:48,156
But the Marines are all that are standing
between order and anarchy.

536
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,326
So, let me ask you…

537
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,913
can you live with that?

538
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,583
I think so.

539
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,044
Hmm.

540
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,216
That uniform.

541
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,846
It's starting to fit you after all.

542
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:20,021
[slurring] And then they aimed
their biggest, baddest cannons at us.

543
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,983
But I wasn't scared,

544
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,070
being that I'm the best shot
in the East Blue.

545
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,198
So I fired at 'em. [imitates explosion]

546
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,075
And again. [imitates explosion]

547
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,034
And again.

548
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,870
Boom, boom, boom.

549
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,873
Down goes their yard.
Marines dead in the water.

550
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,543
All thanks to the great Captain Usopp.

551
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,461
So,

552
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:45,838
you're the captain?

553
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,550
Well, technically, no.

554
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:53,304
But I did distract them so that Luffy,

555
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,598
who's, like, the official captain,

556
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,685
could bounce that ball back. Boom.

557
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,397
I should very much like
to meet this Luffy.

558
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,526
Sure.

559
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,029
Heck, come meet the whole crew.

560
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,909
Guys, meet my new best friend.

561
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:19,747
-What did you say your name was again?
-Which one of you is Monkey D. Luffy?

562
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,791
[Nami] Who wants to know?

563
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,087
You're Dracule Mihawk.

564
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,172
[ominous music plays]

565
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,634
I have business with your captain.

566
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,303
If you know what's good for you,
you'll hand him over.

567
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:37,515
[Nami] We don't know anyone named Luffy.
Right, Zoro?

568
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,267
Zoro?

569
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,605
I've been following your career
since I was a child.

570
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,692
-It's an honor to finally meet you, sir.
-Thank you.

571
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,486
Which is why it pains me

572
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,280
to inform you that tomorrow…

573
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,451
you're going to die.

574
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,410
Wait, what?

575
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:02,999
I, Roronoa Zoro, challenge you to a duel

576
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,501
to the death.

577
00:34:12,257 --> 00:34:13,676
I've never heard of you.

578
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,844
They call me the Demon Pirate Hunter.

579
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:21,476
But my lifelong dream
is to best you in single combat

580
00:34:22,476 --> 00:34:25,063
and become
the greatest swordsman in the world.

581
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,398
You're serious.

582
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,900
Accept my challenge.

583
00:34:30,275 --> 00:34:31,819
You'll see how serious I am.

584
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,280
Very well.

585
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,743
Tomorrow at dawn.

586
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,038
And when I'm done with you, pirate hunter,

587
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,916
I'll take your captain.

588
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,175
What the hell did you just do?

589
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,731
Right, are we done yet?

590
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:13,778
You're lousy at it.

591
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,364
But at least you do as you're told
in this kitchen.

592
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,325
If you think Sanji's gonna give up
on his dream because of you,

593
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,618
then forget it.

594
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,704
-Excuse me?
-You heard me.

595
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,792
You may have banned him from the line,
but you can't stop him from cooking.

596
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,794
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, really.

597
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,673
This starving pirate washed up earlier,
and you know what Sanji did?

598
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:37,009
He cooked for him,
right here in your kitchen,

599
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:41,514
because your rules matter less to him
than making sure a hungry man got fed.

600
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,684
He did that, did he?

601
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,728
What a good kid.

602
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,483
Luffy, we've got a problem.

603
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,736
[Nami] Maybe you can convince him
to call it off.

604
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,323
-[Zoro] I won't do that.
-Did you see the size of that guy's sword?

605
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,993
-He will slice you into sashimi.
-What's going on?

606
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,286
I'll tell you what's going on.

607
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:07,331
Your big, bad Marine grandpa
sent a Warlord of the Sea to bring you in,

608
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,417
and instead of
getting the hell out of here,

609
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,002
Zoro challenged him to a duel.

610
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:11,919
Which he accepted.

611
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,840
You are a fly to him.
Something to be swatted and forgotten.

612
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,550
-Not if I win.
-[Nami] You're not going to.

613
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,678
-You don't know that.
-Guys, guys, maybe we need more drinks.

614
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,599
Tell your first mate
he'll get himself killed.

615
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,392
Tell your navigator to butt out.

616
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,021
Maybe this isn't such a great idea, Zoro.

617
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,233
When you met me tied up on that cross,
what did I say?

618
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,152
"What makes you think
I wanna play pirates?"

619
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,487
-No, the other thing.
-"I kill your kind for a living"?

620
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,989
No. Come… [groans]

621
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:41,490
Oh.

622
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,621
That you made a promise to someone
a long time ago

623
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,289
to be the world's greatest swordsman.

624
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:52,543
The only way to do that is to beat Mihawk
in a duel and take his title.

625
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,754
I intend to do just that.

626
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,714
Even if you die in the process?

627
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,509
Will you please do something?

628
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,639
It's his dream, Nami.

629
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,392
I can't get in the way
of somebody's dream.

630
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:11,938
What's it gonna take, huh?

631
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,566
You want me to say you're the best?
You're the best. Okay?

632
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,903
You're the best I've ever seen,
but you are not better than him.

633
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,447
And if you fight him tomorrow,
you're going to lose.

634
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,782
Why do you give a shit?

635
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,701
Because you're my friend, you idiot.

636
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,830
You said it yourself.
You don't have any friends.

637
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,270
[throwing up]

638
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,684
[man] Well,

639
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,353
coming aboard?

[man grunts]

641
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,881
[Mihawk] Monkey D. Luffy.

642
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:07,720
I'm surprised the Marines would require
my services for such a small package.

643
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,974
-Though I do like your hat.
-[Zoro] Enough.

644
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,603
Let's begin.

645
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,188
[pasodoble music plays]

646
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,988
What is that? I'm here for a sword fight.

647
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,074
I don't hunt rabbits with a cannon.

648
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:33,996
I'm no rabbit.

649
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,999
That remains to be seen.

650
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,752
[suspenseful action music plays]

651
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,820
Got you on the run, huh?

652
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,240
Hardly.

653
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,037
[Mihawk] You're strong.

654
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,832
But fighting isn't all about strength.

655
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,375
Stop talking and fight.

656
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,379
You're like a little frog
croaking in a well.

657
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,381
Croak. Croak. Croak.

658
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,818
[panting]

659
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:49,155

661
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,258
Why don't you retreat?

662
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,638
I can't…

663
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,435
or my dream will be lost forever.

664
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,321
You're brave. I'll give you that.

665
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:41,165
So I'll do you the honor
of killing you with Yoru.

666
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,927
That's more like it.

667
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,661
Come on.

668
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,997
[suspenseful music swells]

669
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,441
[Zoro gasps]

670
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:54,530
[Mihawk] You're defeated.
Why do you persist?

671
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:01,954
Wounds on the back
are a swordsman's greatest shame.

672
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,089
Magnificent.

673
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:35,988
Zoro!

674
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,116
[emotional music plays]

675
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:49,126
[Mihawk] Monkey D. Luffy,
what's your goal?

676
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,921
I'm going to become
the King of the Pirates.

677
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,215
King of the Pirates, hey?

678
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:59,678
That's a much more treacherous path
than even defeating me.

679
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,555
I don't care.

680
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,683
It's what I'm going to do.

681
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,185
Hmm.

682
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,270
Maybe you will at that.

683
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,650
This world could use
a few more wild cards.

684
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,194
Roronoa Zoro,

685
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,821
it's too soon for you to die.

686
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,824
Grow strong and come find me.

687
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:22,534
I'll be waiting.

688
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,628
He's losing so much blood.

689
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:35,839
He's gonna be okay.

690
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,008
Hey, Zoro, can you hear me?

691
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,470
He said it's too soon for you to die.

692
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,013
[Zoro] Luffy.

693
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:48,060
If I fail to become
the world's greatest swordsman…

694
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,856
you'll be disappointed.

695
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,316
Right?

696
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,360
You could never fail me.

697
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,323
Never…

698
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,201
again.

699
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:06,578
From now…

700
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:09,623
until I beat him.

701
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,255
To become the greatest swordsman…

702
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,884
I will never lose again!

703
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:29,643
Zoro?

704
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,277
Zoro?!

705
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,366
Zoro!

he killed your friend's lawyer

and he's threatening to kill your friend?

He's up to something.

are you?

Well, I'm telling the truth.
Klahadore is a pirate. No, sorry. Kuro.

-His name is Captain Kuro.
-Ha! Now I know you're lying.

-Captain Kuro of the Black Cat Pirates?
-Yes. Long claws, tiny glasses.

Impossible. My father,
Axe-Hand Morgan, killed him years ago.

No, not those pirates. The other pirates.

-Usopp, you're not making any sense.
-Please, Kaya, we gotta get out of here.

I'm not going anywhere.
It's the middle of the night.

How about I ring for Klahadore?
We can have--

183
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,705
No, don't call Klahadore!

184
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,583
He's the one trying to hurt you.

185
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,462
He killed Merry.

186
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,464
Merry?

187
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,300
He was here only a few hours ago.

188
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,052
Yeah. Now he's dead.

189
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,679
Klahadore isn't a butler.

190
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,722
He's…

191
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,766
he's a vicious pirate.

192
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,019
Usopp, you're scaring me.

193
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:38,609
Klahadore gave up his life to care for me.
Why would he want to hurt me? Hurt Merry?

194
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,027
I… I don't know.

195
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,530
Maybe he wants your money.

You always believe me.

I believed your stories
because they were fun. This one isn't.

201

It's the truth. You gotta listen!

She was hiding.

216

[Nami] Think about it, Kaya.
When did you start getting sick?

Was it around the time
Kuro started working here?

00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,686
No, they'd want you to survive,

what we are going to do.

I was just waiting for Kuina.

Do you know where she is?

00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,337
Kuina is…

372
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:24,971
There was an accident.

She's…

She's gone.

she can't be.

I am a pirate.

00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:24,351
And how long have you been on the seas?
A week? A month?

501
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,480
I was a captain for years,

502
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,524
and I never failed in a raid.

503
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,151
Not once.

504
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,486
And what did I get in return?

505
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,196
A life of worry

506
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,575

[Kuro] Is that what you want?

00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:50,252
A lifetime of always
looking over your shoulder.

00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,676
[Kuro] You'll never get
a peaceful night's rest

514
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,513
because someone's always waiting
to slit your throat.

515
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,682
Pirates, Marines.

516
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:06,518
Why, even your own crew.

517
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,605
Not my crew.

518
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,609
We've got each other's backs.

519
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:15,611
Always.

00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,279
Ay!

00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,031
[Kuro] Until the day they don't.

522
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,743
I've killed more crewmates
than I care to remember.

523
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,954
They're expendable.
Every single one of them.

[hisses]

529
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:10,207
Being a pirate is not about
raiding villages or perfect plans.

530
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,085
It's about adventure.

531
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,045
And freedom.

532
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,297
[Kuro laughs]

533
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,177
[Kuro] Freedom?

534
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:26,098
There's no such thing
with a bounty on your head.

535
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,562
You gave up on your dream.

536
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:37,192
No one who does that
can ever call themselves a pirate.

537
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,869
[Kuro laughs]

538
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,960
Looks like you're the one giving up now.

539
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:57,713
No.

540
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,632
I'm done talking.

541
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,844
Now I'm listening.

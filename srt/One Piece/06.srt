[Nami] Easy. Easy!

2
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:09,801
Easy.

3
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:12,053
Easy. Don't drop him.

4
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,222
I didn't. He's really heavy.

5
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:17,517
I mean, he's got a really big head.
It's, like, freakishly big.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,602
[Nami] What does that
have to do with anything?

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,480
-Zoro? Hey, can you hear me?
-[Usopp] Where's the first aid kit?

8
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,774
-[Nami] Do we have a first aid kit?
-Zoro?

00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,989
[Usopp] These are all I could find.
Where's he bleeding from?

10
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:31,948
[Nami] Everywhere.

11
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:34,159
-[Usopp] We need more towels.
-[Nami] We need a doctor.

12
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,869
[Usopp] Last I checked, we don't have one.

13
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,704
[Nami] Luffy? Luffy!

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,249
Someone needs to go back to Baratie.

15
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,252
Um, I'm really not hungry right now, Nami.

16
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,712
[Nami] Not for food.

17
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,214
Maybe one of the customers
is a ship's doctor.

18
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,717
Right. A doctor.

19
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,969
We need a doctor.

20
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,557
-[Zeff] What do you think you're doing?
-Chopping carrots, chef.

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,976
Yeah, I can see that.
But why are you doing it in my kitchen?

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,061
I demoted you, remember?

23
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,772
That you did. But Patty's
sleeping off a brutal hangover,

all by yourself…

Fine.

26
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,697
Them carrots are cut too thick.

27
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,075
And those eggs are way too runny.

28
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:20,288
And I can tell just by looking at that,
that rémoulade needs a lot more oregano.

29
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,124
Oregano is for savages.

Help! Help! Zoro… Zoro needs a doctor.

32
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,049
He got into a fight with this warlord guy,
but he lost.

-Whoa. Whoa. Slow down, Chore Boy.

It's a two-day sail from here.

00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,561
I can't help you.
Hope your friend makes it.

Where do you think you're going?

39
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,982
-To help Chore Boy's friend.
-Brunch is not gonna prep itself.

40
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,859
You always told me
to feed anyone who's hungry.

41
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,820
I don't see how this is any different.

43
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:54,906
Fine.

44
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,785
Bring me my kitchen knives
and a bottle of our best whiskey.

45
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,830
And a fresh yellowtail from the cooler.
Bigger the better.

46
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:02,872
A yellowtail?

47
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,541

Do you wanna save
your swordsman friend or not?

51
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,232
-Is that to sterilize the wounds?
-[Zeff] Hell, no.

52
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,234
That'd be a waste of really good liquor.

53
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:35,530

Fish skin.

56
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,806
This is an old seaman's trick.

57
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:07,103
The fish skin helps staunch the wounds
and heals the flesh a lot faster.

58
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,022
Is he gonna be okay?

59
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,274
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.
He's lost a lot of blood.

60
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,320
-It might be too late for him.
-But it might not be.

61

He's got one foot in each world right now,
caught between life and death.

You have to find a way
to keep him tethered to our world.

Talk to him. Tell him stories.
Sing him sea shanties for all I care.

00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,835
He may not reply,

65
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,380
but at least he'll know
his crew are still with him.

we might have privately.

00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,568
Aye, sir.

-At the moment, I don't know.
-What do you mean, you don't know?

75
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,000
I decided to let him go.

76

I specifically told you
to bring him to me.

No more and no less.

00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,438
And what I want

84
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,609
is to see what becomes of that young man
when he enters the Grand Line.

to get Zoro's sword ready for him.

You know, for when he wakes up.

pretty badly hurt, man.

Zoro's favorite food?

Sure. What does he like?

-He really likes rice balls.
-Mm-hmm.

so that he gets back his strength.

127
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,972
But I also want him to sleep
so that his wounds can heal.

maybe he just needs some water. Right?

he's probably also tired, so…

Who are you, old man?

360
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,329
My name is Zeff.

361
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,081
And I own this place.

362
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,874
Well, I'm Arlong.

363
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,085
And I own the East Blue.

364
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,378
No one owns the sea.

366
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:52,759
Well, that's about to change,
once you give me what I want.

367
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:53,677
Ooh.

368
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:59,224
[Arlong] Listen up. I'm looking
for a pirate in a straw hat.

369
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,268
Goes by the name of Luffy.

370
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,063
He has something that belongs to me.

371
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,816
Straw hat, you say, hmm?

372
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:08,733
No.

373
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,278
That's not familiar.

374
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,905
But why don't I fix you a meal?

375
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:18,118
Absolutely anything you want
off of that menu, no charge.

376
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,912
Well, I already have a meal.

377
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:24,916
But if you don't bring me
the straw-hat boy before I finish,

378
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,962
maybe I might just start adding
some of these nice folks to the menu.

He hasn't said a word.

383
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,695
Didn't Zeff say we're supposed
to talk to him? Tell him stories?

384

What would I say?

385
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,948
[Usopp] Whatever pops in your head.

386

Just… speak from the gut.

Let me start over.

The Arlong Pirates are at Baratie.
We have to leave now.

-Because they're looking for you.

-Me?
-[Nami] And the map.

403
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,559
Those fishmen will tear this place apart
if Zeff doesn't turn him over.

Where are you going?

405

If Baratie's in danger,
I need to be there.

-I'm coming with you.
-[Nami] Did you not hear what I just said?

They are hunting you. We need to run.

408
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,030
I'm with Nami on this one. I'm really not
trying to ruffle any feathers or scales--

409

I'm not running.
We're going to protect this place.

This isn't your fight.
Why would you do that?

Look, I know this crew.
Their captain, Arlong,

00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,334
has the highest bounty
in all of the East Blue.

-You do not want to mess with him.
-It sounds like he messed with us first.

Please.

I can't let innocent people get hurt
because of me.

If those fishmen guys want a fight,

we're gonna give them one.

420
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,398
You stay with the ship

You never seen a fishman enjoy a meal?

427

That's because you don't know any fishmen,

You see,

most fishmen would be happy
to sit at the same table as a human.

435
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,037
They want to be treated as equals.

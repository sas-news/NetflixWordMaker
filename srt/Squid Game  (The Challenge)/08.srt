in-- in sports and stuff.

I tried, like, every sport in the book,
and, of course, nothing stuck.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,640
It was stressful. Like, there--
there are expectations that are set up.

And, like, you w--

[Mai] I can't believe I'm in the final 12.
It's unbelievable.

339
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,800
But 278 doesn't deserve to be here.

340
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,680
If I get the opportunity,
I have to eliminate her.

341
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,720
[powering down]

342
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,640
[beeps]

343
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,080
[keyboard clacking]

344
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,600
-Whoa, whoa!
-[Bee gasps]

345
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,000
-[Chad] What the heck?
-Oh my God!

346
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,960
What?!

347
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,400
-[Chad] Wow! What the hell?
-[Roland] How is it actually this empty?

348
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,200
-[Amanda] What?
-[Chad] Basically, all the beds are gone.

349
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,200
Such an eerie feeling.

350
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,360
We went from hundreds
of people staying here

351
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,440
to only 12 of us in this massive dorm.

352
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,280
This is weird.

353
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,240
[Ashley] This shit's so empty, bro.

354
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Everybody gone.

355
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,560
-Good work.
-Good work.

356
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,880
[laughs]

357
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,600
-I love you, Roland. I really do.
-I love you too, Mai.

358
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,280
I'm so glad you're still in this.

359
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,440
[Ashley] I don't know these people
from a can of paint.

360
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,280
I immediately felt that cliquey shit,
and I'm irritated as hell.

361
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,000
[Purna] This feels good, man!

362
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,600
[Ashley] And also, I'm feeling scared

363
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,320
'cause I'm like,
they're gonna get another chance

364
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,160
to, like, vote people to eliminate,

365
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,360
and they're gonna eliminate
floaters like me first.

366
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,960
Guys, the only reason why
we made it through with this many people

367
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,040
is 'cause we worked together, okay?
All right.

368
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,720
[scattered applause]

369
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,160
[ominous tone plays]

370
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,079
So, my mom and dad,
they were married when I was super young,

371
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,319
but I never seen them together.

372
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,960
Both of them, I would say, you know,
"got it out the mud," you know.

373
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,520
Uh, neither one of them grew up,
you know, with their parents.

374
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,400
They kinda had to,
you know, get it on their own.

375
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,000
You know, make a way
for themselves in the world.

376
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:24,160
Um, I would describe my mom
as, you know, strong, tough love,

377
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,520
you know, hard exterior.

378
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,880
You know, hard exterior.

379
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,360
And she raised me
to be tough, just like her.

380
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,480
Um, so I also have a hard exterior,

381
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,280
and you know, it takes some knocking down.

382
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,560
You know, I have to knock down some walls
before I let people in.

383
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,800
[musical swell plays and rises]

384

[ominous tone plays]

385
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,320
-[Ashley] How you feeling?
-[Mai] Mixed emotion.

386
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,560
[Ashley] Yeah, same.

387
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,080
It's, like, you happy you made it,
but also-- Yeah.

388
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,120
-[Mai] It's sad. Yeah.
-Lost some homies.

389
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,200
So it doesn't feel good.

390
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,680
[buzzer plays on speakers]

391
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,560
Okay, let's make a line.
Let's hug and let's make a line.

392
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,000
[creepy choral music plays]

393
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,320
Attention, players.
Here are the results of the fifth game.

394
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,520
[scattered cheers]

395
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,800
[Chad] There we go.

396
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,400
-[Amanda] Whoo! There we are!
-[Phill] Yay.

397
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,440
[device beeps]

398
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,400
[clanging]

399
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,680
[Chad] Hey, there we go.

400
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,960
[applauding]

401
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,920
Let's go.

402
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,560
Fill that piggy up!

403
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,040
[gentle music plays]

404
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,280
[Bee] Wow.

405
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,400
[Amanda whoops]

406
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,320
[chiming digitally]

407
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,600
[square guard] The current prize fund
now stands at $4,440,000.

408
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,600
[Chad] Oh! 444!

409
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,320
[square guard] There are
only 12 of you left.

410
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,280
Eleven other players stand between you

411
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,320
and $4.56 million.

412
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,000
[intriguing music plays]

413
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,720
The next test is tomorrow,

414
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,520
and it will be played face-to-face.

415
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,000
-[man] Wow.
-Oh my gosh.

416
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,720
[Chad] Could be tough
to sleep tonight. Whoa!

417
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,200
The feeling is odd
between the team right now.

418
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,560
The piggy bank,
it's almost to the top at this point.

419
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,000
We all remember
when it was completely empty.

420
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,000
It feels like it was months ago.

421
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,960
-We can sit over there.
-[Sam] Yeah.

422
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,160
[Chad] It's a very strange feeling
because we definitely miss our friends,

423
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,520
but we know that we are very, very close
to winning that ultimate prize.

424
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,560
[Phill] I miss Jackie.

425
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,400
[Sam] I miss Jackie too.
She was always such a calming presence.

426
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,520
I'm really proud of her.

427
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,800
I'm-- I'm beyond proud of her as well.
I'm so proud.

428
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,320
I don't know. I had this stupid idea
that it'd be both of us together

429
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,440
until the end.

430
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,520
[Roland] Hallie,
you're in a mood right now.

431
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,080
I know. Look at these skips.
Look at these skips.

432
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,200
This nervous energy
makes me uncomfortable.

433
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,280
[Rose laughs]

434
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,440
I hate this place.

435
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,680
[chuckles]

436
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,120
[musical swell plays]

437
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,520
[ominous tone plays]

438
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,920
I'm pretty confident in-- in my abilities
to hold my cards close to my chest.

439
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,720
I grew up a little gay boy
in a very religious family.

440
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,160
It felt like I couldn't be myself

441
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,880
because if I was myself, I was at risk

442
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,120
because the talk was constantly

443
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,720
about how people like me
were going to hell

444
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,760
or they were going to die
because of their decisions.

445
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,880
And so,

446
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,960
I tried everything as a kid to not be gay.

447
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,120
I made-- You know,
I tried making deals with God.

448
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,400
I tried-- I j--

449
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,720
I feel like I tried everything
that a-- that a kid could think of.

450
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:55,440
And after I left home and came out

451
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,360
and lost my family to their prejudices,

452
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,560
I've built a new family,

453
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,320
and I have other people
who have filled those roles

454
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,000
in a better way than the…

455
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,880
than my blood or relation ever has.

456
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,400
[musical swell plays]

457
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,560
[ominous tone plays]

458
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,440
I'm dreading the next test.

459
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,960
You're gonna finally
get me out, aren't you?

460
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,440
That's gonna be the moment.

461
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,440
[laughs]

462
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,120
Oh, it's the moment
we've all been waiting for.

463
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,640
No one is safe.
It's anyone's game, completely.

464
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,840
Even, like-- like, today showed that.

465
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,680
[Bee] The fact that player 019 and I
are still here together,

466
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,680
when we were both next to each other
at Red Light, Green Light, it's unreal.

467
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,520
The two of us in the final 12 means
that one of us winning is one in six,

468
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,320
which is…

469
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,280
We-- We would never have believed that.

470
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,960
[Amanda] Yeah, I liked that.

471
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,920
[Chad] We've gone down to 12 people.

472
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,880
Twelve people.

473
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,160
It's so-- I'm like, "Oh my God."
I can't grasp it. Like, wow.

474
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,720
-[Chad] Twelve people, 444 out.
-[Mai] Yeah.

475
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,360
-[sighs]
-444 people out.

476
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,040
We're down to 12.

477
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,080
If I-- If I have a choice,

478
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,320
it gonna be me and you, but head-to-head.

479
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,680
-That'd be great. You're gonna go 100%?
-That'd be awesome.

480
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,320
Yep. And you gonna go 100%.

481
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,280
Yeah, I'll-- I'll go 99.
I'll give you a percent.

482
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,680
[both laugh]

483
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,440
[gentle music plays]

484
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,800
[Mai] Talking to Chad,

485
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,280
we are solidifying our friendship,
uh, to take us to the final.

486
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,800
We don't wanna be super vocal,
and we wanna strategize

487
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,800
how to move forward,
you know, with, um, with the two of us.

488
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,440
I don't think there's a person in here
that we have to worry about,

489
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,640
like, backstabbing or anything like that.

490
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,800
-I don't know. We'll see.
-[Chad] Yeah.

491
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,000
I mean, with-- with that much money
on the line, anything's possible.

492
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,880
Yeah. Yeah.

493
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,520
My close friendship
with Chad is wonderful,

494
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,720
but at the moment,

495
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,320
I want to hide my-- my agendas

496
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,400
because, you know, I don't feel
that I can trust anyone completely.

497
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,920
Now, it's like, you know,
it's a pack of wolves now

498
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,600
trying to get a piece of meat.

499
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,240
-[Chad] Insane.
-Hello!

500
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,880
-[Chad laughs]
-[Bee] Hello.

501
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,720
-[Elliott] Hello there!
-[Amanda] Hello! Ho!

502
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,920
How are you Londoners over there?

503
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,040
We're-- We're, uh--
We're plotting and planning.

504
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,000
[Mai laughs]

505
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,960
[Chad] There's plenty of beds available,

506
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,840
but I see Bee, Elliott, and Amanda

507
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,040
all still keep bunk beds together.

508
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,360
So that's concerning me.

509
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,160
People are scheming
because that money is real,

510
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,240
and everybody wants that cash.

511
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,320
We have to make sure
that we're watching to make sure

512
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,280
there's not an alliance coming
to take-- to take us out.

513
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,440
-Thank you, Chad, for being here.
-Thank you.

514
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,920
Of course. I'm not allowed to go
until you tell me I can.

515
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,240
[laughs] Stop it.

516

My Amanda.

519
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,320
How have we done this?

520
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,840
-Someone up there's looking out for you.
-Yeah.

521
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,280
[Ashley] Okay, let me
just say this though.

522
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,880
If we have another test and a vote,

523
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,520
we should all rally up and vote,
like, for real,

524
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,200
'cause they got numbers over there
in they little crew.

525
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,400
[Sam] Yeah.

526
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,680
I-- God, I hope it's not a vote.

527
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,000
It's gonna be another test.
And we gonna have to break that up.

528
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
'Cause if we don't,
then it's gonna be them.

529
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,240
[Sam] Yeah.

530
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,720
And it is crazy 'cause it's like,
you don't wanna do

531
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,200
no weird-ass backstabbing shit

532
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,160
'cause you still representing yourself.
You get what I'm saying?

533
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,760
And I don't move like that.

534
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,680
Like, I just wanna compete
and play the games,

535
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,080
but then you gotta deal with this, like--

536
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,600
I mean, I love Bee and Amanda,
but it's like--

537
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,000
[Ashley] Yeah. I mean, they cool,
but at the end of the day,

538
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,720
if it came down to it,
they'd vote one of us out over them.

539
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,040
They'd pick them over us.

540
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,960
Yeah.

541
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,480
100%.

542
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,400
[Sam] I feel really good
about Phill and Ashley making it through.

543
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,960
We are making alliances.

544
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,200
And if our strengths
can eliminate another player,

545
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,560
there are no hard feelings,

546
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,600
and we should take our place,

547
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,560
rightfully, in the finale.

548
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,800

[ominous tone plays]

586

My family, they moved to Nepal in 1992,

587
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,760
and that's where I was born.

588
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,240
Uh, my mom was nine months pregnant
when she came to Nepal

589
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,840
and started her life as a refugee.

590
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,920
Um, I was there for 16 years.

591
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
We never had any electricity,
and it was very poor medical care,

592
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,560
and it was a tough life.

593
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,560
I have seen people dying
from fever or simple diseases,

594
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,480
and I have seen people struggle for food,

595
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,480
like, what they're gonna eat the next day,

596
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,200
and I thought that was normal.

597
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,920
[chuckles] I thought that's what life is.

598
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,680
But now when I see, now when I look back,

599
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,320
I-- I realize how tough it was,

600
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,040
and I need to be the hope
for the people who are still struggling

601
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,960
and who are still fighting
every day for food, for their life.

602

625
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,960
[square guard] Before the test begins,
you must select a leader.

626
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,800
I'll-- I'll be if you want.

627
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,440
[Hallie] I was gonna volunteer--

628
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,320
-I will.
-…but if there's other volunteers…

629
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,160
[Chad] Well, let-- let's-- let's make
arguments for the people,

630
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,760
and I'll start
because you know where I'm going.

631
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,080
Mai has been my go-to from the beginning.

632
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,200
I know she'll be fair to all of us.

633
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,160
That's-- That's my candidacy
for-- for Mai.

634
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,360
Do you know what? I-- I think Mai--
Mai would be my choice to be fair.

635
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,360
Thank you.

636
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,600
-[Roland] I'm with that.
-[Phill] All in favor of Mai?

637
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,000
-[Rose] Yeah. I am.
-[agreeing]

638
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,400
[Mai] Volunteering myself
is taking control of the game.

639
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,240
It gives me an advantage
so that I can be in control

640
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,160
of my destiny and my fate.

641
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,360
[square guard] Player 287,
when instructed, you should roll the die.

642
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,360
If you roll a six,
one player must be eliminated.

644
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,960
Before you roll, you must
either choose to nominate yourself

645
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,480
or you must nominate one other player
to be at risk of elimination.

You okay, Mai?

650
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,440
[square guard] The test will continue
until three players are eliminated.

[droning, gloomy music plays]

652
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,000
[Elliott] Can I just say,
in theory, if we all nominate ourselves,

653
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,800
then it is-- is a game of chance.

654
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,440
[Roland and Elliott]
It's the friendliest way to do it.

655
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,560
We all know what we're rolling for.
We're rolling to stay in.

656
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,720
If we get a six, it's--
We're not meant to stay.

657
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,400
It's complete chance.
There's no-- There's no maliciousness.

658
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,320
Everybody--
Everybody agrees to it, I think.

659
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,280
We're all taking the gun, pulling
the trigger, and hoping it doesn't blow.

660

-[Chad] Mai-- Mai will set the standard.
-[Sam] Yep.

661
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,040
[Sam and Chad] And we'll go from there.

662
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,680

663
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,000

[tense percussive music plays]

Um, I worked just as hard

669

to be in the final 12,
just as everyone else.

670
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:53,040
And as a team yesterday,
we needed everyone to be part of it,

671
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,600
and I'm sorry, Ashley,
I have to nominate you.

672

00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,280
[Ashley] I'm pissed.
You're saying that I'm not a team player,

674
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,760
but in this moment,
you're not being a team player

675
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,280
because that's not what we agreed upon.

676
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,680
[square guard] Player 278,
you are at risk of being eliminated

677
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,880
if player 287 rolls a six.

678
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,720
[Chad] I don't know what's going on.
Mai definitely caught me off-guard.

679
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,800
I think it's a bad look,
but it's the game we're playing, I guess.

680
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,920
[square guard] Player 287,
you should now roll the die.

684
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,400
[square guard] Player 287,

685
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,120
you chose to put player 278
at risk of elimination.

686
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,400
You have not rolled a six,
so they are safe.

687
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,760
[Ashley] Girl, I don't know why
you thought you had the power

688
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,160
to get me up out of here.
Like, it doesn't work that way.

689
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,200
Like, my destiny is on me,
not on your ass.

690
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,960
[square guard] Player 287, you must now
choose who to pass the die on to.

691
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,040
[Hallie] Seeing Ashley thrown
under the bus,

692
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,400
and no one speak up about it is hard.

693
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,560
But hopefully,
everyone can keep nominating themselves,

694
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,120
and it doesn't have to get ugly.

695
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,240

[tense ethereal music plays]

697
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,480
I nominate myself 'cause we ball.

699
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,400
[Roland] Thank you, guys.

700
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,760
[Amanda] Well done.

701
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,440
[Roland] People can work together.

702
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,320
Even when we're this close
to $4.56 million,

703
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,080
we're gonna work as one.

704
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,040
[square guard] Player 418,
as you nominated yourself,

705
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,160
if you roll a six, you will be eliminated.

706
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,920
Never rolled a six in my entire life,
and I'm not starting today.

707
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,920
Okay.

We-- We all have to go,
so let's just calm down.

-Let's go, Sam.
-I nominate myself.

719
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,600
I feel way more comfortable
taking a game of chance

720
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,600
than strategy and backstabbing.

721
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,159
[Sam sighs heavily]

722
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,080
[Phill] I've been friends with player 016
throughout this entire process,

723
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,400
and seeing him go
just on a dice roll would not seem fair.

[Bee] It's very tense
watching people roll the dice.

I'm just waiting for it to be my turn now.

731
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,720
I play a lot of backgammon,
and I'm really good at rolling sixes,

732
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,480
which is good in backgammon
but will get me eliminated in this game.

733
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,280

[Bee] I'm going over in my head
what I want to do

740
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,520
in the face of calculated strategy
versus what I usually do,

741
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,040
which is take a chance and wing it.

I'm going to nominate myself.

743
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,800
And by the way,
I always roll sixes, so, like…

because I played a game true to who I am,

and I did everything I could
to enjoy every step of this competition,

at least from me,

you selected somebody in the group.

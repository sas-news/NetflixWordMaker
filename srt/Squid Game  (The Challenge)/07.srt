[square guard] Player 393,
please pick one ally

00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,920
to join you in the next game.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,160
Only 12 more players
will survive this test.

The 11 players not picked
at the end of this test of allegiance

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,600
will be eliminated.

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,439
[Jackie] I'm picking this player

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,520
because I trust that they're going
to make the right decision.

[Phill sighs heavily]

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,520
[Amanda] That's it.
You can't trust anybody in here.

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,160
[sighs]

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,000
Pick a woman, Phill, please.

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,320
Please pick a woman.

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,560
[Jackie] Phill has been
my closest friend in here,

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,840
and I feel
like I can trust Phill completely.

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,920
[Phill] Making a choice like this
is never easy.

21
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,080
I know that
the precedent has been set by Amanda,

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,720
but in this moment,
my instinct is to choose Sam, player 016.

23
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,720
Sam has been
a very good friend up until now,

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,320
and he deserves every opportunity
to move forward in this competition.

25
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,120
I don't know what to do.

[dramatic musical flourish plays]

33
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,560
[Ashley] It is clear that, like, the women

34
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,360
are trying to kind of stick together
to the end,

35
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,400
but, you know, I selected Sam, 016,
'cause that's my guy,

36
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,440
and I wanna keep him around.

37
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,320
Player 023.

38
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,240

00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,200
[Hallie] I'm like,
"Hey, what about sticking together?"

[anxious choral music plays]

45
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,520
I just have to pray that they see me
as a teammate and an ally.

46
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,760
Representation does matter.

47
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,520
And so, I will continue to respect
what's been going on here today.

48
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,920

[kisses]

52
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,760
[Hallie] One way or another,
player 019's plan worked,

53
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,120
and all nine of the women
are standing in the top 20 right now.

54
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,800

can be saved from elimination.

and women,
but they are standing beside me,

58
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,840

to have to pick between you all.

[Trey] I'm trying to do
the people math in my head.

Hallie is in a friend group
with Elliott and Roland and James.

[Trey] I can't help
but feel a little nervous.

76
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,680
Like, who have I made
really good friends with,

77
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,800
and am I their number one?

79
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200

it would be…

Player 301.

you have the final pick in this test.

I don't wanna go home.

comes through for me here.

It is literally there.

but it is there. It's within grasp.

I can't believe it.

00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,720
[Chaz] A little PTSD. Kinda took me back
to elementary school.

-[Phill] Yeah.

[ominous tone plays]

139
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,880
I-- I feel
like I'm an introverted extrovert.

140
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,160
Um, uh, growing up, um, in Brazil,
when I was younger,

141
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,480
I was very extroverted.

142
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,160
I had a ton of friends.

143
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,200
And when I moved to America, um,
I was actually bullied pretty viciously…

144
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,920
[chuckles] …um, in middle school,

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,840
and that sort of, I think, put me

146
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,000
into a small shell, um,
that I sort of had to stay in for a while.

147
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,560
But it also kind of helped me
become more comfortable with being myself.

148
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,640
And so my motto is to pretty much
always avoid conflict and confrontation.

149
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,240
Um, and I did study psychology
in college as well,

150
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,480
so I think I have
a little bit more of an understanding

151
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,520
of how people's brains work.

152
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,000
But at the same time, I basically have
no strategy going into this.

153
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,880
Um, I'm kind of going in blind.

154
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,080
I really just have no idea
how this is gonna go.

155
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,360
You know, usually I'm pretty good
at reading the room,

156
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,920
and I'm definitely
a go-with-the-flow kind of guy.

157
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,600
So, that's definitely
my game plan, I guess.

158
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,680
[players chatter indistinctly]

159
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,040
Heart-to-heart.

160
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,360
I owe you my undying loyalty.

161
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,440
You have shown me

162
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,680
actions is more powerful than words.

163
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,480
You keep saying you got my back,

164
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,320
but today, you have proven…

165
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,000
[voice breaks] …you got my back.

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,200
-I love you, TJ.
-I love you too, Mai.

167
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,440
-And I mean it.
-I--

168
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,000
[Mai] I feel guilty because, you know,

169
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,960
I didn't trust him, but he has my back,

170
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,400
and he is my supporter.

171
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,760
I just have to put in my memory bank,

172
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,440
and maybe I can, you know, use it to see

173
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,560
if it's helpful in the next game.

174
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,520
-[Mikie] I'm in your debt.
-[Chad] No, you're not.

if there's something wrong now,

[TJ] It'll be all right.

350
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,400
The highest risk is number one.

351
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,680
I'm scared.

352
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,680
Of course I'm scared.

353
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,640

[ominous tone plays]

356
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,600
In my teens, uh, me and my friends,
we used to run from--

357
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,320
like, jump roofs.

358
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,400
So, in New York City,
all the houses are bunched up.

359
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,120
So we used to just run
and jump between the gaps

360
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,280
and from roof to roof.

361
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,000
And-- My mom's gonna kill me.

362
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,680
Um… [chuckles]

363
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,360
And, uh, there was one time
it was like a two-story,

364
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,400
and I tripped,
and I just fell in the garbage.

365
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,800
That-- That was scary
'cause I could have fell

366
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,280
on the concrete and hurt something.

367
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,640
But beyond that, I always say,
"Have you seen a giraffe fall?"

368
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,520
And people are like, "What? No."

369
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,480
And I'm like, "That's me."
Like, "I don't fall."

370
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,960
"It takes me too long to fall." [chuckles]

our game plan as a group

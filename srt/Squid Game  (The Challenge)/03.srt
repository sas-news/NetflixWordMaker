[Bryton] I mean,
I had issues with player 198,

Normally, I can blag something,

of "you're gonna get eliminated,"

No, you can get the phone if you want.

I will. [chuckles]

Chocolate muffin, whoever wants it.
Two minutes, that's what they said.

love chips and burgers."

"Why would they not love muffins?"

to lose their minds in this game,

bring me back down."

gonna make me feel better."

167
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,760
and in return, like,
I will also have a safe base with them.

168
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,720
I think that's so important in this game.

it's gonna be tug-of-war tomorrow?

[man] If it's following the wall map,
that's next.

176
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,920
I would definitely like to have
at least one strong guy.

177
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,120
In Big Chad, of course.

178
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,600
But I think everybody here wants Big Chad.

179
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,520
He's the biggest, baddest,
grizzly bear-looking dude here.

He wants it to pop out. [laughs]

188

Really good. Today's a win-win tug-of-war.

195
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,760
I need to stretch.

I know that my team
are very strong, very athletic,

202
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,120
and there's not really
anything to worry about.

203

and seeing the guys'
like, shredded, six-packs and like…

That, like-- That scares me.

206
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,680
Well, tug-of-war
is about more than just strength.

207
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,920
If we can stick together,
we're sticking together.

208

[Bryton] I'm prepared, I'm ready.

209
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,240
Being strong is my greatest attribute
in this whole entire game.

-[Trey] I feel nervous. You feel nervous?
-Really? Nah. [chuckles]

221
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,200
[Trey] I think a lot of people
have started becoming

222
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,840
really good friends with each other,

223
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,120
and every time there's a game,

224
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,360
it's kind of gonna be
a random slot of luck

if your friend
that you were just talking to

226
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,600

or not the next day.

Do you wanna get a squad?

-God bless them.
-[Stephen] Don't worry, Rick. We got you.

254
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,440
[Stephen] My first instinct,
we're about to line up

255
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,920
and play tug-of-war, so the gganbu gang
needs to stick together.

256

-[man] Good.
-It's 15.

260
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,280
[Bryton] This is tug-of-war.

261
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,000
Nobody's worried, nobody's stressed

262
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,360
because there are some large men
and strong men on our team,

263
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,800
but I see the other lines
and groups running around

264
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,280
like chickens with their head cut off.
But my line, we're chilling.

If y'all have a line, put your hand up.

266
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,720
We need three more.

267
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,480
They need help. Don't leave them hanging.

268
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,720
Y'all don't wanna be eliminated, agree!

271

If you are at the end of the line,
please go. Just go.

272
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,440
[Figgy] We have too many people
in our line.

273
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,160
If we do not get a team
by the time clock runs out,

274
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,440
we all might get eliminated.

275
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,760
Raise your hand
if you want 186 to get out of the line.

Be together with this.

Okay, okay. Calm.
Y'all don't wanna go home.

281
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,560
Just think about each other.
Don't think about y'all selves. Come on.

282
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,640
I will go, I will go. Okay, I--
I will go. Don't worry, it's fine.

283
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,880
Sit down. Hey, everybody sit down.

For what?

291
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,920
Control your emotions.
This is not a game of sympathy at all.

292
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,800
-Hey. You gotta breathe.
-It's all right.

293
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,520
-It's just, like, really stressing me out.
-Take a breath. It's okay.

294
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,320
-[453] I don't know why I'm crying.
-[182] It's okay. We're here together.

go against each other, we're here.

-[exhales slowly]

299
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200

[ominous tone plays]

301
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,080
When I retired from basketball,

302
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,320
I was making a very good, like,
very good check week-to-week.

303
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,080
Um, and my wife Sam is our saving grace

304
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,400
'cause, you know,
she had a hold of my money,

305
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,440
and I was like,
"Yo, just do what you gotta do."

306
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,880
And-- And when I fully retired,
I understood the troubles

307
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,360
and the daily worries about money,

308
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,840
and she humbled me a lot about that.

309
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,280
We do have money trouble sometimes,

310
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,600
and our time will come
when we will be financially rich.

311
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,960
Yet you have to be morally rich first

312
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,920
to truly appreciate the financially rich,

313
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,160

His line is bad.
They look weaker and smaller.

Me and my brothers grew up
playing this since I was, like, ten.

349
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,760

my complete teammates.

00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,320

in a sinking ship. I'm captain."

[Bryton] I choose the boat

I'm going to be good at, it's this.

Come on, guys.

745
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,800
I think everyone knew that I was
a bit different from other people

746
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,840
from, like, a really early age,

747
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,200
and it was around the age of nine, even,

748
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,640
that I-- I started feeling more isolated

749
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,240
and perhaps more depressed
than other people my age,

750
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,240
and acting out in ways that maybe
weren't normal for that age either.

751
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,400
Um, I take a lot of pride
in my intelligence.

752
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,200
I love reading books,
and I love challenging my brain.

753
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,200
I was in Mensa at the age of 13
with an IQ in the top 0.5% of the UK.

754
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,560
My parents really put me forward for it
because I think they wanted me

755
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,720
to see on paper
that I was capable. [laughs]

756
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,080
I didn't apply my intelligence very well
for a very long time.

757
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,400
We decided we're gonna put our ships

758
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,440
in two corners, slightly away.

759
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
The middle was left empty

760
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,360
because once people panic spray,
that's where they aim for.

761
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,800

and I'm feeling pretty amazing.

765
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,520
one thing you should know
is that, for some reason,

00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,800

00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,640
[Dan] Doc won that game for us.

990
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,480
And Doc, I don't need you
to know anything else. You're my hero.

991
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,120
-My kids are gonna love this.
-[players laugh]

992
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,480
This is my biggest moment in Squid Game.

993
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,120
I helped.

994
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,640
We did it.

995
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,360
It's just shy of a miracle.

996
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,280
[all] Gganbu gang!

997
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,360
-Whoo!
-Let's go! [laughs]

998
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,480
[Rick] Lock it in.

999
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,120
[Stephen] All my trust was in Rick.
He is a dang hero.

1000
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,240
I mean, we had a strong bond before,
but after all this, I--

1001
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,840
I trust him with my life at this point.

1002
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,520
[players cheering]

1003
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,240

[cheering and applauding]

1005
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,280
Just waiting to see that door open

1006
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,760
and crossing my fingers
and hoping it's Figgy.

1007
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,160
[man 1] Oh!

1008
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,600
-[man 2] Yeah!
-[cheering]

1009
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,760
Like, "Where's Figgy? Where's Figgy?"

1010
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,800
And, uh, there's no Figgy.

1011
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,880
[tender melancholic music plays]

1012
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,440
And that-- It sucks.

1013
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,440
-I'm, like, really sad about Figgy.
-[Leann] I know.

1014
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,040
You know, we-- we want
those numbers to go down,

1015
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,240
but we forget…

1016
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,080
why they're going down.

1017
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,680
They're going down
because our friends are leaving.

1018
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,720
It's not gonna get any easier.

1019
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,520
[buzzer sounds on speakers]

1020
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,080

[creepy choral music plays]

1022
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,400
Oh no.

1023
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:45,560
[254] Show me the money. [chuckles]

1024

[musical swell plays and rises]

1025
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,000
Attention, players.

1026
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,120
We can now reveal
the results of the third game.

[man] Oh, shit!

1031
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,480
Oh my God.

1032
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,640
Wow, seeing it all like that.
That's not a lot of people.

1033
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:24,720
Let's go. Let's go!

1034
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,560
[players cheer and whoop]

1035
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,000
[Leann] I'm looking up
and seeing so much money.

1036
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,560
It's-- It's well past the halfway point.

1037
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,920
And then the people left in the game,
it's really so few people.

1038
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,640
[cheering continues]

1039

and we are still here.

[all cheer]

1043
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,360
[Brad] It does feel good
just to… kick back,

1044
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,280
and relax.

-[man] Oh, get away from that thing.
-It looks like an ATM.

1049
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,760
[man] It's a video game.

1050
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,200
[woman 1] Oh no.
I wanna be sick. I don't like that.

1051

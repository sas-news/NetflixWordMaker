I would be in a severe disadvantage
if we did something involving throwing

No. Because we all know
how the strategy games work.

No, because you've not mentioned this.
You've not indicated at any point.

-And you know that.
-Tim, we're not friends.

-Tim, that's really icky.

You started talking to me,
and you just went like that automatically.

I was like, "Oh, she signs."
At no point have you done that.

-No, Tim.
-You've done that for this moment.

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,680
Now I'm gonna beat your ass.

-Good luck with that.

There's no way you're taking this off me.

176
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,200
That's so messed up, bro.

177
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,480
I don't wanna battle it out
with you though.

178
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,600
One marble, closest to the wall wins?

179
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,280
-Yeah.
-So we're gonna shoot to the step.

180
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,320
Put all marbles out. One shot.

181
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,679
Closest takes it all.

182
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,080
-Sounds good.
-We're just gonna let the clock wind down?

183
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,760
Let it run all the way out,
leave 20, 30 seconds left.

184
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,799
-Okay.
-Boom.

185
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,919
One shot. Winner takes all.

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,600
-Deal. Yeah.
-All right.

187
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,600
[Brad] You wanna just dig the hole,
see how many we can get in the hole?

188
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,840
-Toss, then whoever gets the most in wins.
-Toss. The most in, wins.

189
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,800
[both] Oh!

190
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,840
[inhales sharply] All right.

191
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,840
Coming up.

192
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,120
Okay.

193
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,080
[Chaney] I have complete tunnel vision.

194
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,600
I'm only focused on myself,
and I'm only focused on the marble.

195
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,480
-[221] Ow.
-[Chaney] Damn.

You can pick the game, but I really don't
wanna do a game of throwing.

204
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,360
I'm not gonna do anything
besides a game of throwing.

205
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,720
Only gonna do a game of throwing?

206
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,120
Yep. I'll go-- I'll go
any game of throwing you want

207
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,160
-that involves more than one marble--
-I'm not comfortable playing throwing.

208
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,840
Don't have to raise your voice,
it's fine.

209
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
I'm not raising my voice.

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,800
You-- It's okay. Listen.
I thought you were a competitor.

211
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,760
I am a competitor.
That's why I'm not gonna fold.

212
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,680
Clearly not.

[Dylan sniffs]

214
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,160
Why are you being so stubborn?

215
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,160
I'm giving myself a chance to win,
as you should.

[Brad] Oh my gosh, this is so difficult.

240
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,560
[Jada] This is crazy.
Should we wait a little bit?

241
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,440
[Mai] Okay, let's wait.

242
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,240
[Jada] There's just
a lot of pressure on this game.

243
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,280
Um, you know, I had to go
through crazy tribulations, so…

244
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,720
Happy that I got this far… [clicks tongue]

245
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,520
…um, but one of the biggest things
I think I would do with the money

246
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,040
is, um, put some of the money
towards, like, a kidney donation center

247
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,120
'cause I donated my kidney
this time last year to my brother.

248
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,120
[clicks tongue] Um, I know
that this would really…

249
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,800
move my family, finally, in the direction
that we deserve to go

250
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,640
'cause we don't deserve
to continue to be in a cycle of pain

251
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,360
and going through
all the struggles that we have.

Of all the things that life throw at you.

Uh, I've been down
to the bottom of the pit.

or being a single parent at 19.

And, uh--

259
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,840

Because I have nobody.

I proposed so many compromises!

I'm trying to compromise.

That's two points as well.

323
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,560
[Leann] But the drive to compete
is just sometimes too strong

324

-I think that's in.

[Leann] What's it gonna mean to him
if I let him win?

328

I'm-- I'm not just gonna give you the win.

[sighs heavily]

523
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,840
[Mikie] Games aren't supposed to suck.

Goddamn. [chuckles sadly]

[Phalisia sighs]

530
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,240
-I love you.
-I love you too.

[sniffles] You got a bitch crying.

535
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,040
Yeah. Just make me proud.

536
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,080
I will.

537
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,600
[Ashley] You know,
wins are supposed to feel good.

538
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,040
[sobs]

539
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,200
[Ashley] That felt like a loss.

I'm sorry you beat me.

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,800
I'm sorry I beat you too.

545
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,520
Ah.

546
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,320
Dad is gonna be really proud of you.

547
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,720
[Trey sobs] I know.

548
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,160
[Leann] He really is.

549
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,440
He told you to play honorably,
and you have, every step of the way.

550
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,560
-I'm so glad I played with you.
-[chuckles] Me too.

[Trey whimpers and breathes deeply]

553
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,000
Goodbye.

-[players exclaiming]
-Oh my God.

561
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,400
-Wow!
-Oh my gosh.

562
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,440
[Trey] Going back into the dorm
and not having someone

563
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,480
that you know you can trust,
you know is gonna be there for you…

564
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,320
Like… that person is gone.

565
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,080
I think I had an advantage,
uh, having my mom here.

566
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,840
And now I think
the playing field is really leveled,

567
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,880
and I have to figure out, like,
"How do I move forward without her here?"

568
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,240
-[TJ sighs]
-Good to see you, man.

569
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,480
How hard was it, man?

570
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,840
-It was really hard. It was really tough.
-Yeah.

571
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,640
Yeah. I-- I get it.

572
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,160
But, you know, just know that,
you know, we here now.

573
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,360
-Yeah.
-The-- The moment's here now.

574
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,800
-Yeah.
-Let's get it.

575
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,640
-Let's get it. Let's get it, dude.
-[laughs]

576
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,080
Let's get it. Ugh, Jesus.

577
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,560
[Trey] I'm worried that losing her

578
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,640
puts the spotlight
a little bit more on me,

579
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,320
and I don't need any more spotlight.
Like, I don't want a target on my back.

580
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,480
[451 sniffling]

581
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,040
I'm glad to see you guys.

582
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,360
Glad to see you too.

583
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,960
-[Jordan] Uh, I skipped the game.
-[all laugh]

584
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,000
Give me a hug, bro.
I've been here the whole time.

585
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,480
[451 laughs]

586
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,240
-Sorry, dude.
-[sniffles] That sucked.

587
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,280
Sorry, dude.

588
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,280
[451] If I'm being honest,
I don't feel good.

589
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,520
I feel like I just betrayed
a friend of mine

590
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,720
to bring myself closer to a prize.

591
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,920
But my strategy in this game,
and also throughout a lot of this,

592
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,280
has just been to keep my hopes up high
and my head down low,

593
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,560
knowing that anything could happen
and it's not worth worrying about.

594
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,320
[TJ] 'Cause, like, we're mourning.

595
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,280
-[Mai] Yeah, it was hard for me. Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

596
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,520
[TJ] You know I love you?

597
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,000
-Yeah.
-Mmm.

598
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:43,200
-I'm glad that you here. I'm here.
-Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

599
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,640
[TJ inhales sharply]

600
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,240
Damn.

601
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,240
Mai, 287, is wise, super wise, and-- and…

602
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,640
genuinely cares about people.

603
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,240
There's an age gap between us.

604
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,360
However, I see her in me,

605
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,880
and she sees me in her.

606
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,320
[tense music plays]

607
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,320

00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,120
I'm so happy I'm here!

609
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
Yes! I'm so happy you're here too.

610
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,320
-Bad bitches here.
-[Phill] Yes!

611
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,880
Wait. Bad bitches here?

612
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,720
[Jackie and Phill] Bad bitches here.

613
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,040
[Jackie] Bad bitches here.
Bad bitches here.

614
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,160
After that game,
I feel more distrustful than ever.

615
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,360
But I feel like
I can trust Phill completely.

616
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,000
That's my person in here now.

617
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,360
[Phill] Ooh! Go, Jackie! Go, Jackie!

618
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,080
President of the Bad--

619
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,960
Wait. Bad Bitch Club.

620
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,080

-[Bee] Oh my God.
-[man] No way. No way.

624
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,920
[Ashley] Man, leave us alone.

[woman] I'm so scared.

[square guard] Attention, players.

629
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,360
Here are the results of the fourth game.

[Rose] Oh my God. I can't believe this.

633
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,680
Thirty-two players were eliminated.

634
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,400
-[man] Damn!
-[Rose] Oh!

Let's go.

639
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,720
[Ashley] Jeez Louise.

640
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,280
Whoa, whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh! Whoo-whoo!

641
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,600
-Oh my God.
-That's damn near full!

642
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,480
[various players] Oh my God.

643
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,760
[players cheering]

644
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,800
-Almost there! [laughing] Oh my God.
-That money, girl.

645
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,960
-[355] I can't even think about that.
-Four-point-two! Oh my God.

646
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,960
[355] The money's becoming more real,

647
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,960
and I thought the real game
was gonna be the challenges,

648
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,600
but I think the real game
is figuring out what's going on

649
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,680
in every other player's head right now.

650
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,240
[077 exhales sharply]

651
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,000
Wow. Just us, bud.

652
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,800
The current prize fund
now stands at $4,250,000.

653
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,120
-[various players] Wow.
-[man] What the heck?!

654
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,760
My mom's up there.

655
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,720
My mom's up there, guys.

656
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,640
[Rose] Oh my God.

657
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,560
[Roland] Wow.

658
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,480
[pulsing synthesizer music plays]

659
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,560
[016] Unbelievable.

660
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,400
That was the hardest victory
of the day, easy. Easy!

661
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,360
-And the most deserved.
-Yeah.

662
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,320
You try and stay two steps ahead,
and the game is 400 steps ahead,

663
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,000
but you do what you can
to control what you can,

664
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,960
and this is the most stressful situation
I've ever been in.

665
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,200
-[Dan] It's gonna be dead in here now.
-[031] 50% gone. Boom, just like that.

666
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,600
We have to, uh, re-- redistribute
our-- our team here, right?

667
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,960
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-This is-- Who's left? Just us, right?

668
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,920
-Well, n--
-Who--

669
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,960
-Marcus is gone. Brian's gone.
-Yeah.

670
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,760
Gonna be awfully quiet
in here tonight, baby.

671
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,760
Wow. Let's see what's next.

672
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,320
-Real gganbu gang there, man.
-Yeah, baby!

673
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,800
[laughs]

674
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,200
[Dan] I need to make it through each day.

675
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,800
Not-- I'm not worried about what's next,
what's down the road.

676
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,960
I'm worried about getting
through every single day, one at a time.

677
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,400
I'm here to win.

678
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,240
And I'm here to take home
that giant, big-ass piggy bank.

679
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,520
That's why I'm here.

680
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,320
Who's, uh-- Who's Chad's top-- top three,
and who's the dark horse?

681
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,440
[Chad] Oh yeah.

682
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,560
Honestly, I-- I'd-- I would bet on Mai.

683
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,680
-To win?
-Yeah. She is so mentally tough.

684
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,880
-Dark horse.
-[Chad] Yeah.

685
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,240
-You're saying clear favorite, like--
-Clear favorite.

686
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,440
-Yeah.
-[090] Right.

687
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,640
[ominous music plays]

688
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,120
I was born in Vietnam,

689
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,200
and I left during
the fall of Vietnam in 1975.

690
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,360
I was eight years old.

691
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,640
And I can remember that, you know,

692
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,720
going to the airfield
where everybody, you know,

693
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:13,040
all the, um, refugees are laying on the--

694
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,560
uh, laying down on the airfield.

695
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,760
And being eight years old,
I was, like, curious,

696
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,560
so I-- I had, you know, my head up.

697
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,400
You know, trying to see
where's the bombing coming from,

698
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,360
or where the guns,
you know, were shooting at.

699
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,520
And so I-- I just,
a split second, I lift my head up.

700
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,200
A soldier automatically, so quick,

701
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,520
put the-- the gun, you know, to my temple.

702
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,920
And he was about to shoot me

703
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,200
because, you know,
he thought I was a threat.

704
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:46,000
So my mother yanked me
so hard to the ground.

705
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,800
And in that split second,
my life was, like, almost over.

706
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,720
That is a moment
where I would never, never forget.

707
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:58,840
[sobs] And that moment is like, you know,
a driving moment for me to be strong.

just that-- to know that my trial

is, like, with me,

I guarantee you
nobody wanted to be the captain

750
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,920
[Chad] I was taking a nap. I'm waking up,

751
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,200
and I'm learning that we
"unanimously" voted 182 as captain.

752
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,480
He's not my captain.

753
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,440
He's not my leader.
I thought we should have had a discussion

754
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,920
because there are
much better leaders out there.

755
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,120
I don't have faith in him.
He could take me out at any second.

756
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,000
Attack the moment.
That's it, that's all you can do.

757
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,440
That's it, literally. That's all you got.

770
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,880

as great as the leader does

772
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,360
So, um, my whole mantra
is "Attack the moment."

00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,680
'Cause that's all we got, is the moment.

00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,000
Right.

So let's-- let's come together
and just pray, y'all. Like, for real.

00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,320
Like, just a quick-- a quick prayer.

And-- And peace
is not unattainable, y'all.

So let's do this. Let's do this.

00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,160
Head down, y'all. Please, head down. Um…

797

[Amanda] I think
when people first meet me,

798

they always think, "Oh, she's a bimbo."

And when I tell people I was
a weapon engineer in the Royal Navy,

801
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,960
they're like, "What? Really?"

00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,480
And I'm like, "Yeah, why not?
Why wouldn't I be?"

803
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,280
I turned up one day
with a pink suitcase and a glitter dress,

804
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,480
and they actually bet
that I wouldn't last longer than a week,

805
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,000
and I ended up in charge.

806
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,440
It wasn't something
I went out actively looking for, or to do.

807

It was just, I think,
a part of my personality.

I respect people,

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,320

for what's right and wrong,

led people to much greater things.

826
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,200
I have. And-- And the thing is,
it's, like, because they trusted me.

827
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,920
-Well done for stepping up, bro.
-Thank you, thank you, thank you.

828

-What up?

830
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,760
[Mai] So…

831
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,680
What's up?

832
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,080
-I don't trust TJ.
-Oh no. Not at all.

833
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,040
[Mai] 'Cause his clique is still here.

834
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,240
-[Chad] I don't trust him at all.
-No.

835
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,760
He said he got a pure heart.
I don't think he got a pure heart.

836
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,680
-Nope.
-No.

837
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,240
TJ, he's an entertainer.
So, uh, in my mind, being an entertainer,

838
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,080
they project a character that,
you know, people want to see.

839
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,440
Chin up. I'm gonna tell everybody,
put they chin up and be strong.

840
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,200
No heart, no glory. No pain, no fear.

841
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,720
100%.

842
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,480
But captains el-- get eliminated.

843
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,080
Yeah, they sure do.

844
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,640
[Dan] 286, 287, they are not satisfied

845
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:00,320
and are not at all in love
with the way 182 is talking to everyone.

846
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,080
So now is my time
to seize their dislike for him,

847
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,080
use it to my advantage,

848
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,800
then we can make our move
no matter what is coming next.

849
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,440
[TJ] Get y'all mind right.
Get y'all mind right.

850
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,400
[Dan] He's gotta be
the biggest target right now.

851
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,000
-[Chad] 100%. Yep, yep, yep.
-Right?

852
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,480
-100%. TJ's getting nervous.
-[Dan] He sure is.

853
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,800
Not that you can tell
because he's always talking.

854
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,720
[Chad] Yeah.

855
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,880
I think there could be votes,
there could be anything.

856
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,080
So we just gotta make sure--

857
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,920
Yeah, we gotta get-- make sure
we have a couple of votes, right?

858
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,440
Yeah, we're good. Um…

859
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,760
I have enough people in--
in every group that we're looking at--

860
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,800
If you need another one,

861
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,520
If you need another one,
I'm with you guys.

862
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,240
-I don't know anybody else.
-No, no, you're with us, but-- but--

863
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,680
-You know, s-- Yeah.
-Yeah, I'll stay in the periphery.

864
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,720
We just look out for each other
like we have been.

865
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,200
Just keep playing the game.
Under the radar. No BS. We're good.

866
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,600
-We shouldn't talk too long.
-No.

867
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,440
-I'll go mingle. All right?
-Yeah. Good call.

868
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,840
I think I have a-- a real good
bullshit-ometer, I can tell you that.

869
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,560
[sniffs] Um, there are many tells
when people are not confident.

870
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,840
Uh, everybody has a different one,

871
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,520
but I think part of being a good leader

872
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,040
is letting people talk,

873
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,480
not always talking yourself.

874
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,520
Listen more than you talk.

875
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,960
Get information.

876
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,360
That's how you can tell
how people operate,

877
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,080
that's how you can-- you can predict

878
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,760
what someone is going to do.

879
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,840
By how they talk,
how they act, their mannerisms.

880
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,960
And, um, in this game,
being able to have any certainty

881
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,560
of what someone may or may not do,

882
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,840
that's a huge advantage.

883
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,920
[musical swell plays]

884
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
[players chattering indistinctly]

885
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,000
[Marina] I think a lot of people
underestimated us girls.

886
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,680
Strength in numbers at this point.
There's only nine of us.

887
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,000
I think we all should deserve
to make it through.

888
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,120
Because, unfortunately--

889
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,400
[Amanda] We do, yeah.
'Cause women need to stick together

890
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,440
because otherwise,
you're-- we're easier to pick off.

891
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,560
[Bee] I agree.

892
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,040
-I have every lady's back in here.
-It's girl power, man.

893
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,920
The only way I think women
should be going out from now on

894
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,480
is because they lose to a challenge.

895
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,960
So we have the opportunity
to prove that we are worthy.

896
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,880
Yeah.

897
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,040
Because they're making
the assumption that we're not.

898
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,960
[Marina] Yeah.

899
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:16,360
[355] Knowing that there's nine women
and 22 men is a scary thought,

900
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,440
and I'm willing to go to bat
for any one of these women right now.

901
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,080
Us girls need to be on one single page.

902
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,440
-Yeah.
-[Amanda] On the same page.

903
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,200
-And don't break it.
-[Bee] Nope.

904
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,800
Because it won't work out otherwise,
I don't think.

905
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,560
[Bee] 'Cause they can't get rid
of all of us. One of us has to win.

906
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,200
[Marina] Us girls, as a unit,
we can do-- we can do a lot of damage,

907
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,920
and now's the time
to make a move and stick together.

908
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,320
And if we do, we-- we can--
we can make a splash.

909
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,240
[Marina] Here comes Mai.

910
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,680
-[Hallie] Another lady.
-[Amanda] Here she is. Come on, Mai.

911
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,440
[Mai] We never have any ladies' group.

912
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,720
-[Bee] Come to the ladies.
-[Amanda] It's what we want.

913
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,880
[Mai] I see the females together,
and I'm thinking if there is a vote

914
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,360
or if there's a test
to vote, you know, each other out,

915
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,360
it would be to my advantage
to, you know, form an alliance.

916
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,320
Ashley!

917
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,400
Come to the female group.

918
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,640
-[Mai] Woman power!
-[Hallie] Rose!

919
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,120
-Rose.
-Okay.

920
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,640
[Amanda] The one shot we've got
is to pull the women together.

921
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,320
I'll rely on you, and you rely on me.

922
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,040
'Cause if 22 men get through,
they're gonna vote us out.

923
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,080
-[Amanda] Jackie.
-[Mai] Jackie!

924
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,240
Jackie, come!

925
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,760
[Amanda] Can I just say
this is the first time all us girls

926
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,400
have been together on our own without men.

927
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,400
[Ashley] It's nine women left
in the competition. Isn't that crazy?

928
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,920
[Amanda] So no women are going today,
and we stand our ground.

929
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,440
Hands down.

930
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,360
[Marina laughs]

931
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,720
[Jackie] I agree completely.
We need to stick together.

932
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,520
But at the same time,

933
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,240
I have that thing in the back of my head.

934
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,600
Can I trust the women? I don't know.

935
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,360
[creepy choral music plays]

936
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,400
[buzzer plays on speakers]

937
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,280
-[Bee] No! Oh.
-[TJ] Let's do it, y'all!

938
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,520
-[Bee] No.
-[man 1] This is it.

939
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,720
[woman] I hate this.

940
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,280
-No!
-[023] Shh.

941
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,720
[man 2] I don't want this.

942
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,720
[man 3] Can the game be

943
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,000
whoever throws up the first wins?
'Cause I'm feeling like doing that now.

944
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
[Ashley] Oh Lord.

945
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,600
-[Jackie] Here we go.
-Here we go.

946
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,960
[Marina] It's time.

947
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,560
[knuckles crack]

948
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,320
[square guard] Players,
the test is about to begin.

949
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,760
Player 182,
please stand on the ramp to my right.

950
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,360
You have been building relationships
during your time here,

951
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,040
and now you will be responsible
for each other's fate.

952
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,600
-[man 1 whispers] Oh God.
-[gasps]

953
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,360
[square guard] Only 20 players
will pass to the next game.

954
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,000
[man 2] You're kidding.

955
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,320
[softly] Wow.

956
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,480
[Bee] We're hoping this is the moment
for the women to stick together.

957
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,320
It's super tense because a plan is only
as good as the opportunity to apply it.

958
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,160
So we are really nervous.

959
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,400
[exhales slowly]

960
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,360

[square guard] Player 182.

962
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,600
As captain, you will automatically
pass to the next game.

963
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,560
[softly] Wow.

964
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,600
[Trey] Getting an advantage publicly

965
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,200
is almost like a disadvantage
at this point.

966
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,000
Like, that's-- that's a scary thing,

967
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,200
and, like, that-- that's a target
on your back for sure.

968
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,120
[square guard] Now you will show
where your true allegiances lie.

969
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,880
Please pick one ally
to save from elimination

970
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,920
and join you in the next game.

971
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,920
The 11 players not picked
at the end of this test of allegiance

972
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,960
will be eliminated.

[serene music plays]

978
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,680
I pick player 287.

[sobs]

980
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,280
[light applause]

981
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,840
Go on, Mai.

982
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,480
[sobs]

983
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,640
[Dan] Earlier in the day,
I-- I heard her talking

984
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,200
about how much she could not stand him,

985
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,040
and he freaking picks her.

986
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,360
[softly] Thank you.

987
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,520
Un-freakin-believable.

988
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,760
[square guard] Player 287,

989
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:38,000
please pick one ally
to join you in the next game.

990
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,400
[brooding pulsing music plays]

991
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,440
You know what to do, Mai.

992
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,520
[Amanda] This is it! This is the moment.

993
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,880
Us women, we're gonna stick together.

994
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,400
We know our mission. We know what to do.

995
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,480
If everyone plays the part,
we should all get through.

996
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,400
[Marina] It's time to get the ball moving.

997
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,760
I know she's gonna follow through
on what she says,

998
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,840
and I know
she's gonna pick one of the girls.

999
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,200
[Mai] I have no idea who I should pick.

1000
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,800
286, Chad, has my trust, loyalty.

1001
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,920
Or should I, you know,
support the females?

1002
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,920
It's just a very hard decision.

1003
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,720
[square guard] Player 287,
please pick one ally.

1004

[scattered applauding]

1008
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,280
Well done, Chad.

1009
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,760
She broke the chain.

1010
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,720
[Amanda] Don't agree to stick together
and then break it

1011
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,360
because you're showing me
I can't trust you.

1012
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,680
And you're not just showing me that,

1013
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,680
you're showing the other women in there.

1014

00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,800
[Dan] We made a deal.

1016
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,640
He said, "I got you."

1017
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,080
This person's story hit home with me,

1018
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,720
and I wanna make sure that they have
the opportunity to play the game.

1019
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,000
The player that I'd like
to join in the next game…

1020
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,040
is player two…

1021
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,480
five…

1022
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,160
[ominous tone plays]

1023
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,120
four.

1024
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,760
[Mikie] Thanks, brother.

1025
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,800
[Mikie sighs]

1026
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,960
["Winter - Op. 8 Concerto No. 4"
from Vivaldi's <i>Four Seasons </i>plays]

1027
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,520
[Mikie] The player I'm choosing

1028
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,400
has always been there for me
when I didn't have anybody else.

1029
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,440
Simple as that.

1030
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,360
Seventy-seven.

1031
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,800
[Marina] I didn't doubt you
for a minute. [sighs]

1032
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,240
-I love you.
-[Mikie whispers inaudibly]

1033
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,400
[Marina softly] Okay.

1034
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,840
[Marina] Now is the time to make a move.

1035
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,600
My pick is definitely
going to get the ball rolling.

1036
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,840
Player 018.

1037
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,320
-[applauding]
-[Bee] Oh gosh.

1038
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,040
Oh, thank you.

1039
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,720
[sighs] Thank you. Thank you so much.

1040
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,080
Player 019.

1041
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,640
[applauding]

1042
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,920
[Amanda] Come here, you.

1043
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,520
I feel like we need
to even out the numbers moving forward,

1044
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,000
and we've been
massively unnumbered as women.

1045
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,840
[Trey] All-girls alliance? Like, what?
Like, did I miss something?

1046
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,000
Player 393.

1047
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,840
[Bee] It's the first time I think
the men have felt threatened

1048
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,600
by the women in this whole competition.

1049
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,840
And it feels really good to have a moment

1050
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,680
and to be like,
"We can make our own alliances too."

1051
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,080
We can do what we want as well,

1052
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,360
and we have control
over this competition as well.

1053
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,240
[Dan] I'm running scenarios
through my head like an absolute madman.

1054
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,760
How many women are left…

1055
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,480
and how many spots are left?

1056
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,760
I'm trying to calculate
if I even have a chance right now.

1057
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,120
[Jackie, softly] Thank you.

1058
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,960
If I pick Phill
and tell him to pick a woman,

1059
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,440
do you think that'll be okay?

1060
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,960
It's up to you. It's your decision.

1061
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:01,920
[Jackie sighs]

1062
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,920
[sinister suspenseful music plays]

1063
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,920
[square guard] Player 393,

1064
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,440
please pick one ally
to join you in the next game.

1065
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,720
[Jackie] I know we had,
like, already spoken

1066
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,640
about putting the girls priority,

1067
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,600
but Phill has been
my closest friend in here,

1068
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,840
and picking someone else would be--

1069
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,560
It would be betrayal.

1070
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,360
I-- I don't know what to think.

1071
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,080
[music intensifies]

1072
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,680

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,720
Attention, all players.

343
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,360
Here are the results of the first game.

344
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,200

348
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,600
Oh!

349
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,160
Out of 456 players…

350
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,960
259 have been eliminated.

351
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,560

[cheering and applauding]

354
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,160
Bring it, baby. Bring it!

355
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,880
Bring it, baby!

356
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,840
[square guard] Every player eliminated
will add $10,000 to the prize fund.

357
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,000
[all cheering]

358
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,320
I'm here. I made it to the next round.

359
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,760
[laughs] The bank is growing,
the money is showing.

360

[rapturous classical music plays]

361
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,600
Wow, that's a lot! Damn!

362
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,080
[Stephen] Holy crap. It's so much money.

363
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,960
I don't come from old money.
I come from the-- the broke money!

364
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,240
I wanna help my family out,
I wanna support my girls

365
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
for the rest of their life financially.

366
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,560
It would b-be everything.

367
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,000
-[woman 1] Oh my God!
-[woman 2] That's a lot of money!

368
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,360
[woman 1] Yes!

369
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,040
Oh my Lord!

370
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,520
-[woman 3] It's still going!
-[woman 4] It is.

371
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,440
[square guard] The current total
stands at $2.59 million.

372
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,560
[woman 5] What?

373
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,360
[all cheer]

374
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,240
If they offered you-- If they offered you
100 right now, would you leave?

375
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,280
-$100 K?
-[Bryton] Yeah.

376
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,240
-Oh no. I've got to stay to the end.
-Thank you.

377
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,040
-I gotta stay to the end, bro.
-[laughs]

378
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,160
For me, everybody is just money.

379
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,560
One person gets eliminated,
it's another $10,000.

380
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,640
One-- Another person gets eliminated,
now it's $20,000.

381
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,600
I'm smiling.
I'm having a good time, but mentally,

382
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,520
I'm looking for any way to win.
I'm locked in.

383
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,520
This dormitory is where you'll live,

384
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,280
eat, and sleep.

385
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,120
You will be responsible for its upkeep.

386
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,600
Damn.

387
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,760
Between games, there will also be tests,

388
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,160
which will take place in the dormitory.

389
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,040
[man 002] What?

390
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,840
These are tests of character.

391
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,560
How you play is who you are.

392
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
During these tests,

393
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,600
you may have the opportunity
to give other players an advantage

394
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,960
to help them in the game.

395
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,760
[players chattering]

396
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,920
But be aware,
these tests may also be the opportunity

397
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,360
to eliminate other players.

398
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,840
[all exclaim]

399
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,800
[pulsing music plays]

400
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,760
This is getting serious. Whoo!

401
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,680
[Trey] This is social now.

402
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,600
That is-- That is a social game
if I've ever heard one.

403
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,760
Tests. If one person has the power
to eliminate another person,

404
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,480
that changes this entire game.

405
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,640
I just-- I-I-- What tests?

406
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,040
[man 270] I'm excited for the tests.

407
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,800
For example, right now, let's say
they gave you the power to, like,

408
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,720
you need to choose one person
and eliminate them.

409
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,120
I'd have to go to somebody
who I-- who I haven't met.

410
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,440
-I would hate that, man.
-Yeah, but that's harsh though.

411
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,800
You'd have to choose
a random person. There's no way.

412
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,640
-But-- But that's not fair.
-Yeah.

413
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,680
That is not fair.

414
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,240
[woman 302] I'd have no problem.
I'd eliminate somebody.

415
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,200
-Do you have an idea?
-Who I would?

416
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,360
-[clicks tongue] Oh, good question. Uh…
-[Trey laughs]

417
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,400
I'm gonna say one of the bros.

418
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,800
-I mean, what is this?
-That's wide.

419
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,320
-Well, it's--
-Wide. Do-- Do this one.

420
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,280
-Let's do normal push-ups, man. Come on.
-Show me a normal one.

421
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,080
A push-up is like this. Look up.

422
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,840
You gonna tell me what a push-up is,
or you gonna come do 'em with me?

423
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,400
-Get your old ass down here.
-Look up.

424
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,680
-Get your old ass down here!
-Look up, my boy.

425
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,920
He's a bro.

426
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,360
[both laugh]

427
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,760
There is a group of guys
I am now calling "the bros."

428
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,200
'Cause they kind of all hang together.

429
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,440
They're just always,
like, strutting around.

430
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,600
"Show how big and strong I am."

431
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,440
But I think it's so important
to be careful about thinking as a group.

432
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,960
It just puts a target on people's backs.

433
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,400
We can do dips.

434
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,200
-Oh, you can do dips on a bench?
-You wanna do dips? Come on, come on.

435
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,840
[Trey] This is Squid Game,

436
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,320
and in dorm room,
the game starts to get really real.

437
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,960
You start thinking about, like,
"Oh, who am I sleeping next to?"

438
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,040
"Who do I want to talk to?"

439
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,080
You start, like, seeing people
that are together a lot.

440
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,320
[Bryton grunts]

441
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,720
Do I really need you to count for me?

442
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,040
[Trey] 432 is creating this boys' club

443
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,760
and judging people
based on their appearance.

444
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,360
And you know, that is a dangerous game.

445
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,480
Oh yeah, there's the pump.

446
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,520
That's the pump.

447
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,880
I'm not cocky in the slightest.

448
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,160
I don't think I'm better
than one person on this Earth.

449
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,400
My personality is very confident.

450
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,520
It's very outgoing.

451
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,760
It-- It's-- It's almost selfish

452
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,000
because I love myself so much.

453
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,560
I know who I am.
I know God made me this way.

454
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,560
He didn't make me another way.

455
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,080
Why-- Why-- Why would I want
to be something else?

456
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,000
Like,

457
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,240
it-- it-- it doesn't--

458
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,560
it doesn't make sense to me sometimes,
when people--

459
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,760
when people are like, "Life is so unfair."

460
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,640
It-- It's fair.

461
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,760
Because the same shit that happened to you

462
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,200
is the-- is the same shit
that happened to me.

463
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,560
I'm-- I'm just not complaining about it.

464
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,280
[automated voice]
<i>Players, it's now time for chores.</i>

465

466
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,600
[Kyle] <i>Okay.</i>
<i>Oh, we're about to chop up some food.</i>

467
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,480
[man 099] <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

468
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,080
That's where this is gonna come in handy.

469
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,200
[woman] Oh, God. Have I ever
done this before? [laughs]

470
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,560
You know, I'm--
I'm really good with potato peeling,

471
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,680
with something like this,
but not this… quite this shape.

472
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,640
[woman laughs]

473
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,480
-My name's Dani. What's yours?
-Oh, Kyle.

474
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,720
-Nice to meet you. Yes.
-Kyle?

475
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,560
-Where are you from, Kyle?
-I'm from Kentucky.

476
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,640
-Kentucky? Okay, I hear the accent.
-Yep.

477
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,680
How are you finding your time here?

478
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,960
-Were you nervous about coming?
-Yeah.

479
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,280
I mean, I wasn't nervous
about, like, the social part.

480
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,720
-I'm just nervous about the challenges.
-Oh, really?

481
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,640
And, esp-- Well, especially
after Red Light, Green Light, like, how--

482
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,800
-How much pressure that was.
-Yeah.

483
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,760
I struggled right at the end.
I mean, I was about to give up, I thought.

484
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,760
-Do you think?
-But I mentally held down.

485
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,720
I mean, had to.

486
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,200
I will say that, no matter what,
the mullet, the redneck,

487
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,120
uh, the country accent,

488
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,880
um, in my opinion, is always viewed

489
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,440
as maybe a little bit more
less intelligent

490
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,720
than, uh, possibly, you know,

491
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,240
other northern or-- or even western
of Kentucky kind of states.

492
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,680
Um, I can, uh--

493
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,000
I can almost see it sometimes
in people's faces with my accent.

494
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,400
They're almost like, "Yeah,
this guy's probably not that smart."

495
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,480
But yeah, I can definitely play
off that anytime I-- I like

496
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,480
to, you know, get an advantage.

497
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,160
If I see the opportunity,
I-- I'm gonna seize it.

498
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,520
[Dani] Am I doing this wrong?

499
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,280
-[chuckles] With potatoes--
-Oh, there we go!

500
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,240
-Did you get the edge?
-I got it. Okay, I get it.

501
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,840
I was gonna say,
with potatoes, the edge kind of…

This is insanity, actually.

510
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,400
Do we send someone home?

511
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,360
-Who would we help?
-Yeah.

512
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,640
'Cause obviously you'd help someone
that you think likes you, right?

513
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,040
You want to give them
an extra leg in the game

514
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,440
to see if they would help you.

515
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,560
But do you think in the end
they're extending a hand back?

516
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,360
You think they really'd grab your hand
when it comes to the challenge?

517
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,800
And what are you gonna get?
A "Thank you so much"?

518
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,680
-Right--
-That might be about it.

519
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,320
…if it was you two at the end,
they'd still stab you in the back.

520
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,240
-Still would--
-That's the nature of the game.

521
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,800
-I would do that. So--
-Yes! Four and a half million dollars?

522
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,800
-What the…?
-It's smarter to eliminate.

523
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,880
-I think it is too.
-It's $10,000.

524

-One person is $10,000 closer…
-Mm-hmm.

-God, I'm trying to think numbers now.

That's brutal.

532

I don't know. Think about
what they're thinking in their heads.

533
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,480
They got double the chance
of splitting that money with each other.

534
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,400
Me and you ain't gonna split that money.
Mom and son definitely is.

-Oh, 100%. And that scares me.
-Okay.

What about any of the big guys?
Like, the big, big guys?

539
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,360
That one dude, player 432,
he's-- he's already grouping up.

540
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,080
Seems like a ringleader,

it's, like, Italian food.

it's not a meal,

and I think I 100% need food,
otherwise, I just can't really think.

So, for me, it's a priority.

we're not here to-- to play fair.

We're here to play a game,

even put the other one, though?

-No, you're lying.

-No! He just came from down--
-What? What?

598
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,200
He just came from down his bunk
and opened a second one.

599
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,760
[Jada] I would never do that
to someone in here. Am I tweaking?

[woman 095] No, you're not.

of food, like…

Like, whatever. But…

What the hell you be doing outside
if this is how you're acting here?

605
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,880
[man] All right,
we've got to keep our wits around us.

606
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,920
And he's eating so fast, you can't tell.

607
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,800
And he's too jolly for me. Mm-mmm.

608
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,040
-Uh, don't throw anything away, please.
-You want it?

609
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,480
-Yeah. Are you sure?
-Yeah.

610
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,760
-Like, 100%?
-Yeah. Do you-- I didn't use the spoon.

00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,960
Oh, thanks. No, I don't care.

So, I work in private equity.
I'm an asset manager.

00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,920
Uh, I thought that was gonna be
my career path.

619
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,199
But now, I feel after the pandemic,
the dream is completely shattered,

620
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,600
and now I'm just attracted
to creative stuff.

621
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,320
I actually think--

622
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,800
I don't believe in the values
of the corporate world anymore.

623
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,400
There's no rules.
Like, break free from everything.

"You shouldn't do this or that,"

everything is gonna be gone.

on the whole test thing.

630
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,080
I just wanna know, like, is it anonymous?

631
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,200
It's just so-- I don't like secrets.

632
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,120
Yeah.

633
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,960
I just don't believe
that all of these people,

634
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,560
if given the opportunity,

635
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,600
would not eliminate somebody anonymously.

-I--
-Everybody's acting that case.

00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,720

301 or 302. You gotta break 'em up.

181
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,600
They're mother-son,
you have to break them up

182
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,080

[man 1] Oh, bro. That's a power move.

193
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,000
This is terrible.

194
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,960
[Leann] Sorry, Steve.

195
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,400
-That's ridiculous.
-[016] Gonna miss you, bro.

196
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,720
[Stephen] This freakin' sucks.

197
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,440
I didn't even know
she for real knew who I was.

198
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,880
I thought I was doing a good job
staying out of the spotlight.

199
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,720
I'm… floored.
My heart is in my shoe right now.

200
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
I don't know. This just sucks.

[melancholic music plays]

214
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,480

-[softly] I don't know. I don't know.

215
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,760
-[man 1] So sorry, Dr. Rick.
-[269] Rick, we love you.

-[Leann] We'll see you soon.
-[man 2] I'll see you.

00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,880
Yeah, I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.

218
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,160
[Rick] Being eliminated this way
is-- is extremely disappointing.

219
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,160
It felt so good to be part of a gang.

220
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840
My gang. The gganbu gang.

221
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,840
I really felt like I'm protected,

[somber guitar music plays]

228
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,080
That was a close shot there.

229

-I was nervous for you.
-[Trey] I know.

230
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,320
[Trey] I-- I thought
I was a goner for sure.

231
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,920
The fewer people are in the game,
the more power an unbreakable duo has,

232
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,160
and the bigger target
is gonna be on our back.

233
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,760
Bitch, you made me cry.

234
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,720
-I hate you.
-[Phalisia laughs weakly]

235
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,920
[Ashley] Oh, God.

236
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,920
[Brad] Yeah, she bad.
She did that like a boss, bro.

237
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,040
Like a boss.

238
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,880
[Leann] You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

239
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,800
That was strategic,
that was not emotional,

240
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,000
and I respect you for that.

241
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,440
And you helped the rest of us out.

242
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,000
That was a boss bitch move.
Boss bitch move.

243
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,120
[Jada] Player 229, she really, like,
gave me another sense of motivation.

244
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,320
Like, wow, that is some balls.

245
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,280
I'm sure that was
a really hard decision to make.

246
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,080
-I know that was your friend.
-No, it's okay.

247
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,440
He was a sweet man, but I know
that was hard for you too. It's okay.

248
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,480
[Phalisia] I don't regret
any decisions I have made.

249
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,400
This has now evened the playing field.

250
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,800
So I don't care what kind of hate
or targets I have right now.

251
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,360
I think majority of people will be…

252
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,240
thankful that I did what I did.

253
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,720
The gganbu gang
is absolutely rocked right now.

254
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,840
The strategy is to regroup,
pivot, redirect,

255
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,720
and to not panic. Definitely don't panic.

256
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,840
All right, so listen. Let's talk
about what the hell just happened.

257
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,360
-Nobody's in here, right?
-[334] Nobody's in here.

258
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,600
-So, we obviously lost our wisdom.
-[334] Yep, he's gone.

259
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,360
-[Dan] We lost Quadzilla.
-[334] Yeah.

260
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,920
Um, anybody have any ideas,
you think, what happened?

261
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,920
I think-- I think we're too visible.

262
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,120
Everybody knows
we're the strongest team, right?

263
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,920
-So we should be less visible as well.
-[Dan] I agree, that's smart.

264
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,120
-That girl made a savage, brutal move.
-[334] Yeah.

265
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,800
But it-- it was a move
that I woulda made.

266
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,800
Taking the kid out with the advantage
was also a great move,

267
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,720
but now we know that she's a player.

268
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,320
So my advice, we don't talk
to anybody else about anything.

269
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,480
It's a dumb saying, but loose lips,
dude, they're gonna sink our ship.

270
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,040
-I know, literally, yeah.
-Right, so-- Yeah.

271
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,160
-Listen. Quietly, quietly.
-[031] Yeah. Ggan--

272
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,000
[all whisper] Gganbu gang.

273
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,080
Yeah.

274
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,440
-That's good, that's good. That's good.
-Yeah.

275
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,440
-[Dan] Come on. After you.
-[334] Thank you.

276
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,240
Live to see another day.

277
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,440
-That was--
-Ten percent of people gone.

278
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,960
Phalisia kept looking at me.

279
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,920
I thought we were toast there
for a second.

280
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,040
[Leann] And gameplay
to take the one with the advantage.

281
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,760
I mean, that was so smart.

[tense music plays]

289
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,240
Show me the money.

290
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,960
I don't even wanna look at it.

291
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,600
This game has been testing people
left and right,

292
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,200
but this is what it is now.

293
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,480
This is a harsh reality.
This ain't meant to be fun.

294
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,520
This could be our last day. We don't know.

295
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,800
When you start to feel safe,
this game bites you in your ass.

296
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,160
Look at that damn piggy bank.
Look at the piggy!

297
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,120
"Do you hear me?"

298
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,720
-She's getting squeaky.
-Yeah, it's getting squeaky.

299
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,680
The key thing here is to-- just to make
as much connections as you can

300
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,280
because if something happens like that,

301
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,440
you don't wanna be the one
that they're putting out.

302
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,000
But I don't have "an alliance."

303
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,920
I can confide in you, and I can trust you,
and I got these conversations,

304
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,400
but we're not the type
to be, like, "Oh, it's an alliance."

305
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,120
Because as soon as people hear that,
they feel threatened.

306
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,040
Winning would completely change
my life, 360.

307
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,040
Um, one of the biggest things
I plan on doing

308
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,760
if or when I win the money,

309
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,040
um, I would actually donate
a portion of it

310
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,480
to a kidney donor assistance center

311
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,440
because I actually donated my kidney
to my brother this time last year, so…

312
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,040
Yeah, my little kidney
is pumping through his body now.

313
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,839
So thank God, you know.
So, um, yeah, he is doing good.

314
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,480
Definitely seeing, like,
his health increasing,

315
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,000
um, and getting better,
I think, is so beautiful.

316
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,359
Happy for him. [chuckles]

317
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,800
I would never say
this shit to his face though.

318
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,360
Like, me and my brothers don't have
that relationship at all. [laughs]

319
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,800
[278] I know that was hard,

320
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,440
but I'd rather you open that box
than that elimination box.

321
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,000
I was like, "Damn,
what I'mma do if my bitch leave?"

322
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,320
I was cursing you the hell out.

323
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,080
[laughs]

324
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,600
[Phalisia] I know. I saw you crying.

325
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,440
I was crying. You made me cry, stupid ho.

326
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,240
[Phalisia] You thought I was going home.

327
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,280
I was, like, "She thinks she going home.
I think she going home."

328
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,360
[Phalisia] It was so many emotions.
It-- I was so nervous.

329
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,320
I didn't wanna be up there by myself.

330
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,680
I know. But you made
some great decisions, girl.

331
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,200
I was like, "Oh, that's my girl!"

332
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,160
I've never been
so mentally taxed in my life.

333
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,440
-Except for labor.
-[both laugh]

334
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,520
[musical swell plays]

335
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,080
You know, I was a straight-A student,
like, coming up,

336
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,440
especially in high school. Like, I was--

337
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,160
I was bad as shit
in high school, you know?

338
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,360
I-- I used to fight in school, you know,

339
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,520
talk back to teachers,
but I always kept good grades.

340
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,520
And so, you know,
the teachers and the counselors,

341
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,080
they would take me under their wings

342
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,760
because they saw,
like, so much potential in me.

343
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,120
Like, I ended up going to Smith College.

344
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,760
I'm on the campus for the first time.
It's so white.

345
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,280
Like, it's like a culture shock for me.
You know, I'm coming from Atlanta.

346
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,960
Atlanta is the Black mecca of the US,

347
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,080
and so it was a culture shock.

348
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,360
But, like, I--

349
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,200
My heart immediately was like,
"Girl, this is your school."

350
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,440
Like, it was so small and so beautiful.

351
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,680
Like, the people were love, you know,
the professors were love.

352
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
And I was like, "Oh, yeah,
this is where I belong."

353
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,600
Being a Smithy
definitely, like, helped shape me,

354
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,720
and the women that I met on campus,

355
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,280
you know, they've made me stronger.

356
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,400

357
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,000

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,120
He, uh, has difficulty trusting people
and letting people in,

374
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,800
but once you're in that inner circle,
you're-- you're locked in.

Well, not my mom,

had, like, me and like ten people
around the house,

[musical swell plays]

428
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,720
So, about six months ago,
my lung collapsed,

429
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,440
and, uh, I was in the hospital
for eight days.

I-- It was really hard breathing for four.

431
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,440
It was, like, chest tubes and surgery,
whole nine yards.

It was-- It was awful.

433
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,840

were with me the entire time.

434
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,840

My mom flew out from Jersey.

435
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,520

in-- in the hospital,

436
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,000
uh, with-- with Cecilia,

437
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:49,480
and, uh, it was-- it was the nicest thing
those two have-- have ever done for me,

00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,080
and I'm forever grateful.

439

440
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,680
really took a physical
and emotional toll on all three of us.

441
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,680

This is so cute.

Give us a basket first.

This is cute!

673
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,480
-It's the juice. It's the juice!
-Oh!

674
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,920
-What's in here?
-[031] I think it's a cookie. Whoa!

675
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
-Look at that! [laughs]
-Oh!

676
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,800

679
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,240

[woman 2] There's candy!

681
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,800
They do love us.

682
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,240
-All right, hold on. Give that to me.
-What?

683
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,320

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,800
-Put that shit back.
-There's marbles in the bottom.

691
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,719
Oh, we got candy, we got-- Oh!

692

[exclaiming]

694
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,719
[339] Let's go!

695
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,360
[man] Guys, can I just say
to the people who did the chores today,

696
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,280
thank you so much.

[breath trembles]

702
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,080
[Trey] I see those marbles,
and my heart sinks.

703
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,080
[chuckles sadly]

704
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,320
[Trey] Either I am going
to eliminate my own mother,

705
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,679
or she is going to eliminate me.

706

[ominous tone plays]

707
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,560

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,719
Oh, marbles! Oh no!

709

712
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,200

This is sick, yo.

716
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,600
[Dan] Damn it,
I knew we should have split up.

717
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,120
[Dan] This is a cruel,
vicious, savage game.

718
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,080
Head-to-head,
we're gonna have to battle it out.

719
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,840
You are trifling.

720
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,600
I looked into my false bottom.
There's no marbles.

721

[sobs]

722
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,920
[Ashley] 229 has become,
like… [sobs] …my homie-lover-friend.

723
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,200
And…

724
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,000
[sniffles]

725
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,840
I know she wants it,
like, way more than I do.

726
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,200
And so that's tough
because somebody has to go home.

[somber music plays]

728
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,000

[sighs heavily]

734
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,760
Favour is starting to cry.
He's-- He's devastated.

735
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,840
[sniffles]

736
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,320
I am wondering if he's gonna stay
this emotional throughout the game.

737
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,960
If that's maybe an advantage for me.

738
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,880
-I don't wanna play you.
-I don't wanna play you.

739
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,880
[Leann] You really better win it.
Seriously.

740
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,160
-Mai, we're gonna play to the death.
-I know, right? We will.

741
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,920

I feel sick, man.

746
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,720
Attention, players.

747
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,400

head-to-head against your picnic partner.

751
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,480
And… only half of you will return.

[Leann] Most mothers
would just let their kid win.

755
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,000
[Phalisia] One of us
is not coming out of here.

756
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,200
-[TJ] I'm here to win. That's it.
-[sobs]

757
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,760
[woman 1] I am literally terrified.

Please, God.

759
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,120

760
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,560
[man 2] I don't wanna lose.
I don't wanna go home.

761

[woman 2] I feel like people
are gonna start changing.

762

-[man 3] I wanna win that money.
-[man 4] I need to win this game.

763
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,360
[man 5] Just like that. Anybody can go.

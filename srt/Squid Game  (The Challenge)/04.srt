[254] Come on, everyone in.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,080
I know we all want to be here,
but it's really deciding--

29
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,240
We all wanna be here 100%, right?

30
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,920
But a part of the game now
is three of us has to go.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,280
And we have to find
some equitable way to do that.

32
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,360
We could just find
a very easy either game or resolution

33
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,800
where we all agree

34
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,880
that three people could become eliminated

I'm a keynote physician

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,040
so usually I play a team-leader role.

43
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,560
Every time we feel triggered,
if we have techniques,

44
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,080
we could start to center ourself
and ask ourselves to choose.

45
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,160
Are we coming from a place of fear,

46
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,160
or are we coming from a place of love?

47
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,120
Based on what I've heard so far,
collecting everything,

48
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,440
I think it is best
if there's a three-person tie

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,520
and we all agree
who those three people are.

50
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,480
-No.
-[TJ] No way.

51

just not really, just, grounded.

54
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,160
Um, he's very entitled, and he has an ego.

55
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,080
In this game,
there's no room for arrogance.

56
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,040
You guys mind
if I say something about that?

57
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,280
So I think, like,
if anyone wants to leave,

58
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,560
of course,
that is kind of on the verge of it,

59
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,280
remember that, like,
there are people here who do want to stay.

60
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,240
I think for fairness, though,
because we're in a big group right now,

61
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,880
not everyone is always comfortable
sharing their opinions this way.

and then we'll figure it out.

[Rick] Places like this,

when there's gonna be alliances,

67
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,560
and everybody wants to look
for the leaders of these alliances,

68
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,960
um, my nature is to keep a low profile.

69
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,160
I've made most of my friends here.

70
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,080
My alliances have been made.
You know you got to have that alliance.

71
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,240
'Cause you might need
other people to help you.

73
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,640
We're not wasting our votes
on Doc, are we?

74
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,280
I don't hang around
with doctors like that.

75
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,640
They take control of things.

76
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,800
I-- I have very few doctor friends
'cause a whole lot of them are like that.

77
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,200
-Yeah.
-Um, I do not associate with doctors.

78
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,680
There's several people out there
that do have followers.

79
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,520
And by removing them,
the followers will scramble,

80
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,040
and this might help
the gganbu gang somehow get to the end.

81
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,360
Listen, as long as we're all solid,
I think we'll be okay.

82
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,480
I think we all need to stick
because if we spread our votes out,

83
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,520
one of us could get mistakenly
picked off by one vote.

I'm 100% with that.

101
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,280
[Chaney] All right, so let's talk.
Um, what's the strategy?

102
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,280
We have to eliminate people
and protect people.

103
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,480
Yeah, but we-- we gonna stick together.

104
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,840
But you know, TJ, here's the thing.
We need to understand our solid group.

-We have a solid group.
-Jesse and Sid is part of this group.

-Solid, solid, solid.
-[Chaney] Jesse is solid.

107
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,360
[Chaney] So I know
who I want to eliminate.

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,200
I just don't wanna be the first person
right now to make that decision

109
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,280
because if my team are not behind me,

a target on my back.

I've heard many numbers.

116
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,720
One of the biggest ones
I've heard is Dr. V.

117
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,480
Doc, "the doc," they call him as well.

118
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,040
I feel that,
'cause he's quite a big character

119
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,520
in-- in terms of well-liked, well-known.

120
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,080
Clearly a ve-- very intelligent man,
people might think he's gonna be a threat.

121
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,680
[Bee] He's a target for that.
Um, apparently 374 was like,

122
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,840
"I'm ready to go home."

123
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,600
Oh!

124
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,440
Apparently 374 is the person saying,
like, "I don't wanna be here anymore."

-[man] That was 374?
-Yeah.

-He was sitting over there in the corner.
-[man] Okay.

128
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,520
[Dash] I have a theory.

129
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,800
[softly] We need to vote together.

-Mm-hmm.
-You can't be voting a random bitch.

131
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,920
People are gonna be voting in groups,
and it puts everybody at risk.

132

-But do you think you're at risk?
-And if--

133

Do you think you're at risk?

134
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,880
This is a personal thing.

[359] I heard TJ was one of them.

I do come across as, um, intimidating.

I have a master's degree.

So, not only am I beautiful,
but I'm also intelligent.

162

you know, beautiful, smart women.

which means that I'm not taking my time.

166
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,800
I'm being impatient,
and I'm not thinking thoroughly through.

167
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,320
I have a great mind, you know?
Like, I can think through everything,

168
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,520
but under pressure,

169
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
you can make a mistake
just like that. [snaps]

-[gasps]
-Come on, everyone!

173
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,440
What is it?

174
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,600
There's enough apple slices for everyone.

175
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,000
We walked into the room.
There was a bowl of whole apples.

176
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,320
-[019] Of green apples.
-Yeah.

177
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,240
It sounds like a real story. [chuckles]

178
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,040
[Lorenzo] "Oh, look at us.
How good we are."

179
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,840
"We cut all these apples for you."

180
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,160
They're coming with apples.
Okay. It smells fishy to me.

181
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,000
Like, it's not that they're coming
with, you know, chocolates.

182
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,920
So I'm wary of these apples.

183
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,720
We just wondered
if you guys wanted something, a treat?

184
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,559
I'm not that excited about apple.

185
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,840
I think I'm gonna pass. Thank you.

186
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,080
Thank you for the kindness,
but I don't want that.

187
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,640
[Leann] We're just here
to bring apples to everyone.

188
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:48,320
161, I found him to be impolite.

189
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,480
Possibly rude.

190
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,160
-[man] Thank you.
-You're welcome.

191
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,240
-Thank you.
-[Leann] You're welcome.

192
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,600
[Lorenzo] Okay, I'm done
with the story about apples.

193
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,520
I will naturally not go
out of my way to make friends

194
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,360
'cause I-- I don't really care about that,

195
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,000
and I know
if there's that energy in the room,

196
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,760
they would just come to me,
and they would be loyal friends,

197
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,160
and I'm sure of that.

198
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,360
Um, so, no, actually,
I cannot stand people pleasers

199
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,880
and go around, be like, "Hi, how are you?"
Discussing things you do not care about.

200
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,640
We don't have a connection,
don't have to hang around with each other.

201
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,200
We're just there for the circumstances.
I will not be doing that.

202
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,200
Even for the game.
I just can't stand it. I'm allergic to it.

203
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,960
Like, no. It feels fake.

204
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,680
It needs to feel genuine,
so that, I will keep it that way.

[Dash] The thing about this

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,600
is if you're the first person
to vote somebody new,

240
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,360
you literally expose your vote,

241
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,160

a huge disadvantage in this game.

to vote someone out at this point.

to put up a new name and a new face.

347
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,200
[Dash] It is so obvious
that 179 is the ringleader

00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,360
of that core four alliance,

[Leann] I mean,
the only reason I voted for 1-6-1

408
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,280
was I had just seen him be
a little rude sometimes, and…

409

anything positive to say.

414
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,640
and I worked in a lot of departments.

415
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,480
I was hired to work in sports
because that was my background.

416
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,120

I never had dolls.

uh, so I played sports.

in high school and younger,

422
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,200

I voted for Chaney,

446

but I'm totally lying to these people
and-- and saying that I didn't,

447
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,480

we'll be better off.

that follow them.

That's what I did.

Thank goodness
I wasn't responsible for his elimination.

668

We did some dishes.

I just had a dream about him too, like…

680
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,000

I just hope that she's not, like--
My daughter's not thinking,

like, "Where's Mommy?"
Like, I hope she's just, like, calm.

688
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,120
I know I thought about it.

689
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,160
I was like, "I wonder
if my kid, like, asking for me."

[Phalisia] So, we tried having kids, um…

with IUI,
which is intrauterine insemination.

698

706
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,880

708

Um, and, um…

709
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,360
So we took a break
on just trying and focusing on us.

710
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,560
Getting back to loving one another
and en-- enjoying one another, and…

711
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,000
[sighs] …we got to another point
in our life where we were ready.

And, um…

713
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,040
Yeah, we were blessed with a baby girl,

714
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,400
and she looks nothing like me

715
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,720
and a lot like my wife,

716
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,400

and it just works out so perfectly.

00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,200
[Dash] I-- I'm scared
of being in the front honestly.

[Phalisia] Before today,
I've been like a silent prowler, I guess,

740
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,360
but now it's time. The--

741
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,240
The numbers are starting to get lower.
I need to start stepping up.

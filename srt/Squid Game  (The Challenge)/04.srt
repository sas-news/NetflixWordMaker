[254] Come on, everyone in.

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,080
I know we all want to be here,

29
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,240
We all wanna be here 100%, right?

30
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,920
But a part of the game now
is three of us has to go.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,280
And we have to find
some equitable way to do that.

32
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,360
We could just find
a very easy either game or resolution

33
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,800
where we all agree

34
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,880
that three people could become eliminated

so usually I play a team-leader role.

43
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,560
Every time we feel triggered,
if we have techniques,

44
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,080
we could start to center ourself
and ask ourselves to choose.

45
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,160
Are we coming from a place of fear,

46
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,160
or are we coming from a place of love?

47
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,120
Based on what I've heard so far,
collecting everything,

48
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,440
I think it is best
if there's a three-person tie

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,520
and we all agree
who those three people are.

50

-No.
-[TJ] No way.

just not really, just, grounded.

54
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,160
Um, he's very entitled, and he has an ego.

55
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,080
In this game,
there's no room for arrogance.

56
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,040
You guys mind
if I say something about that?

57
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,280
So I think, like,
if anyone wants to leave,

58
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,560
of course,
that is kind of on the verge of it,

59
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,280
remember that, like,
there are people here who do want to stay.

60
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,240
I think for fairness, though,
because we're in a big group right now,

61
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,880
not everyone is always comfortable
sharing their opinions this way.

when there's gonna be alliances,

67
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,560
and everybody wants to look
for the leaders of these alliances,

68
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,960
um, my nature is to keep a low profile.

69
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,160
I've made most of my friends here.

70
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,080
My alliances have been made.
You know you got to have that alliance.

71
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,240
'Cause you might need
other people to help you.

We're not wasting our votes
on Doc, are we?

74
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,280
I don't hang around
with doctors like that.

75
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,640
They take control of things.

76
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,800
I-- I have very few doctor friends
'cause a whole lot of them are like that.

77
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,200
-Yeah.
-Um, I do not associate with doctors.

78

There's several people out there
that do have followers.

79
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,520
And by removing them,
the followers will scramble,

80
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,040
and this might help
the gganbu gang somehow get to the end.

81
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,360
Listen, as long as we're all solid,
I think we'll be okay.

82
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,480
I think we all need to stick
because if we spread our votes out,

83
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,520
one of us could get mistakenly
picked off by one vote.

[Chaney] All right, so let's talk.
Um, what's the strategy?

102
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,280
We have to eliminate people
and protect people.

103
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,480
Yeah, but we-- we gonna stick together.

104
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,840
But you know, TJ, here's the thing.
We need to understand our solid group.

-We have a solid group.
-Jesse and Sid is part of this group.

-Solid, solid, solid.
-[Chaney] Jesse is solid.

[Chaney] So I know
who I want to eliminate.

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,200
I just don't wanna be the first person
right now to make that decision

109

because if my team are not behind me,

I've heard many numbers.

116

One of the biggest ones
I've heard is Dr. V.

117
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,480
Doc, "the doc," they call him as well.

118
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,040
I feel that,
'cause he's quite a big character

119
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,520
in-- in terms of well-liked, well-known.

120
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,080
Clearly a ve-- very intelligent man,
people might think he's gonna be a threat.

121
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,680
[Bee] He's a target for that.
Um, apparently 374 was like,

122
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,840
"I'm ready to go home."

123
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,600
Oh!

124
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,440
Apparently 374 is the person saying,
like, "I don't wanna be here anymore."

-He was sitting over there in the corner.
-[man] Okay.

128
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,520
[Dash] I have a theory.

129

[softly] We need to vote together.

-You can't be voting a random bitch.

131
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,920
People are gonna be voting in groups,
and it puts everybody at risk.

-But do you think you're at risk?
-And if--

Do you think you're at risk?

134
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,880
This is a personal thing.

I have a master's degree.

but I'm also intelligent.

which means that I'm not taking my time.

166
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,800
I'm being impatient,
and I'm not thinking thoroughly through.

167
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,320
I have a great mind, you know?
Like, I can think through everything,

168
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,520
but under pressure,

169
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
you can make a mistake
just like that. [snaps]

-[gasps]
-Come on, everyone!

173
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,440
What is it?

174
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,600
There's enough apple slices for everyone.

175
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,000
We walked into the room.
There was a bowl of whole apples.

176
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,320
-[019] Of green apples.
-Yeah.

177
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,240
It sounds like a real story. [chuckles]

178
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,040
[Lorenzo] "Oh, look at us.
How good we are."

179
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,840
"We cut all these apples for you."

180
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,160
They're coming with apples.
Okay. It smells fishy to me.

181
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,000
Like, it's not that they're coming
with, you know, chocolates.

182
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,920
So I'm wary of these apples.

183
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,720
We just wondered
if you guys wanted something, a treat?

184
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,559
I'm not that excited about apple.

185
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,840
I think I'm gonna pass. Thank you.

186
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,080
Thank you for the kindness,
but I don't want that.

187
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,640
[Leann] We're just here
to bring apples to everyone.

188
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:48,320
161, I found him to be impolite.

189
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,480
Possibly rude.

190
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,160
-[man] Thank you.
-You're welcome.

191
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,240
-Thank you.
-[Leann] You're welcome.

192
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,600
[Lorenzo] Okay, I'm done
with the story about apples.

193
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,520
I will naturally not go
out of my way to make friends

194
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,360
'cause I-- I don't really care about that,

195
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,000
and I know
if there's that energy in the room,

196
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,760
they would just come to me,
and they would be loyal friends,

197
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,160
and I'm sure of that.

198
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,360
Um, so, no, actually,
I cannot stand people pleasers

199
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,880
and go around, be like, "Hi, how are you?"
Discussing things you do not care about.

200
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,640
We don't have a connection,
don't have to hang around with each other.

201
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,200
We're just there for the circumstances.
I will not be doing that.

202
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,200
Even for the game.
I just can't stand it. I'm allergic to it.

203
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,960
Like, no. It feels fake.

204
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,680
It needs to feel genuine,
so that, I will keep it that way.

[Dash] The thing about this

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,600
is if you're the first person
to vote somebody new,

240
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,360
you literally expose your vote,

241
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,160

a huge disadvantage in this game.

to vote someone out at this point.

to put up a new name and a new face.

347
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,200
[Dash] It is so obvious
that 179 is the ringleader

348
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,360
of that core four alliance,

349

the only reason I voted for 1-6-1

408

was I had just seen him be
a little rude sometimes, andâ€¦

I was an editor at the <i>New York Times,</i>

414
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,640
and I worked in a lot of departments.

415
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,480
I was hired to work in sports
because that was my background.

416
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,120

I never had dolls.

uh, so I played sports.

in high school and younger,

422
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,200

I voted for Chaney,

446

but I'm totally lying to these people
and-- and saying that I didn't,

447

the leader of an alliance.

I just hope that she's not, like--
My daughter's not thinking,

which is intrauterine insemination.

Um, and, umâ€¦

709

So we took a break
on just trying and focusing on us.

Getting back to loving one another
and en-- enjoying one another, andâ€¦

711
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,000

And, umâ€¦

713
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,040
Yeah, we were blessed with a baby girl,

714
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,400
and she looks nothing like me

715
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,720

I've been like a silent prowler, I guess,

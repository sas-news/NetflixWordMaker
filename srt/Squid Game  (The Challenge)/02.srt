are a really important thing in life,

187

and… it's fine
to not have answers immediately.

188

I like how you played that.

into the background here more,

for the long game 'cause I'm not trying
to be the loudest person here.

381
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,560
432's the loudest person here.
You ain't gonna be louder than him.

Just rubbing people, like, the wrong way.

386

We're all here for a reason.
We're here to win a prize.

387
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
But that can also be won with humility.

388
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,360
Okay, so there's actually less people
in here than I thought.

389
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,560
A lot less. This is circle and triangle.

390
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,680
-Circle and triangle, yeah.
-Now they have star.

[Dani] I do have insecurities.

397
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,600
I-- I am scared about people trusting me.

398
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,760
I'm scared about
the way people perceive me.

399
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,280
Like, if they like me,
if they think I'm funny,

or they think I'm charming,
things like that.

401
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,520
I'm insecure about how
I don't have, like, a boyfriend,

402
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,840
a serious relationship at the age of 23.

403
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,360
All my friends are getting married
or are pregnant and having kids.

404
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,440
I'm insecure, like,
why does no one like me?

405
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,080
Part of this experience

406
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,160
is proving to myself
that I'm capable of doing something crazy.

407
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,080
But… to, like, like yourself
and love yourself

408

and, like, the flaws, and--

409
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,680
I think that-- that's really difficult,

410
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,600

really like or love myself

Oh, snap.

669
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,960
Get out here, get out here!

670
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,640
[Stephen] We gotta get up for this.

671
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,920
[man 136] Now this I wanna see.

672

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,880
Wow.

695
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,040
We deserve this.

696
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,600
That's it.

697
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,440
[man 336] And somebody here
is gonna win that. Isn't that nuts?

698
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,840
It's pretty cool, man.

699
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,040
[Stephen] I wanna get that money,
but I know I need to go make some friends

700
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,760
because, after Dalgona,
I've lost half of my alliance.

701
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,880
My boy 101 Kyle was in the fourth line,

702
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,680
my fellow mullet boy,
and he never showed back up.

703
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,280
I don't know about you guys.
I feel a little bit sad. All my guys gone.

704
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,440
My best friend Chase was here with me
in Red Light, Green Light.

705
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,760
They zapped him
almost first things first, eliminated.

706
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,760
I think it's very important
to have an alliance

707
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,640
just in case
we're able to pick our own teams,

708
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,560
especially if it comes to the tug-of-war.

709
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,000
But it looks like this
is the new crew right here.

710
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,200
Yeah. Right here.

711
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,840
[Stephen] It's the new little alliance.

712
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,520
Got some brains, little bit of strength.

713
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,680
-Little old man strength.
-[Stephen] We got the wisdom.

714
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,400
We need to come up with a team name.

715
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,400
Gganbu.

716
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,560
-Gganbu, yeah. Gganbu gang.
-Gganbu?

717
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,120
-That means "best friends" in Korea.
-Best friends, yeah. Gganbu.

718
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,400
Gganbu gang?

719
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,520
-Yeah, gganbu gang.
-[Stephen] I like it.

720
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,800
[Rick] I like to have strategy
and-- and-- and a game plan.

721
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,000
Um, you know, I found the allies,
the gganbu gang,

722
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,440
that can help me win this.

723
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,160
And, uh, I think we're a very strong gang.

724
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,240
And, uh-- And if-- if we lose,
whatever the game is,

725
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,640
I'm losing with friends,
and I can handle that very easily.

726
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,840
Hey, knucks it in the middle.

727
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,960
[all] Gganbu gang.

728
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,520
-Gganbu gang, whoo!
-I like it. That's pretty freakin' cool.

729
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,120
What shapes did you have?

730
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,600
I had the easy. Circle.

731
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,160
-I feel bad. [laughs]
-Don't. Was you in-- I had the circle!

732
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,760
I had an umbrella. [laughs]

733
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,200
You need that, like, tattooed
on you or something.

734
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,520
-I'm gonna tattoo a circle, are you?
-Yeah.

735
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,480
[Leann] I am in this game

736
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:26,040
more as a personal challenge.

737
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,120
[gentle music plays]

738
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,520
I wanna do it to prove I still have…

739
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,000
the thing that's inside me
that I haven't seen for a long time.

740
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,680
I want the opportunity…

741
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,720
to show you can keep trying new things
and doing new things.

742
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,560
And I wanted to prove it to myself.

743
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,400
So… thought this is
a good chance to do that, I think.

744
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,440
I don't know what to expect,

745
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,760
but… I think this is a good chance

746
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:01,000
to… meet people from all over the world.

747
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,040
And I hope I make friends that I'll have.

748
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,240
So I'm excited about it.

749
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,680
I'm really not scared.
I'm-- I'm just excited about it.

750
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:18,560
I don't think the men
generally realize what women have.

751
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,120
-It's discounted, you know?
-[367] But maybe that's for the best.

752
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,800
I love just being able
to have people think I'm the underdog.

753
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,520
But, that aside,

754
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,840
do you think it's key

755
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,600
to get to know, shall we say--

756
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,040
-For the purpose of teamwork?
-…some of the big, strong ones?

757
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,680
These are the strategies
that we need to be drawing on

There's something going on.

Don't touch it. Don't touch it.
Don't touch it. Don't touch it!

00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,560
Don't touch it! [laughs]

768
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,840
It's got to be something like a test.

769
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,880
I'm just hanging, kind of just watching.

770
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,880
'Cause I don't wanna be involved
in anything.

771
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,680
I don't want people to know who I am.

772
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,320
If this pho--
this whole phone thing <i>is </i>a test,

773
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,280
why would they choose me for elimination,
when they don't know I exist?

774
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,000
-[man 1] Maybe we can call someone?
-Pick it up. Somebody pick it up.

775

-[man 2] I'll pick it up.
-L-Let it ring first. Let it ring.

There's nothing. There's nothing.

00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,800
They look like a bunch of monkeys
that don't know what the hell it is.

784
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,760
God damn it.

785
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,400
I just think I need to get
to that phone first, before anyone else.

786
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,480
Who do you reckon-- Okay.

787
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,960
If you had the option to eliminate,
who's your number one?

788
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,560
-432, I think.
-Yeah, that'd be it.

789
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,000
-Are you okay?
-[Bryton] No.

790
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,920
-You didn't eat, did you?
-Mm-mmm.

791
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,240
-I'm just trying to conserve my energy.
-I know.

792
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,000
432 is out there. He's brash.

793
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,320
And I'm not here to be everyone's mom,

794
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,040
but I just wanted to talk to him

795
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,960
to see if he reall--
if that really was who he was.

796
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,120
The people that don't like me in here
have no sense of humor.

797
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,160
-Or they interpret you differently.
-Differently, yeah.

798
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,920
They interpret you as abrasive, and like--

799
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,320
-You know?
-Yeah, and it-- that's just not it at all.

800
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,200
-Like-- Yeah.
-Well, you talk, you don't think.

801
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,920
It's just purely intrinsic, like…

802
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,160
-Yeah, it's because--
-"I'm out there immediately."

803
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,600
And it can be interpreted
as abrasive, you know?

804
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,280
But you have to realize if people think
that I'm not gonna be myself

805
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,480
for a split second--

806
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,520
-Is it totally yourself?
-One thousand percent.

807
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,440
See? That's-- Then that's what you are.

808
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,840
He isn't, like, putting on a face.
He-- It's who he is.

809
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,160
My only thought, um, with 432 is, like,

810
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,840
if we are ever going to play tug-of-war,

811
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,760
he has the strength

812
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,760
to make up having me on his team.

813
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,200
-Someone said you played in college?
-Yes, ma'am.

814
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,680
-What'd you play?
-Football.

815
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,720
-Where?
-Clemson.

816
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,840
The Tigers.

817
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,320
-Yeah.
-And did-- did you graduate?

818
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,520
No, ma'am. I drop--
I dropped out to come here.

819
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,760
I have one semester left.

820
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,000
So, why'd you come? Why'd you come here?

821
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,920
I like challenges,
so I can talk about it later in life.

822
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,400
Like, I was raised,
and I had to learn everything on my own.

823
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,240
Like, yeah, my mom worried,
and she stressed.

824
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,560
Your dad wasn't around?

825
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,560
No, it was just me and my mom.

826
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,680
-Aw.
-Just-- She was my best friend, but…

827
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,320
-It is what it is.
-Well, you're a good son.

828
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,080
-I try.
-You're not abrasive.

829
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,200
I know I'm not.

830
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,080
-But 120 people think I am.
-[laughs]

831
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,440
-Well, 119.
-No, there's fewer than that.

832
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,120
[Bryton] From the moment
that I was put on this Earth,

833
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,240
it was just me and my mom.

834
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,720
So there was no trust from, like, uh,

835
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,880
a father standpoint,
or there was no trust from,

836
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,840
um,

837
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,240
I don't know.
I wasn't really born into trust.

838
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,040
I wasn't--
The only person I could trust was my mom.

839
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,960
And at times,
I couldn't even trust my mom because--

840
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,280
How much can--

841
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,840
My mom had me when she was 21,

842
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,080
so how much can a 20-year-old white woman

843
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,400
teach a young Black kid?

844
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,240
Like, there's only so much
that she could do,

845
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,600
so I trusted her with everything.

846
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,720
You know, don't get it wrong.
I-- I love her to death.

847
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,480
That-- That is, like, my best friend
on this planet.

848
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,880
But you gotta understand

849
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,040
that from the moment
I was put on this Earth,

850
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,120
there was…

851
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,000
There wasn't really anybody
for me to trust.

852
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,720
There wasn't really anybody
for me to just, like--

853
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,360
Nobody understood who I was,

854
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,200
and I still

855
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,320
don't think anybody really does.

856
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,840
[musical swell plays and intensifies]

857
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,280
[Husnain] Imagine if it just rang now.

858
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,080
[man] We're gonna do a three-part breath
that basically goes like this.

859
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,920
So you're gonna open your mouth
wider than is comfortable.

860
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,320
You're gonna breathe into the belly first.
A breath like… [gasps]

861
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,840
[inhales sharply]

862
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,320
Then blow it out. [breathes forcefully]

863
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,120
So it's gonna be work, all right?

864
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,160
[man 330] The last couple of days
have been crazy.

865
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,640
Little sleep, bunch of stress,
and so many people are up in their heads.

866
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,560
As a performance and longevity doctor,

867
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,600
I know that when we are
in our stress state,

868
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,680
it takes us out of who we really are.

869
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,280
So I really learned
to actually calm people down,

870
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,920
and put them in the thrive state,
who they authentically are.

871
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,440
I'm all for bringing people
back to the present.

872
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,320
Be in this moment

873
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,520
right now.

874
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,480
A cheerleader,
whenever they jump in the air,

875
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,120
they spread their legs in air,
and they touch their toes.

876
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,280
[Dr. V] All right, let's--

877
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,960
-You got it, bro.
-Beautiful.

878
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,840
[Dr. V] Predictions for-- for the day?

879
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,920
I predict they're gonna call

880
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,120
and ask for a number to answer the phone,

881
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,080
and that number will be eliminated.

882
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,720
[Bryton] So it's like… [grunts]

883
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,360

I wanna answer this phone
in hope that I get to eliminate someone.

889

I wanna eliminate 432.

890

I wanted to eliminate someone.

Who? I guess whoever took the burger.

940
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,760
No, 432. He said
that he was gonna snap me in half.

-Yeah.

-I don't wanna touch that phone.
-I'm not answering a random phone.

-Yep, pizza.
-I wouldn't blame you.

eat the pizza,
but don't tell anybody you got pizza.

950

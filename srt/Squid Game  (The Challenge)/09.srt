I made it this far,

My main goal is, you know, to help
as many, you know, immigrants as possible,

to play her game for herself,

about why I chose
to eliminate his friend 278

137
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,560
so that way, you know,
he-- he doesn't see me

143

I didn't-- I didn't feel
any animosity towards you.

-I understand it's a game.
-Mm-hmm.

145

But I think we're all just agreeing on

146
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,720
a-- a game of civil decency.

147
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Mm-hmm.

148
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,960
And I think that was everyone's rationale

149
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,000
with the self-nomination

150
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,320
because it very quickly
could have devolved into… chaos.

And when I stood on the Glass Bridge,
I thought I knew Ashley

154
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,080
until she showed me
that she-- lack of teamwork.

not taking a risk for anybody,

156

and everybody who just takes over
to make that decision for her.

157
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,000
To me, that is selfish,
and I just wanted you to understand

158
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,480
that… it's not that Ashley
that I don't like.

159
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,799
It's-- It's the character
that makes me look at her,

160
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,919
"Will-- Will she have my back if--
in a situation of life and death?"

161
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,840
Right.

162
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,960
So I just want to understand that, um--
where I'm coming from.

I've been trying to play this game

164

in a way that I would be proud of

165
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,680
and that I would act in the outside world.

166
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,240
As long as we keep our eye
on our hearts and our humanity.

167
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,480
-Yeah.
-Because we all have that good core.

168
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,560
And that's-- that's all we have
to keep our eyes on.

169

Player 287 has me uneasy.

-Okay.

343
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,920
Would you betray me
at this point, Elliott?

344
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,120
-You're my son.
-This early?

345
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,760
-You're my son, man.
-I respect that.

346
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,280
That'd be a bold move
if one of you two took me out this soon.

347
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,720
All right. All right.

Hey, man,
I was in your position yesterday.

351
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,600
I ain't in no rush
to put a box on nobody's desk.

352
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,520
If you did have a box,
whose desk would you put it on first?

353
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,720
-Mai.
-[Roland laughs]

354
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,720
-Ashley!
-[Roland] That'd be a little obvious.

355
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,520
-So?
-[Roland] Yeah, that's fair.

356
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,640
I feel like in the zone,
she would go for Mai.

357
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,080
You'd go for me?

358
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,960
-[Roland] No, I wouldn't.
-[Mai] Oh.

-You're my dawg.
-I know. You're my buddy, bud.

[pulsing music intensifies]

with all of you,

which is fair.

00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,880
Picking you?

366
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,920

[Phill] Mmm.

175
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,200
Phill, where you from?

176
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,480
I'm from Brazil.

177
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,840
Um, I was born in São Paulo,
and I grew up there until I was eight,

178
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,480
and then my family and I
moved to New Jersey,

179
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,120
where I spent most of my life.

180
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,720
Um, I studied psychology and education,

181
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,520
and I knew I wanted to be somewhere warm,
and so I just sort of picked Hawaii,

182
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,320
and was like, "Hey, you know,
seems like a solid spot."

183
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,880
And so I went there, and I basically
bounced around a bunch of jobs,

184
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,280
um, until eventually I landed
on scuba diving.

185
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,280
And now I've been teaching there
for about a year.

186
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,800
-What about you, Sam?
-[Mai] Sam?

187
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,280
-[Sam] Oh, man.
-What's your story?

188
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,480
[Sam] I was born in Idaho.

189
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,640
I grew up to a super religious family,

190
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,080
and, um,

191
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,680
it took me a while
to realize that I was gay.

192
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,000
And when I did, I knew that…

193
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,240
I was no longer welcome.

194
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,640
So I moved to Texas

195
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,720
and met my now husband, Doug.

196
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,760
It's so incredible to finally feel happy

197
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,400
for the first time in my life

198
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,280
when I always thought I was happy,
but I was just fine.

199
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,480
How about you, Mai? What's your story?

200
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,280
I grew up in Vietnam.

201
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,760
I came over to United States
in a refugee camp when I was eight.

202
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,560
I'm married with two daughters,
and a granddaughter.

203
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,200
-And two beautiful dogs.
-[Phill] Aw.

204
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,880
-Aw.
-[Phill] That's very cute.

205
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,600
My life in a nutshell. [chuckles]

206
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,680
[Phill] Right on.

207
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,120
[ominous tone plays]

208
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,080
[Mai] I finished high school
at 18 years of age,

209
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,040
and, you know,
I lived in a very sheltered life

210
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,280
and very strict,

211
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,520
and s-so I-- I wanted
to break out of that shelter,

212
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,040
and so I joined the navy.

213
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,520
I wanted to be an individual,

214
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,080
but, you know, being naive,
going to the navy,

215
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,360
it's like, you know, going
to a pack of wolves

216
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,080
where, you know, I--

217
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,800
you know, I was bullied.

218
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,120
And I got pregnant at 19

219
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,120
'cause I-- I was a virgin
up until I joined the navy,

220
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,040
and I didn't know anything, so…

221
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,880
And, you know, uh,
to get pregnant at 19 was, um…

222
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,520
was very hard because when I--

223
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,320
I have a-- You know,
I had to, uh, tell my family

224
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,680
that I got pregnant,

225
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,080
and, um…

226
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,960
And then my family just, uh…

227
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,120
[voice breaks] …cut me off.

228
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,360
[sobs] And I had no one
when I was pregnant.

229
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,440
It was very hard.

230
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,200
[sobs]

231
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,000
I-- I didn't know anything
about motherhood.

232
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,960
I didn't have anyone.

233
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,640

[Phill] Thank you.

238

Man, we really did make it, huh?
This is crazy.

239
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,480
My partner is gonna expect me
to come back a millionaire now,

240
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,480
so it's gonna be really embarrassing
if I don't.

241
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,720
You mean when you don't?

[Sam] I love everything about this.

I don't really wanna press

that if Phill or Sam pick the green button

and get a choice to pick a player
to go into the next game,

281

they would support each other.

[Sam] I want desperately
to go through to the final.

It's a big choice to make.

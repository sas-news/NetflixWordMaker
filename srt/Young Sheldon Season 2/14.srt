we'll pick it up here tomorrow.

00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:33,450
we may find a fossil as old

Cooper!

30
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:44,211
Will you put these away for me?

31
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,087
Sure.

32
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,089
You better watch yourself.

33
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,967
I will,

34
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,967
I-I really will.

35
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:52,219

Who was that?

38
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,435
No one.

39
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,437
Why did he push you?

40
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,814
None of your business.

41
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:05,733
But that was

42
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:05,733
a clear violation

43
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,234

We need to tell on him.

We're not telling on anyone,

47
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,112
stay out of it.

48
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,531
But the student code

00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,783

00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,953
You should probably

wash your hands.

75
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,831
I just witnessed

Altercation?

00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,836
A confrontation,

80
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,836
a tussle. Anyway,

81
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,672
I'd just like to gather

82
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,672
more information

83
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,507
for sociological purposes.

84
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,344
Oh, I heard about you,

85
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,344
you're that smart kid.

86
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:20,099
I'd like to be humble in this

87
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:20,099
moment, but yes, that's me.

88
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,767
Sheldon Cooper, at your service.

89
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:25,562
So Georgie's your brother?

90
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:25,562
Correct.

91
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,731
And you're trying

92
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,731
to protect him?

93
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:31,902
Incorrect. I'm just curious

94
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:31,902
what he did to incur your wrath.

95
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,695
Also, kudos on the hand washing.

96
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,823
Your brother's a punk.

97
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,408
I'm not familiar

98
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,408
with that terminology.

99
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,619
He tried to hit on

100
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,619
my girlfriend.

101
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:44,289
Interesting. So he openly

102
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:44,289
pursued your mate,

103
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,666
and to re-assert dominance,

104
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,835
you threatened him

105
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,835
with physical violence.

106
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,670
Hell yeah, I did.

107
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,212
I understand that.

108
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,382
I often intimidate people

109
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,382
with my intelligence.

110
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,932
Well, one of us scared him.

111
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,936

112
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,936
MARCUS: All right.

113
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:09,314
Next. Missy Cooper.

114
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,111
Just a heads-up,

115
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,111
this is my good side.

116
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:16,279
Okay...

117
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,282
Do your parents know

118
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,282
you're wearing that makeup?

119
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,826
Oh, yeah, my mom knows.

120
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:24,830
You sure? Because typically

121
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:24,830
it's not allowed.

122
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,166
If you don't believe me,

123
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,166
you can ask her.

124
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,585
Okay, we're gonna

125
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,585
give her a call.

126
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,339
Really?

127
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,384
Good news, I just spoke

128
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,384
to Tommy Clarkson.

129
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,469
What? Are you crazy?

130
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,929
Nope, Mom had me tested.

131
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,264
And Tommy's actually nicer

132
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,264
than you think.

133
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,766
I told you to stay out of it.

134
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,560
True, but what you

135
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,560
didn't tell me

136
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,770
was that you were overly chummy

137
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,770
with his girlfriend,

138
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,731
which is why he wants

139
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,731
to kick your bottom.

140
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,067
I'm about to kick your bottom.

141
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,362
I don't think so.

142
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,613
H-Hey, Tommy.

143
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,448
How you doing?

144
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,745
You got a problem with him,

145
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,745
you got a problem with me.

146
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,788
And just to make

147
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,788
his logic clear,

148
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,373
you do have a problem with me.

149
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,333
Don't listen to my brother,

150
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,333
I don't have

151
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,543
a problem with anybody.

152
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,587
You need to apologize.

153
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,214
I-I'm very sorry.

154
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,630
To him.

155
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,382
I'm very sorry, Sheldon.

156
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,263
Later, kid.

157
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,641
See? He's nice.

158
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,736
What were you even thinking?

159
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,947
I was thinking

160
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,947
I look hot.

161
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,116
You know you're not allowed

162
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,116
to wear makeup.

163
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,951
That's why I didn't tell you.

164
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,536
And who gave it to you?

165
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,536
Heather B.? Heather M.?

166
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,163
Meemaw.

167
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,624
So your grandmother was okay

168
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,624
with you looking like this

169
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,792
in your school pictures?

170
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,794
If you don't believe me,

171
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,794
ask her.

172
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,004
Oh, I'm going to.

173
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,757
Really?

174
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,341
CURT CHAPLIN:

175
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,341
These are the plaintiffs,

176

Valerie and Anthony Sines.

177
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,138

179
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,514

180
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,514
with her cat Scampi,

181
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,768
and that's when his dog went

182
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,768
after Scampi, injuring her.

183
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,604
What are you watching?

184
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,604
Go away.

185
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,314
Are you angry with me?

186
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,066
I don't want to see

187
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,066
your face right now.

188
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:19,987
Very well, but I'd like

196
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,039
I wonder how my new friend

197
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,039
Tommy Clarkson

198
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,332
would feel about this.

199
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,001
Well, he's not here, is he?

200
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,503
No, he's not.

201
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,256
I guess I'll just

202
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,256
have to call him.

203
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,841
You're kidding.

204
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,801
CHAPLIN:

205
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,801
...the case of

206
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,511
a taste of Scampi

207
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,054
after these messages.

208
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,723
Are you going to put on

209
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,723
<i>Professor Proton?</i>

210
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:49,850
No.

211
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,852
Hmm.

212
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,570
Okay, okay.

213
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,365
Thank you.

214
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:11,079
I didn't hear

215
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:11,079
a "you're welcome."

216
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,289
GEORGE JR.:

217
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,289
Shut up!

218
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:13,832
(door slams)

219
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:13,832
We'll work on that.

220
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,168
PROFESSOR PROTON:

221
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,168
It's time for science!

222
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,337
(door closes)

223
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,337
Hello.

224
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:21,048
Well, don't you

225
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:21,048
look like Madonna?

226
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,465
Thank you.

227
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,134
I was actually trying

228
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,134
to look like you.

229
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:25,844
Thank you.

230
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,513
Why would you give her makeup

231
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,513
without talking to me first?

232
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,140
I didn't give her any makeup.

233
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,391
Well, then, one of you is lying.

234
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,727
MEEMAW and MISSY:

235
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,727
She is.

236
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,394
Time to come clean, little lady.

237
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,022
I ain't taking the hit

238
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,022
on this one.

239
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,692
I took the makeup

240
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,692
from Meemaw's bag.

241
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,820
Oh, Missy, you are

242
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,820
in a world of trouble.

243
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,198
Calm down,

244
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,198
it's not that big a deal.

245
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,741
It is so a big deal!

246
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,202
She stole from you,

247
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,202
and then she lied about it.

248
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,662
I know, but come on,

249
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,662
she's only ten.

250
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,540
She's gonna do way stupider

251
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,540
stuff when she's older.

252
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:56,833
Guaranteed.

253
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,335
I don't care.

254
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,587
She is my daughter

255
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,587
and you will be punished.

256
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,965
Sorry, kid.

257
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,551
I wish I was your daughter.

258
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,097
Is that so?

259
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,473
Well, guess what?

260
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,226
You're sleeping here tonight

261
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,603
because I don't feel like

262
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,603
being around either one of you.

263
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,731
Great!

264
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,110
(door slams shut)

265
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,110
Yeah, great.

266
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,826
Georgie, be a lamb

267
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,826
and get me a Yoo-hoo.

268
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,287
Get your own.

269
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,248
Hmm. Are you sure

270
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,248
you want to speak to me

271
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,707
in that tone of voice?

272
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,543
Sheldon, I'm getting

273
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,543
real tired of this.

274
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,297
That's too bad.

275
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,297
I'm enjoying it quite a bit.

276
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,174
Still waiting on that Yoo-hoo.

277
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,634
You think you're so tough now,

278
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,303
I swear, one day I'm...

279
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,303
GEORGE SR.: Hey.

280
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,553
What's going on?

281
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,846
Sheldon's being a jerk.

282
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,265
That true?

283
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,392
All I did was ask for a Yoo-hoo.

284
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,060
He's leaving out

285
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,060
the part where he...

286
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,561
(clears throat)

287
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,689
(sighs) Forget it.

288
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,151
Great. Done.

289
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,610
SHELDON:

290
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,610
Georgie,

291
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,239
at the risk

292
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,239
of repeating myself...

293
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,491
(sighs)

294
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,661
And one from the back,

295
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,661
so it's cold.

296
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,672
So when, exactly,

297
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,672
did you swipe my makeup?

298
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,048
While you were

299
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,048
at bowling league.

300
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,758
You don't have a key

301
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,758
to this house.

302
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,010
How'd you get in?

303
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,303
Can't tell you that.

304
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,553
I might need to do it again.

305
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,889
Unbelievable.

306
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,018
And for future reference,

307
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,018
go lighter on the blush,

308
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:40,187
or you'll end up looking

309
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:40,187
like Raggedy Ann.

310
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:43,482
She got Raggedy Andy

311
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:43,482
looking like that.

312
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,276
He's her brother.

313
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,276
Oh.

314
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,862
I've been playing

315
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,862
with those dolls all wrong.

316
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,198
All right, that'll do it.

317
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,993
How old was Mom when

318
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,993
you let her wear makeup?

319
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:58,038
I don't know, I didn't really

320
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:58,038
have rules like that.

321
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,624
See? How come you're so cool

322
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,624
and she's such a dud?

323
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,418
Well, I wouldn't call her a dud.

324
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,794
What would you call her?

325
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,381
Point is, she wasn't

326
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,381
always like that.

327
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,798
What was she like?

328
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,094
When she was a teenager,

329
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,094
she was just wild.

330
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,055
Really?

331
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,055
(laughing): Oh, yeah.

332
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,973
She used to wait

333
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,973
until I went to sleep

334
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,350
and then she would sneak out

335
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,101
and get into trouble

336
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,101
with her friends.

337
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,769
My mom?

338
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,769
Your mom.

339
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,981
And then she would

340
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,981
climb up the tree

341
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,442
on the side of the house

342
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,442
and sneak back in.

343
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,236
Amazing.

344
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,405
Is that how you're getting in?

345
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,823
I will never tell you that.

346
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,909
(laughing)

347
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,293
Everything okay?

348
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:49,297
I'm getting tired of being

349
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:49,297
the bad guy around here.

350
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,882
You're not the bad guy.

351
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,551
(stammers)

352
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,551
Kids need boundaries.

353
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,927
That is easy

354
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,054
for you to say.

355
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,054
I am the only one doing it,

356
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,098
and then everyone

357
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,098
resents me for it.

358
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,807
Hey, you're not the only one.

359
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,768
Just today, Georgie and Sheldon

360
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,768
were fighting,

361
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,770
and I totally took care of it.

362
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,730
Really? What was going on?

363
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:09,025
They... you know, boy stuff.

364
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,151
I...

365
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:13,154
Don't worry. I got your back.

366
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,699
Thank you. That means a lot.

367
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,785
Teamwork, babe.

368
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:23,831
Look, right...

369
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,875
here.

370
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,128
That's my mom?

371
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,128
(chuckles)

372
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:32,173
Yep, the little queen

373
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:32,173
of darkness.

374
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,051
Is she smoking

375
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,051
a cigarette?

376
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,346
Yep. Probably stole it from me.

377
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,348
When did she stop being cool?

378
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,059
Well, first of all,

379
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,059
smoking is not cool.

380
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,978
You do it.

381
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,978
Yeah, well, next time

382
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,105
I'm hocking up some black goo

383
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,105
out of my lung,

384
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,524
I'll call you over

385
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,524
and you can see how cool it is.

386
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,152
Awesome.

387
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,152
It is not awesome.

388
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,404
And as far as your mom,

389
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,404
I think things started

390
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,574
to turn around for her

391
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,574
when she gave birth to you.

392
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,409
You mean me and Sheldon.

393
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,119
No, I mean you.

394
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,581
I mean, Sheldon was born fine,

395
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,581
but you were a different story.

396
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:05,915
Why?

397
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,834
Okay.

398
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:12,839
Well, there was a point

399
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:12,839
where the doctors didn't know

400
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,549
if you were gonna make it.

401
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,636
And your mom got so scared,

402
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,636
and she made a promise to God

403
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:22,223
that if you were okay,

404
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:22,223
that she would start reading

405
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:25,310
the Bible, going to church...

406
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,646
you know, that kind of stuff.

407
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,981
So I'm the reason she's a dud?

408
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,690
Your takeaway should be

409
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:35,778
that you are the reason she's

410
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:35,778
such a good mom, which she is.

411
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,322
And the next time

412
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,322
you hurt her feelings--

413
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,199
which you will--

414
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,537
you might remember

415
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,537
how much you mean to her.

416
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,832
Now I feel bad.

417
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,795
Good.

All right, get your butts

440
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,128
out to the gym.

441
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,631

00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,013
Come on, Jason,

444
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,013
I'm gonna be late.

445
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,306
Poor baby.

446
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,392
(Jason chuckles)

447
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,729
Excuse me.

448
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,439
I'd like to ask you

449
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,439
some questions

450
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,858
about your use of intimidation

451
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,858
to dominate others.

452
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,532
Are you trying

453
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,532
to get your ass kicked?

454
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:06,536
No, I was just looking to open

455
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:06,536
a spirited dialogue.

456
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,329
And you might want to unhand me.

457
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,498
I'm friends with Tommy Clarkson.

458
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,750
Is that so?

459
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,209
Yes.

460
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:15,962
Hello, Tommy.

461
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,589
I have some unfortunate news.

462
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,299
What's that?

463
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,299
I boasted

464
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,092
to Jason Davies

465
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,092
that you're my friend,

466
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,885
and things took

467
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,885
an unexpected turn.

468
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,554
You're scheduled to

469
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,554
fight him at 3:00 p.m.

470
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,473
on the basketball court.

471
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,726
I don't want

472
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,726
to fight Jason Davies.

473
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:32,811
I don't think you have a choice.

474
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:32,811
He was pretty adamant.

475
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:36,065
Fine, I'll deal with it.

476
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,693
You do have the option

477
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,693
of simply not showing up.

478
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,070
That's not

479
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,070
how fights work, Sheldon.

480
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,948
Why? Do they take attendance?

481
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,993
(clock ticking)

482
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,627
What on Earth did you say

483
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,627
to Missy?

484
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,087
Why? What'd she do now?

485
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,087
Nothing,

486
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,339
she was an angel.

487
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,757
I dropped her off at school,

488
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,384
and she hugged me

489
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,384
in front of her friends.

490
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,136
Really?

491
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,136
And not just

492
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,136
any friends.

493
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,889
Heather M. was there,

494
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,889
and that is a big deal.

495
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,225
I just gave her

496
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,225
a little life advice.

497
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,686
Like what?

498
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,522
Nothing, just grandma stuff.

499
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:20,360
There you go again,

500
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:20,360
being the good guy.

501
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,112
Mary, you need to know

502
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:26,407
you're doing a fantastic job

503
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:26,407
with those kids.

504
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,827
You really mean that?

505
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,454
I really do.

506
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,454
Thanks.

507
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:36,125
I can't remember the last time

508
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:36,125
someone said I was a good mom.

509
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:41,130
It's not a job that gets

510
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:41,130
a lot of compliments.

511
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:48,763
TAM: Look at this, my

512
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:48,763
mother left me a note.

513
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:52,517
"You can do better. Mom."

514
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,269
Not "Love, Mom,"

515
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,269
not "XO, Mom,"

516
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,813
just "Mom."

Well, I did.

You're not fighting Tommy,

556
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:09,469
you're fighting me.

558
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,054
Oh, boy.

559
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,640
Unless you want to shake hands

560
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,935
and we all laugh about this

561
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,935
over a glass of milk.

562
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,604
I think I'd rather kick

563
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,604
both your asses.

564
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,731
I was afraid you'd say that.

565
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,357
Are you familiar with the story

566
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,319
of David and Goliath

567
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,319
from the Bible?

568
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,654
Yeah.

569
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,489
That's too bad.

570
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,783
I had a nice speech prepared.

571
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,494
I'll say it anyway.

572
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,037
You may have

573
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,037
the size advantage,

574
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,748
but like David and his sling,

575
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,126
I also possess an

576
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,126
air-based weapon.

577
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,756
So I'll give you

578
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,756
one more chance.

579
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,716
Are you willing to step down?

580
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:49,926
(students exclaiming)

581
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,761
I'll tell you what:

582
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:56,015
you take the first shot,

583
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:56,015
then it's my turn.

584
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,058
Very well.

585
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,811
(rubber creaking)

586
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,145
Three...

587
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,815
...two...

588
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,319
...one.

589
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:19,204
Ow! Son of a bitch!

590
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,123
(laughter, cheering)

591
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,335
(growls)

592
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,339
I'm going to run.

593
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,596
ADULT SHELDON:

594
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,596
<i>Conventional wisdom tells us</i>

595
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,932
<i>that when one stands up</i>

596
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,932
<i>to a bully, the bully</i>

597
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,267
<i>will inevitably back down and</i>

598
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,267
<i>respect you for your courage.</i>

599
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,520
<i>My experience</i>

600
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,520
<i>suggests otherwise.</i>

601
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,481
SHELDON:

602
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,481
Hello? Hello?

603
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,233
ADULT SHELDON:

604
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,233
<i>When Jason finally caught me,</i>

605
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,110
<i>he had the good sense not</i>

606
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,110
<i>to commit assault and battery.</i>

607
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,654
<i>This did not, however,</i>

608
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,654
<i>prevent him</i>

609
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,948
<i>from imprisoning me</i>

610
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,948
<i>in his locker.</i>

611
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,534
Anybody?

612
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,452
<i>That was a very long night.</i>

613
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,621
It doesn't smell good in here.

614
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,040
<i>Very long.</i>

<i>I ever received</i>

00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:09,885

11
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:20,187

INGRAM:

14
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,730
Good job, Cooper.

15
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,524
That's just sad, Cooper.

00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,903

MEEMAW:

22
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,832
Hey, moonpie.

23
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,041
Ready to go?

24
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,417
Look at this.

25
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,712
95? That's terrific.

26
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,006
No. If it was terrific,

27
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,006
it would say 100

28
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,966
with the word "terrific"

29
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,966
next to it.

30
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,385
Don't sweat it, you'll

31
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,385
get 100 next time.

32
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,178
But I should have

33
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,178
gotten it this time.

34
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,514
Dr. Sturgis made a mistake.

35
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,350
And we're sweatin' it.

36
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:02,563
Dr. Sturgis, I believe you've

37
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:02,563
made an error grading my test.

38
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,232
Let me see.

39
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:10,111
No, you didn't calculate

40
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:10,111
using Maxwell's equations.

41
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,073
Maxwell's equation

42
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,073

(music playing over radio)

44
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,950
You like Willie Nelson?

45
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,952
That would require

46
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,952
knowing the permeability

47
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,286
of free space and natural units.

48
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,413
(music volume increases)

49
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,413
I suppose...

50
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,373
I like Willie Nelson.

51
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,918
...an electric field,

52
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,918
but that would still require...

I need to run

00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,566
Sunday's bulletin

62
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,861
by Pastor Jeff.

63
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,861
Is he in?

64
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,861
(Jeff coughing)

65
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,529
Yep.

(coughing continues)

67
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,115
Is he coming down

00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,115

00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,701
Yep. (coughs)

70
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,413
Oh, my, are you sick, too?

71
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:04,083
(coughing): Never better.

72
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,251
Okay.

73
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,169
Hello.

74
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,338
Oh, hey, Mary, come on in.

75
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,967
(sniffles)

76
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,967
I-I'm fine here.

77
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,052
Um, I have

78
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,052
Sunday's bulletin

79
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:17,012
for your approval.

80
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:17,012
And I wanted to ask about

81
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,180
ordering the palms

82
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,180
for Palm Sunday.

83
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,725
I know it's early, but as

84
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,725
you remember last year,

85
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,061
we waited too long and

86
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,061
First United Methodist

87
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:25,437
snatched up all

88
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:25,437
the perky ones.

89
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,480
(sniffles, groans)

90
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,982
Ooh.

91
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:31,026
Should you be here right now?

92
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:31,026
You look terrible.

93
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,778
I feel terrible.

94
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,114
Well, then go home,

95
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,114
let your wife take care of you.

96
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,741
You'd think she'd do that,

97
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,741
but no.

98
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,077
Ooh. Well, you should

99
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,077
at least go see a doctor.

100
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:43,371
I can't. The Walker couple

101
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:43,371
is coming in for counseling.

102
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,875
If you rescheduled,

103
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,875
I'm sure they'd understand.

104
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,377
Hey, what if you did it?

105
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,630
Marriage counseling?

106
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:55,009
Don't you need some sort

107
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:55,009
of training for that?

108
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,094
Nah, you just listen, uh,

109
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:58,929
give 'em a couple prayers,

110
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:58,929
send 'em on their way.

111
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:02,474
Okay, if you really want me to.

112
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:02,474
I do.

113
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:06,561
In fact, for the rest

114
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:06,561
of the day, you're in charge.

115
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,940
All right? The bulletins,

116
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,940
the palms, it's all you.

117
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,942
Well, all right, um,

118
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:14,653
but only if you promise to

119
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:14,653
go home and get some rest.

120
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:20,034
Sure. Home, movie theater,

121
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:20,034
food court, somewhere.

122
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:23,495
(groaning)

123
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,499
Today we're gonna work on

124
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,499
interior angles

125
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,334
of a convex polygon.

126
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,628
Georgie, where's your brother?

127
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,089
I don't know,

128
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,089
do you really want him here?

129
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,092
Convex polygons are polygons...

130
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,428
Sheldon, why aren't you

131
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,428
in second period?

132
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,556
I'm working on

133
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,556
this math problem.

134
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,641
I think you might be the

135
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,641
first person in history

136
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,227
who's ever cut

137
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,227
class to do math.

138
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,063
The irony wasn't lost on me.

139
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:52,232
Oh, hey, 95. Good job.

140
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,234
Really? I'm here every day

141
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,986
and it's like

142
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,986
you don't know me at all.

143
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,155
Oh, okay. Um...

144
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:02,534
aw, 95, too bad.

145
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,078
There we go.

146
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,459
Anything you can tell

147
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,459
me about the Walkers?

148
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,254
Not really,

149
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,254
just a couple of newlyweds

150
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,423
trying to figure it out.

151
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,591
Well, marriage is hard.

152
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,634
I'll never know.

153
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,634
Oh...

154
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,969
don't think that way.

155
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,596
I'm sure there's someone

156
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,596
out there for you.

157
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,098
Oh, no, that's not the problem.

158
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,768
I just don't want to waste this

159
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,768
on just one guy.

160
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,228
Sorry we're late.

161
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,812
Someone couldn't decide

162
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,812
on a hat.

163
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,606
Sorry.

164
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,606
Oh, that's all right.

165
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,943
Hi, I'm Mary Cooper, I'm gonna

166
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,943
be doing your session today.

167
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,486
Oh, what happened

168
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,486
to Pastor Jeff?

169
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,989
He's out sick and asked me

170
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,989
to fill in.

171
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:44,034
Oh, okay.

172
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:44,034
But don't worry,

173
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,745
you're in good hands.

174
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,745
I've been married for 15 years

175
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,247
and whatever

176
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,247
you're going through,

177
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,664
I'm sure I've been through it

178
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,664
several times.

179
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,291
PEG:

180
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,291
Francine?

181
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,502
I dig your hat.

182
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,502
(coughs)

183
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,421
So when we

184
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,421
first started dating,

185
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,799
he would plan these elaborate

186
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,799
picnics by the lake--

187
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,218
you know, like a real picnic

188
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,218
with the red and white blanket.

189
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,221
Oh, gingham, sweetie,

190
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,221
it's called gingham.

191
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,221
Yeah.

192
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,431
And after you got married,

193
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,268
all the picnics

194
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,268
and wooing ended?

195
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,560
No, no, not at all. No.

196
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,437
In fact, Elliot's more dotin'

197
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,437
than ever.

198
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,855
He knows that tulips

199
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,855
are my favorite,

200
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,857
so every week there's

201
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,857
a fresh-cut bouquet

202
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,400
on my nightstand.

203
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,820
I own the flower shop

204
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,820
across from the post office.

205
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,990
Well, y'all seem hunky-dory.

206
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,825
I'm confused, what's the issue?

207
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:30,664
Well, um, we're having trouble

208
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:30,664
in the, you know...

209
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,707
(whispers):

210
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,707
The bedroom.

211
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,543
Oh.

212
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,672
(dialing)

213
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,672
Sheldon, what are you

214
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,672
doing here?

215
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:42,259
They wouldn't let me use the

216
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:42,259
phone in the principal's office.

217
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:43,885
(line ringing)

218
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:43,885
Who are you calling?

219
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,513
Dr. Sturgis--

220
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,513
it's a math emergency.

221
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,848
(scoffs)

222
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,848
Don't you think

223
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,390
you should've asked

224
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,390
my permission first?

225
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,350
It's ringing. Yes or no?

226
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,979
You know what? I don't care.

227
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,148
STURGIS:

228
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,148
Hello?

229
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,194
Dr. Sturgis, this is Sheldon.

230
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,194
You're wrong and I can prove it.

231
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,529
Is that so?

232
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,614
It is so.

233
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:09,452
All right, little man,

234
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:09,452
bring it on.

235
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,338
Go ahead, Sheldon, I'm all ears.

236
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,422
Well, when I'm done,

237
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,422
you're going to be all tears.

238
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,382
Okay, fellas,

239
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,382
let's keep it civil.

240
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,636
You claim that the only way to

241
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,636
calculate the magnetic field

242
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,472
in QCD units is using

243
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,472
Maxwell's equations,

244
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,059
but you're completely

245
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,059
discrediting energy density.

246
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,392
But you're still off.

247
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,644
By a factor of 3.54.

248
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,437
Which would seem

249
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,437
insignificant,

250
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,148
but when examined closely,

251
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,692
you realize that it's the

252
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,692
square root of four times pi.

253
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:41,985
Your point being?

254
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,737
Rationalized

255
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,737
and non-rationalized units

256
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,989
differ by four

257
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,989
times pi--

258
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,949
anyone with a basic knowledge

259
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,949
of electric

260
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,450
and magnetic fields

261
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,450
would know that.

262
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,619
I'm lost.

263
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,619
Are we still being civil?

264
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,871
It's all right, Connie.

265
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,749
Sheldon's trying to

266
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,749
justify his shortcut.

267
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,958
Not a shortcut,

268
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,793
a more elegant

269
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,793
and efficient method

270
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,461
to achieve the correct answer.

271
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,631
Well, I applaud the effort,

272
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,631
young man.

273
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:07,177
Don't treat me like a child,

274
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:07,177
treat me like a colleague.

275
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:12,224
Fine. This is the stupidest

276
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:12,224
thing I've ever seen.

277
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:16,644
How could you say that?!

278
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:16,644
(crying)

279
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,021
What are you doing?

280
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,023
Treating him like a colleague.

281
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,816
Do you and your colleagues

282
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,816
make each other

283
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,944
run out of the room

284
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,944
crying like that?

285
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,570
Sometimes.

286
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:30,033
But we run slower,

287
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:30,033
'cause we're old.

288
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:34,704
And then he said,

289
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:34,704
"For the rest of the day,

290
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,748
you're in charge."

291
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,748
Mm.

292
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,126
Those were his exact words.

293
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,126
Can you believe it?

294
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,543
"You're in charge."

295
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,045
Well, that's great.

296
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,045
And thanks to me,

297
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,965
this year United Methodist

298
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,965
is gonna get stuck

299
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,549
with all the limp palms.

300
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,552
Well, I don't know what

301
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,552
that means, but good for you.

302
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,845
I even did some

303
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,845
marriage counseling

304
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,347
for a couple of young newlyweds.

305
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,308
Ooh, what kind of trouble

306
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,308
they having?

307
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,893
Oh, it's all confidential;

308
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,893
I really can't say.

309
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,312
Well, I don't

310
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,312
need specifics,

311
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,272
just, you know, general terms.

312
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,150
They're having sexual problems.

313
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,318
Really?

314
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,153
Newlyweds?

315
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,362
But we all prayed on it

316
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,489
and then the answer came

317
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,489
clear as a bell.

318
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,865
Yeah?

319
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,701
The husband is under

320
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,701
a lot of stress at work

321
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,371
and it's diminishing

322
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,371
his natural desires.

323
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,415
Huh. What kind of work

324
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,415
does he do

325
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:19,916
he's got so much stress?

326
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,462
He owns that flower shop

327
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,462
across from the post office.

328
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,631
Flower shop. Huh.

329
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,092
You've seen it.

330
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,092
It's called The Pretty Petunia.

331
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,553
Huh.

332
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,605
GEORGE SR.:

333
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,605
So, Sheldon,

334
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,149
you and Dr. Sturgis figure out

335
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,484
your math emergency?

336
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,486
I'd rather not talk about it.

337
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,154
Me neither.

338
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,989
(phone ringing)

339
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,449
That's probably for me.

340
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,826
I'm really

341
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,826
getting popular.

342
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,495
What's a math emergency?

343
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,622
That's when things don't add up.

344
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,622
(chuckles)

345
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,622
MISSY: Hello?

346
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,792
Oh, come on, guys,

347
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,792
that was a good one.

348
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:03,960
MISSY: Mom, it's

349
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:03,960
Pastor Jeff!

350
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,587
Mm, excuse me.

351
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,589
To answer your

352
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,589
question, Georgie,

353
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,550
it's when a scientist

354
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,550
is too immature

355
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,052
to admit when he's wrong.

356
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,346
Maybe you're too immature.

357
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,764
MEEMAW:

358
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,764
Gentlemen, please.

359
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,809
I'm sorry, but when someone

360
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,809
with way less experience

361
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,478
accuses me

362
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,478
of not knowing

363
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,481
what I'm talking about,

364
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,481
my hackles are up.

365
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:25,899
What's a hackle?

366
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,484
Well, if he's wrong,

367
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,484
then teach him to be right

368
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,903
instead of berating him

369
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,903
like a big ol' jackass.

370
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,239
That's very hurtful!

371
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,206
(door closes)

372
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,206
Well, how 'bout that?

373
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,291
They do run slower.

374
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,045
Good news! I get to go

375
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,045
visit a shut-in.

376
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,839
What the hell is going on today?

377
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:59,474
GILFORD:

378
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:59,474
It's open.

379
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,892
MAN 1 (on TV):

380
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,892
What's up, Schultz?

381
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,936
MAN 2 (on TV):

382
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,936
Are you asking me? (chuckles)

383
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,564
Haven't you learned that I know

384
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,564
nothing, I see nothing...

385
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,191
Hello? Mr. Gilford?

386
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,528
Who are you?

387
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,114
Hi, I'm Mary Cooper

388
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,114
from the church.

389
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,490
Pastor Jeff is out sick,

390
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,451
so he asked me

391
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,451
to bring over your dinner.

392
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:21,121
Steak fingers?

393
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:21,121
With extra gravy.

394
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,290
Where's my Mr. Pibb?

395
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,334
Oh, right here.

396
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,086
You want me to

397
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,086
open it for you?

398
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,712
I've got hands.

399
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,966
Maybe while you eat

400
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,966
we could chat a little.

401
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:36,303
I'm old, I'm alone,

402
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:36,303
I'm gonna die soon.

403
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,847
There, we've chatted.

404
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,847
Okay.

405
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,850
If you're not in the mood

406
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,850
for conversation,

407
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,936
maybe there's something else

408
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,936
I could do for you.

409
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:49,107
Haven't had a sponge bath

410
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:49,107
in a while.

411
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:53,320
Does Pastor Jeff

412
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:53,320
give you a sponge bath?

413
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,779
Sure does.

414
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,365
Mr. Gilford.

415
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,618
No...

416
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:07,875
Lights out?

417
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:07,875
In a minute.

418
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,878
(sighs) I may not understand

419
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,878
exactly what's going on

420
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,714
with you and Dr. Sturgis, but

421
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,714
you can't be rude to an adult.

422
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,467
What if they're wrong?

423
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,927
Doesn't matter. There are plenty

424
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,927
of stupid people in the world,

425
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:21,097
but when they're older than you,

426
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:21,097
you got to show them respect.

427
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:26,936
I understand, sir. Thank you

428
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:26,936
for your incredibly wise advice.

429
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,606
Okay.

430
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,947
Did you just call Dad stupid

431
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,947
without calling him stupid?

432
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,491
Yes.

433
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,292
Here, let me get that.

434
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,003
And, uh, while

435
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,003
I'm cleaning up,

436
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,589
I could also tackle

437
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,589
some of, um...

438
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,509
Don't touch anything!

439
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,509
I like it the way it is.

440
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,470
Could I at least open a window,

441
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,470
get you some fresh air?

442
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:04,349
It's not necessary.

443
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:04,349
I've got some right here.

444
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,600
(inhales deeply)

445
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,728
Mind if I make some room to sit?

446
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,565
You're staying?

447
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,401
Yes, I'm staying. I'm here

448
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,401
to keep you company.

449
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,820
Why? So you'll look like

450
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,820
some kind of Good Samaritan?

451
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,324
Because God calls on us

452
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,324
to serve our fellow man.

453
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,743
Romans 12:13, "Share with

454
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,743
the Lord's people who are..."

455
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,914
What are you doing?

456
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,914
Quoting scripture.

457
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,957
Well, I don't want to hear that.

458
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,418
You don't want

459
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,418
to hear the Bible?

460
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,919
Not from some woman.

461
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,714
Excuse me?

462
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,714
Where have you been?

463
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,798
Women don't preach

464
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,798
in our church.

465
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,927
Well, I'm not in our church,

466
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,927
I'm in your living room,

467
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,513
which is, by the way,

468
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,513
disgusting.

469
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,896
I'm sorry I called

470
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,896
you a jackass.

471
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:55,650
(chuckles)

472
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:55,650
A "big, old jackass."

473
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:59,613
But it's okay, I deserved it.

474
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,615
Don't be too hard

475
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,615
on yourself.

476
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:05,243
Sheldon's always been

477
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:05,243
difficult to deal with.

478
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,662
I'm not upset

479
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,662
that he's difficult,

480
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,415
I'm upset that he's right.

481
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,042
Really?

482
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,336
And you're just now

483
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,336
saying something?

484
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:19,549
Energy density, rationalized

485
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:19,549
and non-rationalized units,

486
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,384
I can't believe I missed it.

487
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,345
Well, like you said,

488
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,345
everybody makes a mistake.

489
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,639
But it was so obvious.

490
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,184
A younger me

491
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,184
would've seen it.

492
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,853
I think I'm losing a step.

493
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,648
You're not alone.

494
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,734
The other night I had bingo for

495
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,734
five moves, didn't even know it.

496
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,403
(laughs) Were you drinking?

497
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,863
It's bingo, of course

498
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,863
I was drinking.

499
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:46,242
(both laugh)

500
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:46,242
Don't worry about it.

501
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:49,746
We'll lose a step together.

502
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,083
Thank you, Bonnie.

503
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,630
You see that?

504
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,630
I made a joke about it.

505
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:02,425
Never do it again.

506
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:02,425
Yes, ma'am.

507
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,931
Hey, Sheldon.

508
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,931
Hello.

509
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,058
You get that test problem

510
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,058
sorted out?

511
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,271
No, I'm afraid Dr. Sturgis and I

512
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,271
are still at a math impasse.

513
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:18,149
Oh, I hate those.

514
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:18,149
Thank you for asking.

515
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,444
I appreciate it.

516
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,444
And how are you doing?

517
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,904
Since when are you interested?

518
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,700
My father told me I should be

519
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,700
kind to old people.

520
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,577
How old do you think I am?

521
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:33,289
My father also told me

522
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:33,289
if a woman ever asks you that,

523
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,457
it's a trap.

524
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,584
Smart man.

525
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,295
But I'll say 53.

526
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,641
Peg, we got any more of those

527
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,641
fancy binder clips?

528
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,184
Bottom right drawer.

529
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,979
Oh! Um, hi.

530
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,481
Y...

531
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,525
You're back. Uh, feeling better?

532
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,235
No.

533
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,487
Then what are you doing here?

534
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,487
Why aren't you home in bed?

535
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,114
Because not everybody has

536
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,114
a happy marriage, Mary, okay?

537
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,158
Sorry.

538
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,911
How's everything

539
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,911
going around here?

540
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,331
Really well. I had a lovely

541
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,331
session with the Walkers.

542
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:19,043
I think that they're gonna be

543
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:19,043
fruitful and multiplying soon.

544
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,837
(chuckles)

545
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,837
And, um,

546
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,258
I had a visit with our shut-in,

547
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,258
Mr. Gilford.

548
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,885
He's quite the character,

549
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,885
isn't he?

550
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,721
That's a nice way to put it.

551
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,721
Yeah, well, you got to

552
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,848
give him a pass,

553
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,848
what with all he's been through.

554
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,558
What's he been through?

555
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,477
Mary, that man sitting all alone

556
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,477
in that mess of a house

557
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,979
is a genuine war hero.

558
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,775
People like you and me'll never

559
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,775
understand what he went through.

560
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,068
I didn't know.

561
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,363
Well, he sure won't talk about

562
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,363
it. He give you a hard time?

563
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:51,367
Yeah, and-and I kind of

564
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:51,367
gave him one right back.

565
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,037
Would you mind if I

566
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,037
went back over there

567
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,623
and gave it another go?

568
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,959
By all means. I got to lay down.

569
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,462
Hey, Peg, if my wife

570
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,462
calls, tell her--

571
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,506
You know what, oh,

572
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,506
she's not gonna call.

573
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:06,758
Never mind.

574
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,136
(coughing)

575
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:21,147
Mr. Gilford,

576
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:21,147
it's Mary Cooper again.

577
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,363
(TV playing)

578
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,363
Mr. Gilford?

579
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,658
(gasps)

580
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,076
Mr. Gilford?

581
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,830
(indistinct chatter)

582
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,001
(clears throat)

583
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,544
You a relative?

584
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,544
No.

585
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,712
Friend?

586
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,465
I was trying.

587
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:51,344
Okay, well, sorry.

588
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:51,344
Coroner's on his way.

589
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,971
Thank you.

590
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,264
This is some mess, huh?

591
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,852
(exhales)

592
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,852
It's how he liked it.

593
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,278
(knocking)

594
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,364
May I come in?

595
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,782
I guess.

596
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:22,375
I looked over your

597
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:22,375
work again and, uh,

598
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:24,794
the math was correct.

599
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,256
Really?

600
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,258
You were right...

601
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,971
and I was, uh, wrong.

602
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,848
Sorry I doubted you.

603
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,810
Wow. It must be really hard

604
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,810
for you to admit that.

605
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,562
Well, yes.

606
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:47,149
But, uh, I thought it could be

607
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:47,149
a learning opportunity for you.

608
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,609
What do you mean?

609
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,277
I wanted to show you

610
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,277
that being wrong

611
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,405
is not the end of the world.

612
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,950
Oh, okay. Thank you.

613
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,786
ADULT SHELDON:

614
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,786
<i>Dr. Sturgis was a wise man.</i>

615
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,955
<i>It was a learning opportunity.</i>

616
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,624
<i>And when the day comes</i>

617
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,624
<i>that I'm wrong,</i>

618
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,877
<i>I fully plan to admit it.</i>

619
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,591
Okay, before we finish up,

620
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,591
I'd like to call up Mary Cooper,

621
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,927
who has a few words

622
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,927
she'd like to say.

623
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,308
Thank you, Pastor Jeff.

624
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,563
(clears throat)

625
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,563
As some of you might know,

626
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,148
we lost a member

627
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,148
of our congregation.

628
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,110
James Gilford passed away

629
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,110
earlier this week.

630
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,195
If that name isn't

631
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,195
familiar to you,

632
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,656
don't feel bad, it

633
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,656
wasn't to me either.

634
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,909
But in the last few days,

635
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,244
I've gotten to learn

636
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,244
a little bit about him.

637
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:44,958
He was married to his wife,

638
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:44,958
Meredith, for over 45 years,

639
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,167
he was a lieutenant in the Army,

640
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,462
and, forgive him for this,

641
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,256
a big fan of the Dallas Cowboys.

642
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,008
(laughter)

643
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,761
But even if you didn't know him,

644
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,761
I hope that you'll still join me

645
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,305
in celebrating his life

646
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,305
this Wednesday

647
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,141
at the American Legion.

648
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,141
Thank you.

649
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:06,145
Oh, um, and if there's

650
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:06,145
anyone who's able

651
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,815
to help me clean out his house,

652
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,815
please let me know.

653
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:12,652
Ooh, you know I love to tackle

654
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:12,652
clutter. We'll do it!

655
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,571
Oh, thank you.

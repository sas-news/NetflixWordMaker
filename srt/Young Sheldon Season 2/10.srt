<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...

2
00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:02,878
Paige?

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,755
I'm so happy to see you.

4
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:06,214
Are you happy to see me?

5
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,175
Not immediately.

6
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,385
I don't usually see young people

7
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,385
at my lectures.

8
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:13,305
I enjoyed your paper on

9
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:13,305
accelerator mass spectrometry

10
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,723
and wanted to find out more.

11
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:17,309
And you?

12
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:17,309
I read this magazine.

13
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,770
Uh-huh.

14
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,770
It has puzzles, too.

15
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:21,689
Well, I think my parents

16
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:21,689
are getting a divorce.

17
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,358
Why?

18
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,358
They fight all the time.

19
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,319
I guess I'm lucky.

20
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,319
Why?

21
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,322
I'm the glue that holds

22
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,322
our family together.

23
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,079
(Meemaw chuckles)

24
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,000
What do you think of these?

25
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,210
They're nice, but you're

26
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,210
already taller than John.

27
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,586
Won't they make that worse?

28
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,630
No, makes it better.

29
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,256
He likes me to be dominating.

30
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,258
I don't want to hear that.

31
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,555
Sometimes he makes me wear these

32
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,555
when we're... messing around.

33
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,891
I said I don't

34
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,891
want to hear it.

35
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,267
I wanted to say it.

36
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,521
All right, I don't have the

37
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,521
Sperry loafers in your size,

38
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,690
but I do have the Hush Puppies.

39
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:07,067
I don't wear brown Hush

40
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:07,067
Puppies penny loafers,

41
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,444
I wear brown Sperry

42
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,444
penny loafers.

43
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,488
But they're exactly the same.

44
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,488
Well, do they come

45
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,323
in a box that says

46
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,323
Sperry penny loafers?

47
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,909
Because that one

48
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,909
says Hush Puppies.

49
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,994
Just try 'em on, honey.

50
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:19,872
What if I like them?

51
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:19,872
Well, then we'll get them.

52
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,165
All right, let's go

53
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,165
over this again.

54
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,418
I don't wear brown Hush

55
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,418
Puppies penny loafers,

56
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,920
I wear brown Sperry...

57
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,254
Would you give us a moment?

58
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,048
Happily.

59
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,090
When we get to

60
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,090
the Hello Kitty store today,

61
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,218
remember I was the good child.

62
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,803
Oh, hi, Mary.

63
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,764
Linda. So good to see you.

64
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,098
Hi, Sheldon.

65
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,098
Hello, Paige.

66
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,935
Hi, Missy.

67
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,935
Hi!

68
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,645
Look at these rain boots--

69
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,645
they have ducks on them.

70
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,647
And the ducks

71
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,647
are wearing boots.

72
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,482
Those are so cute.

73
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,650
(Paige giggling)

74
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,819
Well, what a nice coincidence.

75
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,819
Yeah.

76
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:51,779
Good to see you.

77
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,947
Yeah. How are things?

78
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,155
Well, at the moment,

79
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,616
trying to get shoes for Sheldon,

80
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,160
but they only have these,

81
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,160
not the ones he likes.

82
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:04,666
Ah. You know, I think that brand

83
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:04,666
is the same kind Einstein wore.

84
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,377
Well, I've never seen a picture

85
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,377
of his feet.

86
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,130
And you're a grown-up,

87
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,130
so you wouldn't lie to me.

88
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,717
I guess I have no choice

89
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,717
but to believe you.

90
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,385
All right, I'll try them.

91
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:18,055
Great! (mouths)

92
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:21,141
Hey, Mom, can Missy and I go

93
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:21,141
to the Hello Kitty store?

94
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,644
Well, it's okay with me

95
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,644
if it's okay with Mary.

96
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,563
It's okay, but you better be

97
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,563
on your best behavior.

98
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:27,815
I will, I promise.

99
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,983
Go ahead.

100
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,693
Boy, you steal

101
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,693
one pencil sharpener

102
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,737
and you never hear

103
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,737
the end of it.

104
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,658
How do they feel?

105
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,453
My brand loyalty is being

106
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,453
severely tested.

107
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:46,166

114
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,646
Did you guys know Paige

115
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,646
speaks three languages?

116
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,357
Really?

117
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,357
That's impressive.

118
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,526
You only speak one.

119
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,737
Two. I'm learning

120
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,737
conversational Klingon.

121
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,196
That's impressive, too.

122
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,158
(speaks in Klingon)

123
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,535
Hey, Mom, can Paige

124
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,535
sleep over this weekend?

125
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,871
I guess,

126
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,871
if her mother says okay.

127
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,040
Wait, where is she

128
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,040
going to sleep?

129
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,083
In your bed.

130
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,083
You can sleep on the couch.

131
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,459
Absolutely not.

132
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,252
I've already changed

133
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,252
my brand of loafers,

134
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,506
I am not changing

135
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,506
my sleeping quarters.

136
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,758
How about you stay at

137
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,758
Meemaw's? You like that.

138
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,802
No, Meemaw has a date.

139
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:39,845
So?

140
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,180
So if those shoes I just bought

141
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,639
do their job,

142
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,683
that will be a "no children

143
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,683
allowed" scenario.

144
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,979
Well, I'm sleeping in my bed,

145
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,979
and that's that.

146
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,231
Fine, Paige and I

147
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,231
can share my bed.

148
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,900
You okay with that, Shelly?

149
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,778
I trust you two will stay quiet

150
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,778
throughout the evening

151
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,613
and go to sleep at

152
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,613
the appropriate time?

153
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,158
Absolutely.

154
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,869
All right, then.

155
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,869
I'm okay with it, Mom.

156
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:07,831
How is he ever gonna

157
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:07,831
get through this world?

158
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,794
(knocking)

159
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,794
Welcome, come on in.

160
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,838
Oh, thank you.

161
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,423
You look nice. Going out

162
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,423
to dinner with your husband?

163
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:19,218
Ugh, no. Girlfriends.

164
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,468
Hi, Sheldon.

165
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,887
Hello.

166
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,097
What are you doing?

167
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,015
Chemistry homework

168
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,015
for extra credit.

169
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,808
Cute, I did that last year.

170
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,560
MISSY:

171
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,560
Paige!

172
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,478
Missy!

173
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,773
Aw, they're so sweet.

174
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,235
Yeah, life'll suck that

175
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,235
right out of them soon enough.

176
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,778
Well, bye.

177
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,778
Bye.

178
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,989
You got to meet my dolls--

179
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,989
I told them all about you!

180
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,825
(giggling)

181
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:47,287
"Cute, I did that last year."

182
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,497
Thank you for agreeing

183
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,497
to the early-bird dinner.

184
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:53,585
When I eat too late,

185
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:53,585
the food just sits right here.

186
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,130
Yeah, gettin' old

187
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,130
is no party.

188
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,340
Oh, I've had this problem

189
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,340
since I was ten.

190
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:04,221
When I was in grade school,

191
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:04,221
my nickname was Old Burpy.

192
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:07,015
Well, I will not be

193
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:07,015
calling you that.

194
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,225
You can if you'd like.

195
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,810
(chuckles):

196
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,810
I'm good.

197
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,437
So, I have a little surprise

198
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,437
for you.

199
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,731
Oh, I love surprises.

200
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,731
Whatcha got?

201
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,566
I'm going to learn to drive.

202
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,359
Really?

203
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,778
Yes.

204
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,115
While I love having you be

205
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,115
the dominant personality

206
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:26,493
behind closed doors,

207
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:26,493
I think out in public

208
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,495
I ought to take on

209
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,495
more of a macho role.

210
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,788
(laughs)

211
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,749
Well, you're macho enough

212
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,749
for me, John,

213
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,211
but I would enjoy not having

214
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,211
to drive us all the time.

215
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,462
Then it's settled.

216
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,131
Well, when do you start?

217
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,757
As soon as you teach me.

218
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:44,845
Me? Do you really think

219
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:44,845
that's a good idea?

220
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:48,182
It's perfect.

221
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:48,182
I teach you about science

222
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,850
so you can impress

223
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,850
your grandson,

224
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,854
and you teach me to drive

225
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,854
so I can impress you.

226
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:58,483
Okay, but if we do this,

227
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:58,483
I'm in charge.

228
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:03,488
You have to do what I say when

229
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:03,488
and how I tell you to do it.

230
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,408
Hubba-hubba, it's like

231
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,408
we're back in the bedroom.

232
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,952
(both laughing)

233
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:12,539
Did you know that tea was

234
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:12,539
discovered by accident?

235
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,125
I didn't, but I don't know

236
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,125
lots of stuff.

237
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,752
The Emperor Shennong of China

238
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,752
was boiling water in his garden

239
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,421
and a leaf from a tea tree

240
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,421
fell into his pot.

241
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,632
Tea comes from trees?

242
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,010
Where'd you think

243
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,010
it comes from?

244
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,055
The supermarket.

245
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,055
(chuckles)

246
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,141
What, the girls leave you out

247
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,141
of their little picnic?

248
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,600
Oh, they invited him.

249
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,061
Well, then why ain't you

250
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,061
out there?

251
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:37,231
Eat outdoors? Do I look

252
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:37,231
like a hippie to you?

253
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,066
I thought Paige

254
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,066
was your friend.

255
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,817
She's more of a colleague.

256
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,818
Oh.

257
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,195
Although for reasons unknown,

258
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,446
she's currently behaving

259
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,446
like a ten-year-old.

260
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,824
Maybe that's because she

261
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,824
is a ten-year-old.

262
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,243
Still no excuse.

263
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,080
All right, I'm just gonna

264
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,080
come out and ask it:

265
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,540
what the heck

266
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,540
is a colleague?

267
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,381
Okay, pick a number.

268
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,506
Three.

269
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,384
PAIGE:

270
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,384
One, two, three.

271
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,843
Now pick a color.

272
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,178
Pink, duh.

273
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,974
The name of

274
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,974
your future pony is...

275
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,851
Sparkle Sunshine.

276
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,145
I would totally name it that!

277
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,898
Sheldon, do you want to

278
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,898
have your fortune read?

279
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,608
Absolutely not.

280
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,778
And I cannot believe a person

281
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,778
as smart as you is doing it.

282
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,863
Why? It's fun.

283
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,242
He doesn't know how to have fun;

284
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,242
he's an old man.

285
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,618
I'm not an old man.

286
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,870
Oh, yeah?

287
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,870
What's your favorite color?

288
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,163
Khaki.

289
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,498
Old man.

290
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,498
(chuckles)

291
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:45,173
(Paige and Missy giggling)

292
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,175
I'm trying to sleep.

293
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,094
Come inside and play with us.

294
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,429
MISSY:

295
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,429
Don't invite him.

296
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,638
This is a girls' fort,

297
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,140
not an old man fort.

298
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,392
I'm not an old man.

299
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:56,726
Then come inside.

300
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,770
Are you crazy? It's bedtime.

301
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,606
Old man.

302
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,442
(Paige and Missy laughing)

303
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,162
(snoring softly)

304
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,710
(whispering):

305
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,710
What are you doing?

306
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,213
(whispering): We're tying

307
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,213
Georgie's ankles together.

308
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,924
(whispering): So when he gets

309
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,924
out of bed he falls down.

310
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,468
But he could get hurt.

311
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,052
If we're lucky.

312
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,429
Well, I will not be

313
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,429
a party to this.

314
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:35,097
Old man.

315
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,890
(giggles)

316
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:42,647
That's when

317
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:42,647
the bloodthirsty Goatman--

318
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,691
part goat, part man--

319
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:49,196
crept up on the

320
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:49,196
sleeping children...

321
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:49,196
No.

322
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:53,992
...and sank his sharp little

323
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:53,992
teeth into their necks...

324
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:53,992
No.

325
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,203
...and drank their blood!

326
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,829
No.

327
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,331
Problem?

328
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,624
Several. First of all,

329
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,624
goats are herbivores.

330
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,918
They don't eat meat,

331
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,918
let alone drink blood.

332
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,087
Maybe the half man part

333
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,087
drinks blood.

334
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,257
Don't even get me started

335
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,257
on the "half man" stuff.

336
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,844
Sheldon, it's just

337
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,844
a fun scary story.

338
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,721
It's nonsense is what it is.

339
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:15,972
Old man.

340
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,765
I'm not an old man, I'm ten.

341
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,393
More like 110.

342
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,729
You know, I read that adults

343
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,729
who had a stunted childhood

344
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,399
often become social misfits

345
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,399
and weirdos.

346
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,983
You didn't read that,

347
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,983
you're making it up

348
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,485
like your goat story.

349
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:32,989

351

Well, um...

352
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,784
That doesn't make it true.

353
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,703
Guess you'll find out

354
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,703
when you're an adult.

355
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,705
I guess I will.

What?

372
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,319
Paige was right.

373
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,321
"There's ample evidence

374
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,321
to indicate

375
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,491
"that a stunted childhood

378
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,993
Then I'm screwed.

What do you mean?

380
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,248
When I'm not in school,

381
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,248
I'm doing homework.

382
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,000
When I'm not doing homework,

383
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm practicing my cello.

384
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,461
And when I'm not doing that,

385
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,337
I'm working

386
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,337
in my parents' store.

387
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,798
That must be why we're friends.

388
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,091
We're both stunted.

389
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,509
Sounds right.

390
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,512
Well, I for one

391
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,512
plan to do something about it.

392
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,264
Like what?

393
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,267
I'm going to goof off,

394
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,267
engage in horseplay,

395
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,603
and if time permits,

396
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,603
be quite immature.

397
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,020
If time permits?

398
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,148
I have homework, too.

399
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,191
Would you like to join me

400
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,191
in my shenanigans?

401
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,776
No, thanks.

402
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:55,113
Aren't you concerned about

403
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:55,113
being a maladjusted adult?

404
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,740
Nah. I'll just marry

405
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,740
an American woman

406
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,327
and hope she can fix me.

407
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,792
I'm usually the one

408
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,792
giving the tests,

409
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:11,045
but, uh, today I'm<i> taking</i> one.

410
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,339
No talking.

411
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,926
And I usually say that

412
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,926
to my students.

413
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,014
(mouthing)

414
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,015
What?

415
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,017
(quietly):

416
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,017
How's it going?

417
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:27,103
I can't tell you.

418
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:27,103
There's no talking.

419
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,897
No talking.

420
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,897
Sorry.

421
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,032
Mind if I join you?

422
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:39,991
Doing what?

423
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,410
Swinging.

424
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,410
Seriously?

425
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,163
Yes. It's my hope to feel

426
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,163
the wind in my hair

427
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,706
and be carefree.

428
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,706
Um, okay.

429
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:55,173

Sheldon threw up on me.

432
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,891
Sheldon threw up on me!

433
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:09,937
Okay, rearview mirrors.

434
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,148
Um, all set.

436
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,943
Turn signal right.

437
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,655
Um, foot on the brake.

438
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:22,325
Transmission in drive.

439
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,956
You have to start

440
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,956
the car first.

441
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,125
Of course.

442
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,627
Sorry, I'm a bit nervous.

443
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,337
You're not alone.

445
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,051

I'm doing it.

449
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,324

It's okay, we're fine.

Nobody got hurt.

I don't think I can

No, it's too much information.

I can't process it.

483
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,480
It was just a yellow light.

484
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,566
Not just the light.

485
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,566
There were other cars.

486
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:19,818
There's pedestrians.

487
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,445
There was a guy on a bicycle.

488
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,445
So?

489
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,197

Oh, don't be silly.

498
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,002

you can drive or not.

You love me?

Well, I...

504
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,519
I suppose I do.

507
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,861
Sure, if that's

508
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,861
the way you feel.

510
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,987
Oh, it is.

511
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,281
I love you, too, Connie.

513
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,451
Well...

514
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,873
That's just great.

switch seats with me?

519
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,715
Yes, but give me a minute

520
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:26,509
because my legs are

521
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:26,509
a little wobbly.

522
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,637
Is that from the yellow light

523
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,637
or the "I love yous"?

524
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,971
Both.

No, thank you.

there's a rattling sound,

548
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,515

00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,902
"Is Mrs. Wall there?"

581
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,487
And then you would say, "No."

582
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,906
And then I would say,

583
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,906
"Well, if there are no walls,

584
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:15,034
then how does your roof

585
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:15,034
stay up?"

586
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:18,119
Um, okay. Bazinga.

587
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,624
That was pathetic.

588
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,459
It was.

589
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:27,171
I'm not sure I'm cut out for

590
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:27,171
these antics and shenanigans.

591
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,674
I guess you're gonna

592
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,674
grow up to be a weirdo.

593
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,968
I suppose I am.

594
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,178
Life is so confusing.

595
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,264
I always hoped

596
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,264
it would be easier for me

597
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,892
when I grew up, but...

598
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,021
...now I'm not so sure it will.

599
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,356
It's gonna be all right.

600
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,858
(loud flatulence sound)

601
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,032
You were faking?

602
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,411
Bazinga.

603
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,120
ADULT SHELDON:

604
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,120
<i>And that's how I became</i>

605
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:04,042
<i>the madcap prankster</i>

606
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:04,042
<i>all my friends know and love.</i>

607
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,882
So, John, how was

608
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,882
your first driving lesson?

609
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,967
(exhales)

610
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,967
Intense.

611
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,093
At one point,

612
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,220
I was approaching

613
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,220
an intersection.

614
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,973
The light was green,

615
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,973
but at the last moment,

616
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,433
it turned yellow.

617
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,642
I didn't know what to do.

618
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,395
Should I keep going?

619
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,395
Should I stop?

620
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,564
There were

621
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,564
other cars nearby.

622
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:27,815
Connie was yelling.

623
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,276
A glare from the sun

624
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,276
was in my eyes.

625
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,569
So, what happened?

626
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,780
Somehow, I managed

627
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,780
to make it through,

628
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,656
turned on my directional,

629
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,324
and slowly pulled

630
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,368
to the side of the road.

631
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,372
(exhales) That's how you

632
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,372
tell a scary story.

633
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,418
In lighter news,

634
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,418
your meemaw loves me.

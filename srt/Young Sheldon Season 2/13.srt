I'm gettin' baptized tomorrow.

(sighs heavily)

107
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,432
I'm curious about

108
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,432
more cost-effective methods

109
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,434
of generating electricity.

110
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,645
And?

111
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,438
And I came to you. Go.

112
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,484
Well, there's fossil fuels,

113
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,484
like oil and coal.

114
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,402
Too dirty.

115
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,402
Oh. Hydro?

116
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,030

00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,030

120
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,078
You know what the problem

121
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,078
with wind is.

122
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,371
It's too reliant on wind.

123
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,664
I think I'm looking

124
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,833

125
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,833

126
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,250
How about nuclear power?

127
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,336
It's clean and efficient

128
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,336
and very safe,

129
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,006
until something goes

130
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,006
horribly wrong.

131
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,842
That could work.

132
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,426
Oh. Goody.

133
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,970
Are we done?

134
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:43,431
Almost. I have one last question

135
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:43,431
about nuclear reactors.

136
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,017
What?

137
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,435
How do I build one? Go.

Wait, wait.

160
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,806
Hang on there, partner. I need

161
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,806
a little more information.

162
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,516

163
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,768

164
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,977
Oh. What time?

165
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,270
I'm not sure.

166
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,772
Well, will there be food?

167
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:32,981
I have no idea.

168
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,233
What's the dress code?

169
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,525
Not a clue.

170

You're my plus-one.

172
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:42,323
Well, you go do a little more

173
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:42,323
research and get back to me.

174
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,492
You got it!

175
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,492
Bye.

176
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,203
Wait.

177
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,203
What?

178
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,454
Love you!

179
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,123

00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:56,213
Hello. Is this the studio that

182

makes the<i> Professor Proton</i> show?

183
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:57,464
Excellent.

184
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,841
May I speak to him, please?

185
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,261
Well, then I'd like

186
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,261
to leave him a message.

187
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,721
My name is Sheldon Cooper,

188
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,721
and I'm trying to build

189
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,933
a nuclear reactor,

190
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,933
and I could use his help.

191
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:11,603
My number is 409-356-6049.

192
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,815
Thank you.

193
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,815
I'm gonna hang up now,

194
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,108
because this is long-distance,

195
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,152
and my father

196
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,152
doesn't make much money.

197
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,402
Good-bye.

198
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,779
(door opens)

199
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,615
Georgie, question:

200
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,159
In the hallway

201
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,159
earlier today,

202
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,953
were you upset or hungry?

203
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,289
Shut up.

204
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,709
That's hungry.

205
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,878
STURGIS:

206
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,878
<i>Connie, I believe</i>

207
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,878
<i>I have answers</i>

208
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,797
to all your questions.

209
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,174
Lay it on me.

210
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,884
Time: the event begins

211
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,884
at 6:00 p.m.

212
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,804
The dress code is:

213
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,804
business attire.

214
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,098
Dinner will be served,

215
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,098
but it's been suggested

216
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,101
that we eat first,

217
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,101
because the food is dreadful.

218
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,477
Good to know.

219
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,895
And last but not least,

220
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,481
a camelid is any member

221
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,481
of the camelidae family,

222
00:05:56,523 --> 00:06:00,068
such as llamas,

223
00:05:56,523 --> 00:06:00,068
alpacas or vicuñas.

224
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,403
You didn't ask that one,

225
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,573
but, uh, it seemed like

226
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,573
something you should know.

227
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,201
John...

228
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:10,120
is everybody at this party

229
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:10,120
gonna be a scientist like you?

230
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,997
Not everybody.

231
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,997
You'll be there.

232
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,707
That's kind of

233
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,707
what I'm gettin' at.

234
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,125
Is there a problem?

235
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,960
Well...

236
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,879
yeah.

237
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,089
I didn't go to college.

238
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,133
I was a total screwup

239
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,133
in high school.

240
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,634
I might not fit in at all.

241
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,636
Don't be silly.

242
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,636
Everyone's gonna love you!

243
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,472
And I'm excited

244
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,472
to show you off.

245
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:34,102
The general consensus among

246
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:34,102
the faculty is you don't exist.

247
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,104
Well, I don't know

248
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,104
how I feel about<i> that.</i>

249
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,482
Oh, don't worry-- it says more

250
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,482
about me than it does about you.

251
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,193
-(chuckles)

252
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,193
-(doorbell rings)

253
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,695
I'll get it.

254
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,698
It's like dating

255
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,698
the Encyclopedia Britannica.

256
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,450
Oh, hello, Sheldon.

257
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,286
Good evening.

258
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,286
Do you have any idea

259
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,788
where I could obtain

260
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,788
radioactive material?

261
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,624
That's an interesting question.

262
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,624
What do you need it for?

263
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,793
I'm trying to build

264
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,793
a small nuclear reactor

265
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,628
to provide electricity

266
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,628
for my house.

267
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,256
And possibly

268
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,256
the whole neighborhood,

269
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,757
if they're nice to me.

270
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,884
Fun.

271
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,884
The problem is,

272
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,884
I don't know

273
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,427
where to get the necessary

274
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,427
radioactive material.

275
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:12,140
Oh. Do you happen to have

276
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:12,140
any unexploded atomic bombs?

277
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,808
Not a one.

278
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,060
Shoot.

279
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,187
What about an X-ray machine?

280
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,563
Nope.

281
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,357
That makes sense.

282
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,357
You're just a kid.

283
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,692
Oh! I know!

284
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:26,113
Smoke detectors

285
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:26,113
contain trace amounts

286
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,198
of americium-241.

287
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,449
Interesting.

288
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,700
But I'd need a lot of them,

289
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:31,952
and they're expensive.

290
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,287
True.

291
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,206
Hey, I bet if you

292
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,206
call a few companies

293
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,166
and say it's for

294
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,166
a school project,

295
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,001
you could get them for free.

296
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,878
That's a great idea. Thanks.

297
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,756
You're very welcome.

298
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,592
What a cute kid.

299
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,845
Who was that at the door?

300
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,555
Sheldon.

301
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,555
What did he want?

302
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,641
Oh, nothing.

303
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,641
He just had a science query.

304
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,601
Ooh, biscuits!

305
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,149
Where's Georgie?

306
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,525
I don't know.

307
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,525
I called him ten minutes ago.

308
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,278
He's probably

309
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,278
curled up in a ball,

310
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,779
crying about

311
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,779
Veronica.

312
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:08,905
Why do you say that?

313
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,240
It's just what I'm hearing.

314
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,532
From who?

315
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,286
I'm kinda plugged

316
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,286
into this town.

317
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,455
I'll go check on him.

318
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,084
Where exactly you getting

319
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,084
all this info?

320
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,003
There's a lot of kid

321
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,003
sisters out there.

322
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,463
We talk.

323
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,173
Honey?

324
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,424
Can I come in?

325
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,550
GEORGE JR.:

326
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,550
No.

327
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,554
Aw, baby,

328
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,432
everything all right?

329
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:37,351
I don't want to talk about it.

330
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:40,895
You might feel

331
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:40,895
better if you do.

332
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,730
Is it about a girl?

333
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,816
How do you know?

334
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,487
Sometimes a mother

335
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,487
can sense these things.

336
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,323
Veronica has a boyfriend.

337
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,532
You mean Dustin?

338
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,950
You know him?

339
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,161
Well, yeah, she met him

340
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,161
through the church.

341
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,704
Lovely young man.

342
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,080
You like him?

343
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,958
Oh. Well, um...

344
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,213
the Lord teaches us

345
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,213
to like everybody.

346
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,798
I just can't stop thinking

347
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,798
about her with another guy,

348
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,591
and it's making me crazy.

349
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,927
Aw. Why don't you come eat

350
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,927
something?

351
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,221
You'll feel better.

352
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,596
I can't.

353
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,807
I feel like I got punched

354
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,807
in the stomach.

355
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:19,934
Trust me,

356
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,229
this'll pass.

357
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,981
You will meet other girls.

358
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,526
They won't be Veronica.

359
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,029
Is he taller than me?

360
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,947
It doesn't matter.

361
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,616
It's what's inside a person

362
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,616
that counts.

363
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,618
How much taller?

364
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,204
A lot.

365
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,417
Mrs. Sparks' credit card

366
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,417
got declined at Payless.

367
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,667
No kidding.

368
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,877
She went nuts.

369
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,254
But you didn't hear it from me.

370
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,505
Mm.

371
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,798
Poor baby is just crushed.

372
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,966
Oh, man.

373
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,843
I've been through that.

374
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,843
Brutal.

375
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,054
When did I break your heart?

376
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,931
Oh, it wasn't you.

377
00:09:58,806 --> 00:09:59,933
Then who was it?

378
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,309
Oh, doesn't matter.

379
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,852
It was a long time ago.

380
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,564
But who?

381
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,148
Dad, I don't want

382
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,148
to get ahead of myself,

383
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,609
but I think I solved

384
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,609
our electricity problem.

385
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,860
Not now, Sheldon.

386
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,362
I wouldn't mind hearing it.

387
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,738
Who?

388
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,991
If you want,

389
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,991
I'll ask around.

ADULT SHELDON:

392
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,455

<i>is the day they learned</i>

394
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,248
<i>to ride a bike.</i>

395
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,626
<i>For others, it's when they got</i>

396
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,626
<i>their first puppy.</i>

397
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,711
<i>For me, it was the day</i>

398
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,589
<i>I received a box</i>

399
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,589

<i>My beloved Veronica...</i>

407
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,397
Better. It's got "love" in it.

408
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,525
<i>Every minute I'm away from you</i>

409
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,525

411
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,946
<i>I can't eat, I can't sleep,</i>

412
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,240

415
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,244
So true.

416
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,288

419

<i>Because my love</i>

420
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,502
<i>is the kind of love</i>

421
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,711
<i>that is true love.</i>

422
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,214

425
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,262

<i>And when the time is right,</i>

432
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,482
<i>I'm able to shower you</i>

433
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,482

434
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,732

00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,154

<i>Georgie Cooper.</i>

440
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,285
Just tell me her name.

441
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,538
It's not important.

442
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,538
It was a long time ago.

443
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,665
Then how come I don't know

444
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,665
about it?

445
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,667
Because I married you,

446
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,667
and no one else matters.

447
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,126
If that's so,

448
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,212
why'd this mystery woman

449
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,212
break your heart?

450
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,463
(sighs, chuckles):

451
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,463
Come on, Mare.

452
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:54,922
We were young.

453
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,383
We were kids.

454
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,176
Leave it alone.

455
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,515
Just tell me her name,

456
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,515
and I'll drop it forever.

457
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,143
You swear?

458
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,395
You know I don't swear.

459
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,688
You promise?

460
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,356
Absolutely.

Kathryn Dempsey?!

463
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,153
You watched me make cupcakes

464
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,153
for her daughter's birthday,

465
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,573
and you never told me

466
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,573
you were in love with her?!

467
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,074
I was 15 years old,

468
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,825
and she didn't love me back.

469
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,202
If she did,

470
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,828
would you have married

471
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,828
her instead of me?

472
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,080
But she didn't!

473
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,331
Okay!

474
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,208
Now I have my answer.

00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,542
The graviton

582
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,542
is a massless string.

583
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,335
The graviton is

584
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,335
a massless string.

585
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:20,587
Wow!

586
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,880
Well, yes, it is.

587
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,214
(chuckles)

588
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,214
When did

589
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,424
you learn that?

590
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,634
I get around.

591
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,636
In fact,

592
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,636
I would go so far as to say

593
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,597
that every force is an exchange

594
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,597
of particles,

595
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,307
and gravity is

596
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,307
an exchange of gravitons.

597
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,475
Correct!

598
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,018
Yes!

599
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,018
(laughs)

600
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,520
John, where have you

601
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,520
been hiding<i> her?</i>

602
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:38,813
I haven't.

603
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,607
I've talked about her

604
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,607
quite a bit,

605
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,817
but you all said she was

606
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,817
a figment of my imagination.

607
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:43,984
(chuckles)

608
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,319
(chuckles)

609
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,319
She's dynamite.

610
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,321
(Linkletter and Sturgis laugh)

611
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,741
Hello. I'd like to speak

612
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,741
to Arthur Jeffries.

613
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,659
He plays Professor Proton.

614
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,369
But you probably know that,

615
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,246
since you answer the phone

616
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,246
at the station

617
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,792
that makes the show,

618
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,792
you lucky duck.

619
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,419
Then I'd like to leave him

620
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,419
another message.

621
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,421
Please tell him Sheldon Cooper

622
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,421
called again

623
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,047
and that

624
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,047
I've successfully obtained

625
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,259
the radioactive material

626
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,259
that I'm looking for.

627
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,386
Yes, americium-241.

628
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,139
I have lots of it.

629
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,683
I live at 5501 Grant Avenue,

630
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,143
Medford, Texas.

631
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,103
If you're sending me

632
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,103
an autographed picture,

633
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,438
I already have one.

634
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,274
Ooh, how about one

635
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,274
of his bow ties?

636
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,901
And then Bryan Larkin

637
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,901
read the letter

638
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,654
out loud in the hall.

639
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,654
No.

640
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,864
Georgie used the word "love,"

641
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,864
like, 30 times.

642
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,491
It was pathetic.

643
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,659
That hurts to hear.

644
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,619
Really? I think it's hilarious.

645
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,331
Also, my math teacher's

646
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,331
pregnant.

647
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,749
Well, that's nice.

648
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,919
(quietly):

649
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,919
It might not be her husband's.

650
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,130
Whose do you think it is?

651
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:52,929
Hey.

652
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,305
Hey.

653
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,516
Going somewhere?

654
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,516
Alaska.

655
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,518
Gonna work on the pipeline.

656
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,769
Alaska, huh?

657
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,312
That-That's pretty far.

658
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,439
Not far enough,

659
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,439
but it'll have to do.

660
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,650
Look, Georgie,

661
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,569
I know it feels bad

662
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,569
right now, but...

663
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,488
I promise it'll get better.

664
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,948
How's it gonna get better?

665
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,657
Veronica thinks I'm a jerk,

666
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,117
and everyone in the school's

667
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,117
calling me Lovey Cooper.

668
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,078
Ooh, that is not a good name.

669
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,580
It doesn't matter, 'cause I'm

670
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,580
never going back to that school.

671
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,959
Listen to me.

672
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,959
Hey.

673
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,713
You're a good-looking kid,

674
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:29,549
and you got a big heart.

675
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,010
Once we get you

676
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,010
on a daily shower schedule,

677
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,887
the girls

678
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,887
are gonna be lining up.

679
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,221
I don't want girls.

680
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,723
I want Veronica.

681
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,558
Yeah, maybe you'll get her

682
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,558
and maybe you won't.

683
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,643
But someday,

684
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,643
you'll find the woman

685
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,020
who was really meant for you.

686
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,730
You mean like

687
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,730
Kathryn Dempsey?

688
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,314
Alaska's beautiful.

689
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:46,858
How 'bout I go with you?

690
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,109
Who's Kathryn Dempsey?

691
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,403
I was 15 years--

692
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,031
I was 15 years old!

693
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,615
(Meemaw and Sturgis laugh)

694
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,283
Connie, tell me,

695
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,785
did you grow up in Texas?

696
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,538
Took my first bath

697
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,538
in a ten-gallon hat. (laughs)

698
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,248
(laughs)

699
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,248
That's wonderful.

700
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,001
My goodness, you're as funny

701
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,001
as you are beautiful.

702
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,169
(stammers) That's

703
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,169
a nice thing to say

704
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,546
to your friend's

705
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,546
girlfriend.

706
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,839
STURGIS: Actually,

707
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,839
I don't think

708
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,131
it<i> is</i> so nice.

709
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,009
If I didn't know any better,

710
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,803
I'd say you were sweet-talking

711
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,803
my date right in front of me.

712
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,096
You're a pretty smart man, John.

713
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,431
Trust your gut.

714
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,474
Oh, look!

715
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,351
Shrimp cocktail.

716
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,351
Let's get some.

717
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,186
Now, hang on.

718
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,186
Hey. Take your hand off her,

719
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,314
or there are gonna be

720
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,314
some severe consequences.

721
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,942
Whoa, John, calm down.

722
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,109
What do you see in this guy?

723
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,402
All right, that's it!

724
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,820
(grunts)

725
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,820
(gasps)

726
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,405
Oh, boy,

727
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,405
you shouldn't have done that.

728
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,656
(shouts)

729
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,656
Oh!

730
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,656
(gasping)

731
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,075
That's enough!

732
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,075
Both of you,

733
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,409
just cool your jets.

734
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,079
This isn't over,

735
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,079
Dr. Linkletter!

736
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,248
Anytime, anyplace,

737
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,248
Dr. Sturgis.

738
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,793
And your graviton

739
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,793
research

740
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,336
is mediocre at best!

741
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,547
(guests gasping)

742
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,547
Keep moving.

743
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:52,840
Are you angry with me?

744
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,050
More turned on.

745
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,843
Ooh. Great. Let's go.

746
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,975
Good morning, Mary.

747
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,517
Hmm.

748
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,062
(sighs, grunts)

749
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,855
What's that about?

750
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,482
I'm punishing him.

751
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,775
What for?

752
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,318
Nothing, really.

753
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,779
But once I got started,

754
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,779
I couldn't stop.

755
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,779
(laughs)

756
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,197
(doorbell rings)

757
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,197
GEORGE SR.:

758
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,197
I'll get it!

759
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,407
(filtered breathing)

760
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:19,784
The hell?

761
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,452
Sheldon Cooper live here?

762
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,081
(Geiger counters clicking)

763
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,499
Mare!

764
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,254
(garage door clacking)

765
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,801
(indistinct radio chatter)

766
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,303
Am I in trouble?

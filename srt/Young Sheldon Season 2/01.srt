ADULT SHELDON:<i> Some people</i>

2
00:00:01,627 --> 00:00:03,253
<i>have said I'm overly sensitive.</i>

00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,631
(screaming)

4
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:09,593
What now?

5
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:12,053
Missy gave me cinnamon gum!

6
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:16,015
Sure, sure.

7
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:18,560

<i>And by some people,</i>

00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:18,560

16
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,236
Ew.

17
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,699
Georgie, put your

18
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,699
shoes back on!

19
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,617
He can't smell this.

20
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,619
Yes, I can!

ADULT SHELDON:<i> I also had</i>

22
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:38,205

00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:43,335
<i>During dinner, I could tune out</i>

24
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:43,335
<i>the cacophony of chewing,</i>

25
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,004
<i>slurping,</i>

26
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:49,758
<i>chewing, cutlery scraping</i>

<i>against plates,</i>

28

<i>chewing,</i>

29

<i>and my father's heavy breathing</i>

31

<i>with a ketchup bottle.</i>

32
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,181
(George Sr. breathing heavily)

33
00:00:56,223 --> 00:01:00,352
<i>But tonight, there was</i>

34
00:00:56,223 --> 00:01:00,352
<i>one sound I couldn't tune out.</i>

35
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,771
(high-pitched buzzing)

36
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,438
(slurping)

37
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,233
Why aren't you

38
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,233
eating, Sheldon?

39
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:09,695
(buzzing continues)

40
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:09,695
How can I

41
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:09,695
with that horrible noise?

42
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:10,988
What noise?

43
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,741
That irritating,

44
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,741
high-pitched buzz.

45
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,325
I don't hear nothin'.

46
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,535
Me, neither.

47
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,037
(buzzing continues)

48
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,037
How can you not?

49
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,329
MISSY:

50
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,329
Wait.

51
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:20,247
I think I hear it.

52
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,165
You do?

53
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,165
Yeah.

54
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,083
It's coming out of your face.

55
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,962
(buzzing continues)

56
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:30,131
I guess I hear a little hum.

57
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,551
Refrigerators make

58
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,551
noise, Sheldon.

59
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,136
This is new. It's never

60
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,136
made this sound before.

61
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,638
We should call a repairman.

62
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,891
I'm not spending money

63
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,891
on a fridge that's workin'.

64
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,769
Then think of it as spending

65
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,769
money on my mental stability.

66
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,145
Ignore it, Sheldon.

67
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,942

(Sheldon humming)

82
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,473
What are you doing?

83
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,349
The sound from the refrigerator.

84
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,852
It's right between D

85
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,852
and D-sharp.

86
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,980
Ugh! It's making my skin crawl.

87
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,649
What if I hold a pillow

88
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,649
over your face

00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,233

00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,027
No, that's dangerous.

91
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,362
Do you know if we have earplugs?

92
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,323
If we did, I'd

93
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,323
be wearing them.

94
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,908
Go to sleep.

95
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,535
(sighs)

96
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,535
I can't.

97
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,746
Put your fingers in your ears.

98
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,499
And risk driving wax back

99
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,499
into my inner ear canal?

100
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,667
No, thank you.

101
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,043

Oh.

104
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,301
(continues humming note)

105
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,893
Good morning.

106
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,893
(yells)

107
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,562
(chuckles):

108
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,562
Are you trying to kill me?

109
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,189
No, I think

110
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,189
you're great.

111
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,109
Then why are you

112
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,109
in my bed?

113
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:13,485
I couldn't sleep.

114
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,030
Our refrigerator is

115
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,030
making a weird noise.

116
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,990
But so was one

117
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,990
of your nostrils,

118
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,616
so don't expect

119
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,616
me back tonight.

120
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,368
Go home before

121
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,368
I call the police.

122
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,537
You wouldn't call the

123
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,537
police on your Moonpie.

124
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,955
Then I'll call your mother.

125
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:27,833
That you would do.

126
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,544
And leave my extra key behind.

127
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,754
Aw.

128
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,007
Aw.

129
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,885
(indistinct chatter)

130
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,058
Do you know anything about

131
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,058
surviving psychological torture?

132
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,393
Because my family

133
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,393
escaped communist Vietnam,

134
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,728
we have to know about torture?

135
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,396
That was my thought.

136
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,023
Well, you're in luck.

137
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,733
What do you want to know?

138
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,276
I'm being tormented by a sound

139
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,276
coming from our refrigerator,

140
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,445
and I don't know how

141
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,445
to deal with it.

142
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,865
When my uncle was

143
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,865
in a reeducation camp,

144
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,534
he would imagine

145
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,534
disemboweling his torturers

146
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,494
with a bamboo spike.

147
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,582
Maybe I'll just get a book

148
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,582
on refrigerator repair instead.

149
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,750
Okay.

150
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,418
New subject.

151
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,962
Jessica Gieger

152
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,962
wears a black bra.

153
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,339
I saw it through the

154
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,339
sleeve of her shirt.

155
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,259
Not beige, not pink.

156
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,386
Black.

157
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,722
So mysterious.

158
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,688
What are you doing?

159
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,688
I'm going

160
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,148
to take apart

161
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,148
the refrigerator

162
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,150
and figure out what's

163
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,150
making that noise.

164
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:38,153
That is a really good idea.

165
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,115
Usually you're not

166
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,115
supportive of my efforts.

167
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,574
I'm more mature now.

168
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,285
(Missy giggles)

169
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,752
Hi, Mom.

170
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,295
What did you do?!

171
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,381
Good news. I found out

172
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,381
what part was making that noise.

173
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,050
You have to put

174
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,050
this back together!

175
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,927
Now we're getting

176
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,927
to the bad news.

177
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,221
What made you think

178
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,221
you could fix this?

179
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,306
I'm smart...

180
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,306
and I had a book.

181
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:09,101
Do you<i> still</i> think

182
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:09,101
you're smart?

183
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,228
Yes.

184
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,440
I told him not to do it.

185
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,440
He wouldn't listen.

186
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,031
$200?!

187
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,284
It'll be okay.

188
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,284
We'll find the money.

189
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,827
(scoffs)

190
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,827
Wait.

191
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,454
The old fridge

192
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,454
in the garage!

193
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,454
(inhales sharply)

194
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,664
What's it...? What was...?

195
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,664
What's that?

that fridge to the church.

Are you our new paperboy?

390
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,872
Yes, I'm joining

528
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,172

think that was a Sizzler.

563
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,758

564
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,384
No, the Chi-Chi's is on Bedford,

00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,010
across from

566
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,010
the Payless Shoes.

567
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,513
She's right. Because,

568
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,513
one time, we got shoes

569
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,056
and then we got Chi-Chi's.

570
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,516
That was a good day.

571
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,560
GEORGE SR.: Huh. I guess

572
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,560
that was a Sizzler.

573
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,353

574
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,314

00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,448
Is it too much to ask

581
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,448
for a dinner

582
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,908
with a little peace and quiet?

583
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,660
Sheldon, you

584
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,660
do not talk

585
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,035
to your father like that.

586
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,456
Fine. I'd rather not speak

587
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,456
to any of you.

588
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,958
(grunts)

589
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,960
Maybe I better go talk to him.

590
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,419
No, I got this.

591
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,419
George,

592
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,796
maybe you should

593
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,796
calm down first.

594
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,673
I got this.

595
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,973
You want to

596
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,973
explain yourself?

597
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,432
I'd rather just go to bed,

598
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,768
since I have to be up

599
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,768
in a few hours anyway.

600
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,604
Look, I understand you're tired,

601
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,604
but that is no reason for you...

602
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,898
I'm not just tired.

603
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,898
I'm exhausted.

604
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,107
Everything hurts.

605
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:06,233
I get up in the morning

606
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,486
to do this job

607
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,486
I don't even like.

608
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,237
And I'm doing it

609
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,237
just for the money,

610
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,031
and it's not even

611
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,031
a lot of money.

612
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:14,617
I keep trying harder

613
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:14,617
and harder,

614
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,536
and it doesn't

615
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,536
even make a difference.

616
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,329
So if you're going

617
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,329
to yell at me or punish me,

618
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,957
let's just get it over with.

619
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,375
(sighs)

620
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,047
I'm not gonna punish you.

621
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,591
Why not? I deserve it.

622
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,471
Let me tell you about<i> my</i> day.

623
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,390
I got yelled at

624
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,390
by the principal

625
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,600
for benching a linebacker

626
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,600
who's flunking English.

627
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,436
Then I got yelled at even

628
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,436
more by the kid's parents.

629
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,481
Then I had to break up

630
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,481
a fight in the locker room.

631
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,191
Got elbowed in the neck.

632
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,317
That's a rough day.

633
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,486
That was all

634
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,486
before 10:00 a.m.

635
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,198
So I get what you're

636
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,198
going through.

637
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,827
But you'll notice, I didn't come

638
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,827
home and take it out on you.

639
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,372
No, you didn't.

640
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,123
I want you to get

641
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,123
back in there,

642
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,044
apologize to everyone,

643
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,044
and finish your dinner.

644
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,087
Yes, sir.

645
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,676
ADULT SHELDON:<i> My father's</i>

646
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,676
<i>wisdom touched me deeply.</i>

647
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,261
<i>Which is why, to this day,</i>

648
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,804
<i>no matter</i>

649
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,804
<i>what I'm going through,</i>

650
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,015
<i>I am never irritating</i>

651
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,015
<i>or abusive</i>

652
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:22,184
<i>to any of my friends</i>

653
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:22,184
<i>or loved ones.</i>

654
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,519
<i>Ask them. They'll tell you.</i>

655
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,359
ADULT SHELDON:

656
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,359
<i>For the next several months,</i>

657
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,486
<i>I continued working</i>

658
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,486
<i>my paper route</i>

659
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,615
<i>until I paid my father back.</i>

660
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,200
(thunder rumbling)

661
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,370
<i>And by "working,"</i>

662
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,370
<i>I mean "delegating."</i>

663
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,210
I have no idea where I am.

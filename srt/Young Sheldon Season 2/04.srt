our expenditures

35
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,030

Any idea why?

00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:16,368
There's a person at the end of

the table that eats for free.

41
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,662

00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,205

(laughs)

45
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:23,667
I've been buying groceries

46
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:23,667
for the church food drive.

47
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,084
I think that's it.

48
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,128
Ooh, I bet I could

49
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,128
write that off,

00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,924
including the gas it took to

51
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,924
drive to the grocery store

52
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,299
and then to the church.

53
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,634
With all that driving,

54
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,634
maybe she can count

55
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,261
her car as a home office.

56
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:37,056
Sounds aggressive, but I like

57
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:37,056
how you're thinking.

58
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:40,099
None of that is necessary,

59
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:40,099
it's for charity.

60
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,811
What's the point of charity

61
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,811
if there are no tax benefits?

62
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,354
Eat your peas.

63
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:45,731
I like how he's thinking.

64
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,441
You eat your peas, too.

65
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,901
(laughs)

66
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,238
Dad, banking question.

67
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,489
What's that, buddy?

68
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,075
I noticed there's

69
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,075
a check missing.

70
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,118
I have a copy of check 128

71
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,746
and a copy of check 130,

72
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,746
but 129 isn't there.

73
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,707
Oh, yeah,

74
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,707
don't worry about it.

75
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:06,501
But I enjoy worrying;

76
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:06,501
I find it very relaxing.

77
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,962
'Course you do.

78
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,336
I balanced the rest

79
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,336
of the account,

80
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:11,673
and it appears to be

81
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:11,673
a check for $300.

82
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,718
All right, well,

83
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,718
let's just put it down

84
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,595
for $300 for miscellaneous.

85
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,890
I've never labeled anything

86
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,890
miscellaneous in my life.

87
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:21,141
I'll go ask Mom.

88
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,935
Wait. (chuckles)

89
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:26,438
I just remembered.

90
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,066
I gave the money to a friend.

91
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:31,026
Who?

92
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:31,026
It doesn't matter who.

93
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,402
Why'd you give it to them?

94
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:35,030
They needed it.

95
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:35,030
It... it's like charity.

96
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,658
Ooh, another write-off,

97
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,658
excellent.

98
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,868
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

99
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:44,748
What do you say

100
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:44,748
we keep this quiet?

101
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,583
You mean like a secret?

102
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,544
No, no, just, you know,

103
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,544
something between you and me.

104
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,838
What about Mom?

105
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,547
Mom is on a need-to-know basis.

106
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,799
What if Mom needs to know?

107
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,592
Okay, it's a secret.

108
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,260
Just trust me.

109
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,680
It is better for everyone

110
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,680
if she doesn't know about this.

111
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,598
But I'm not good

112
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,598
at keeping secrets.

113
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,642
It's not hard.

114
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,642
Just keep your mouth shut.

115
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,477
But I'm not good at

116
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,477
keeping my mouth shut.

117
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,731
Sheldon, all you got to do

118
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,731
is be cool.

<i>to fly around the backyard.</i>

123

Love you, too.

127

Oh, hello.

128
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:30,002
I was just brushing my teeth

129
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:30,002
like I do every night.

130
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:32,087
(laughs nervously)

131
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:32,087
Nothing new there.

132
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,254
You all right?

133
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,256
Yes. I'm cool.

134
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,176
I'm very cool.

135
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,927
Tell Sheldon what cool means.

136

Hush.

137
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,097
Sweet dreams.

138
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,183
Love you.

139
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,019
Love you, too,

You're so weird.

00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,238
More than usual?

144
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,241
No, I guess not.

145
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,910

150

Mm-hmm.

So how big a tax refund

156

you think we're gonna get?

157
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,722
Mm.

00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,851
I slept in the nude last night.

anything off with Sheldon?

Uh, no, no, no.

188
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,522
Can't say that I have. Why?

189
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,651
He's been awful quiet, and,

190
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,651
at the risk of being indelicate,

191

without a bowel movement.

193
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,614
How do you know that?

194
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,574
Well, I was worried about him,

195
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,951
so I took a look

196
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,951
in his potty journal.

197
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,702
He's still keeping

198
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,702
that thing, huh?

199
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,413
Oh, yeah, that's why he wanted

200
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,413
the Polaroid camera.

201
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,541
Uh, well,

202
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,541
I'm sure he's gonna be fine,

203
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,961
uh, but I'll keep an eye on him.

204
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,797
Thank you.

205
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,797
You got it.

206
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,594
(whispering): She's gone.

207
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,594
SHELDON: Thank you.

208
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,388
Batteries are in this drawer.

209
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,270
(knocking on door)

210
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,815
We got a problem.

211
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,820
I don't know how much longer

212
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,820
Sheldon can hold out.

213
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,198
This is why I did not want you

214
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,198
to write a check.

215
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,657
Well, I'm sorry,

216
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,657
but I didn't have

217
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,117
that kind of cash

218
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,117
lying around.

219
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,368
I do not want Mary to find out

220
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,368
about this.

221
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,871
Well, what about Sheldon?

222
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,581
The kid hasn't pooped

223
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,581
in days, he might pop.

224
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,335
Slip a little Metamucil into

225
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,335
his apple juice, he'll be fine.

226
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,170
Why don't we just come clean?

227
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,590
All right, sure,

228
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,590
we could do that.

229
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,220
You could rat me out

230
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,220
to Mary and...

231
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:29,597
I could tell her what you did

232
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:29,597
at the church picnic.

233
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,266
Come on.

234
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,767
Now you're just playing dirty.

235
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,312
We sink or swim together,

236
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,312
George.

237
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:38,523
We sink or swim together.

238
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,822
Grandmas are supposed

239
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,822
to be nice.

240
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,115
What went wrong with you?

241
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,162
ADULT SHELDON:<i> Avoiding</i>

242
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,162
<i>my mother in our own house</i>

243
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,412
<i>was proving to be difficult,</i>

244
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,665
<i>so it was time</i>

245
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,665
<i>to get creative.</i>

246
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:59,836
Hello. I'd like to book a room

247
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:59,836
in your hotel.

248
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,339
I'd be arriving tonight.

249
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:06,343
No, it's just me.

250
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:09,596
Ooh, a queen bed,

251
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:09,596
that sounds fancy.

252
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:13,308
And how much

253
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:13,308
would this room cost?

254
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,561
Wow. Is that per month?

255
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,273
Per day?

256
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,401
By any chance, do you have

257
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,401
a children's rate?

258
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,446
We've been friends for

259
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,446
a while now, haven't we?

260
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,365
I suppose so.

261
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,201
Given that, how would you

262
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,201
feel about a sleepover?

263
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,287
Sure. Your mom

264
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,287
lets you watch TV.

265
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,955
<i>Jake and the Fatman</i>

266
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,955
is on tonight.

267
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,374
I meant we could sleep

268
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,374
at your house.

269
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,209
But you'll miss

270
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,209
<i>Jake and the Fatman.</i>

271
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,795
Even better.

272
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,795
So what do you say?

273
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,464
I'll have to ask my mom.

274
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,591
Well, be sure to tell her

275
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,591
I'm clean, I'm well-behaved,

276
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,385
and if you don't have

277
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,385
a lot of room,

278
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:51,138
I can fit

279
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:51,138
in really tight spaces.

280
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,768
So your first sleepover.

281
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,312
Pretty exciting, huh?

282
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,231
No. It's not exciting,

283
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,231
it's constipating,

284
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,275
and I'm only doing it

285
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,275
to avoid Mom.

286
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:06,278
But still,

287
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:06,278
it's your first sleepover.

288
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,196
It's fun stuff.

289
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,450
Okay, I know you're having

290
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,450
a tough time with this,

291
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,785
but... you're doing great.

292
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,163
You spend some time

293
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,163
at Tam's house,

294
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,749
you know, clear your head,

295
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,749
and come back home refreshed.

296
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,126
And then I can tell Mom?

297
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,627
Oh, no, you can

298
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,627
never tell Mom.

299
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,672
Wouldn't it be easier

300
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,672
to just be honest?

301
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,633
Usually, it would be, but...

302
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,636
sometimes the truth

303
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,636
can hurt people. Hmm?

304
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,596
We wouldn't want

305
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,596
to hurt Mom, right?

306
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,847
Of course not.

307
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,350
Attaboy.

308
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,477
(music playing over radio)

309
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,231
Hey, here's a funny prank

310
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,231
you can try tonight.

311
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,775
When Tam falls asleep, put some

312
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,775
shaving cream in his hand

313
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,068
and then tickle his nose.

314
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,320
Why?

315
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,197
'Cause then he'll go to,

316
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,572
you know, scratch his nose,

317
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,658
and he gets shaving cream

318
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,658
on his face.

319
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,160
And then what?

320
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:58,705
Well... that-that's it.

321
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,332
But I'm a guest

322
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,332
in their home,

323
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,292
and that doesn't seem

324
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,292
like a very good way

325
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,626
to repay their kindness.

326
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,837
Never mind.

327
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,797
And what if the shaving cream

328
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,797
gets in his eyes?

329
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,007
That would sting.

330
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,384
Sorry I mentioned it.

331
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,718
Also, I didn't bring

332
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,718
my own shaving cream.

333
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,094
I'd have to use his dad's,

334
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,094
and that...

335
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,180
Forget it!

336
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,180
(clears throat)

337
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,808
(doorbell rings)

338
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,187
Hello.

339
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,147
Hi. You must be Mrs....

340
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,565
Tam's mom.

341
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,401
I'm Sheldon's dad,

342
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,401
George Cooper.

343
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:28,735
Nice to meet you.

344
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,237
Thanks for letting him

345
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,237
spend the night.

346
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,239
It's his first sleepover.

347
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,239
He's excited.

348
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,032
Actually, I'm quite apprehens...

349
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,825
He's really looking forward

350
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,825
to it.

351
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,160
Uh, in case something

352
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,037
comes up,

353
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,037
just give us a holler.

354
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,373
I mean, a call. If you hollered,

355
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,373
we wouldn't hear you.

356
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,749
(chuckles)

357
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,335
That-that was a joke.

358
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,170
(forced):

359
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,170
Ha-ha-ha!

360
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,297
Okay, buddy, have fun.

361
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,884
ADULT SHELDON:

362
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,884
<i>Visiting Tam's house</i>

363
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,137
<i>for the first time was</i>

364
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,137
<i>an emotional roller coaster.</i>

365
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,307
<i>For example, it's traditional</i>

366
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,307
<i>in Vietnamese homes</i>

367
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,893
<i>to have gruesome religious</i>

368
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,893
<i>iconography near the entrance.</i>

369
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,937
<i>I did not like that.</i>

370
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,440
<i>However, it's also customary</i>

371
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,982
<i>to not wear shoes</i>

372
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,982
<i>around the house</i>

373
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,984
<i>for sanitary reasons.</i>

374
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,945
<i>I did like that.</i>

375
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,572
<i>Interestingly,</i>

376
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,116
<i>one of the main ingredients</i>

377
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,116
<i>in Vietnamese cooking</i>

378
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,660
<i>is an extremely pungent</i>

379
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,660
<i>condiment known as fish sauce.</i>

380
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,538
<i>I did not like that.</i>

381
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,373
<i>But before every meal,</i>

382
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:27,043
<i>it's common for everyone</i>

383
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:27,043
<i>to wash their hands and face.</i>

384
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,711
<i>I did like that.</i>

385
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:32,215
<i>Forks are not customary</i>

386
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:32,215
<i>in a Vietnamese household.</i>

387
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,550
(giggles)

388
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,803
<i>I did not like that.</i>

389
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,722
<i>And instead of napkins,</i>

390
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,722
<i>there was one towel</i>

391
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,600
<i>for everyone</i>

392
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,600
<i>to share at the table.</i>

393
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,645
<i>Seriously,</i>

394
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,645
<i>what are they thinking?</i>

395
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,440
I can't help thinking

396
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,440
how odd it is

397
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,192
that Shelly volunteered

398
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,192
to go on a sleepover.

399
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,402
Oh, I don't know.

400
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,237
Hmm?

401
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,237
He's growing up.

402
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,656
It's natural for a young boy

403
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,656
to want to spread his wings

404
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,492
a little bit,

405
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,492
try something new.

406
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,700
That's nonsense.

407
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,202
Last week,

408
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,202
I brought home

409
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,121
the Raisin Bran

410
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,121
with the sugar on the raisins.

411
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,123
He almost lost his mind.

412
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,541
If you ask me,

413
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,335
you're worried

414
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,335
about nothing.

415
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,462
(sighs)

416
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,462
Maybe it's me.

417
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:13,381
Maybe I did something

418
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:13,381
to upset him.

419
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,882
What are you talking about?

420
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,092
He loves you

421
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,344
like crazy.

422
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,845
Much more

423
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,845
than he loves this one.

424
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,054
It's true.

425
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,515
I don't know.

426
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,350
I just feel

427
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,350
like something isn't right.

428
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,018
MISSY:

429
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,018
Mom!

430
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,561
I got my

431
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,561
hair stuck

432
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:27,937
in my zipper!

433
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,981
That's the kid you need

434
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,981
to be worried about.

435
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,777
(quietly): Okay, Connie, why

436
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,777
don't we just come clean?

437
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:35,987
No.

438
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,238
(scoffs)

439
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,238
You heard her.

440
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,073
Now she's blaming herself.

441
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,492
And Sheldon's so upset

442
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,869
he's-he's acting

443
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,869
like a regular kid.

444
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,079
All right, let's tell her.

445
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,079
Thank you.

446
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,248
But first I'm gonna tell her

447
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,248
what you did at the picnic.

448
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,292
Oh, Mary!

449
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,292
Okay, okay, shh.

450
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,254
(sighs)

451
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,882
I don't know how much longer

452
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,882
we can keep this going.

453
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,552
I'm willing to find out.

454
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:08,019
So, this game is called

455
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:08,019
<i>Mystic Warlords of Ka'a.</i>

456
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,437
It's pretty fun.

457
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,398
There are six kinds

458
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,398
of secret warlords...

459
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,693
<i>Secret warlords.</i>

460
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,693
GEORGE SR.:

461
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,693
<i>It's a secret. Secret.</i>

462
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,194
It's a secret.

463
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,862
Have you noticed anything off

464
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,862
with Sheldon?

465
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,113
Something between me

466
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,113
and you.

467
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,907
Mom is on a

468
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,907
need-to-know basis.

469
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,617
I took a little look

470
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,617
in his potty journal.

471
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,952
It's a secret.

472
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,952
Several days without

473
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,952
a bowel movement.

474
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,538
TAM: Sheldon.

475
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,538
Secret.

476
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,538
Secret.

477
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,039
A secret.

478
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,039
TAM:<i> Sheldon.</i>

479
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,333
Did you hear

480
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,333
anything I said?

481
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:34,421
Sorry, I was reliving

482
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:34,421
a traumatic experience.

483
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,796
What do you mean?

484
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,094
Tam, I have a secret

485
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,094
that's weighing on me,

486
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,761
and I need to tell someone.

487
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,055
Okay. Tell me.

488
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,015
But I promised I wouldn't.

489
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,975
Okay. Then don't.

490
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,852
But it's driving me crazy.

491
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,104
Too bad you're not Catholic.

492
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,813
You could confess

493
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,813
it to a priest.

494
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,024
That's a great idea.

495
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,485
You're Catholic.

496
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,485
I'll confess it to you.

497
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,903
I'm not a priest.

498
00:12:58,945 --> 00:12:59,946
I'm not a Catholic.

499
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,489
It makes perfect sense.

500
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,659
Okay, whenever

501
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,659
you're ready.

502
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,036
What are you doing?

503
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,330
I'm assuming the position.

504
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,873
Okay.

505
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,585
Forgive me, Tam,

506
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,585
for I have sinned.

507
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,629
This is my first confession.

508
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,838
I forgive you, my son.

509
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,385
I was doing my parents' taxes

510
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,385
and noticed a check was missing.

511
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,053
I asked my father about it...

512
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,053
ADULT SHELDON:

513
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,053
<i>As I walked Tam</i>

514
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,804
<i>through the whole</i>

515
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,804
<i>sordid affair,</i>

516
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,600
<i>I could feel a weight</i>

517
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,600
<i>lifting off my shoulders.</i>

518
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:31,352
<i>It was a relief</i>

519
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:31,352
<i>to finally unburden myself</i>

520
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,979
<i>of this deception.</i>

521
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,606
<i>By the time I reached the end,</i>

522
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,899
<i>I felt like a new person.</i>

523
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,943
That's the whole story.

524
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,237
Cool. Can we play now?

525
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,281
<i>And now that my conscience</i>

526
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,281
<i>had been cleared,</i>

527
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,075
<i>my colon was ready</i>

528
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,075
<i>to do the same.</i>

529
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:49,036
Excuse me. I need

530
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:49,036
to use your bathroom!

531
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,539
(door creaks closed)

532
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,836
Thank you for letting me sleep

533
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,836
in your bed.

534
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:01,508
My father taught me that

535
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:01,508
we must always honor our guests

536
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,134
and treat them

537
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,134
with the utmost courtesy.

538
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,012
The Vietnamese

539
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,012
are a very welcoming people.

540
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:09,307
Yeah, that hasn't

541
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:09,307
always worked out for us.

542
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,603
(grunts)

543
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,272
Do you think

544
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,272
your dad would ever ask you

545
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,232
to keep a secret from your mom?

546
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,400
Oh, no.

547
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,820
He's so honest, it's annoying.

548
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,697
Enough talking.

549
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,824
Sleep now.

550
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,243
She's just annoying.

551
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,412
♪ ♪

552
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,503
Well, you did it.

553
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,380
(grunts)

554
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,674
How was your first sleepover?

555
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,094
They feed you any weird food?

556
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,681
When I was in 'Nam,

557
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,681
we ate fish soup for breakfast.

558
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:50,849
(chuckles)

559
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,100
Sheldon, I'm

560
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,100
talking to you.

561
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,562
Well, I'm not talking

562
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,562
to you.

563
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,355
Okay, what's going on?

564
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,858
After having my first

565
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,858
good night's sleep in a week,

566
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,109
I woke up

567
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,109
with a fresh perspective.

568
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,361
And that is...?

569
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,446
It was irresponsible of you

570
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,114
to burden me with that secret.

571
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,701
Sheldon, we've been

572
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,701
through this. (stammers)

573
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,494
It's complicated.

574
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,748
While I may not look up to you

575
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,748
from an intellectual standpoint,

576
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,166
I've always looked up

577
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,166
to you as a role model.

578
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,548
I can't do that anymore.

579
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,052
And don't worry--

580
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,052
we made a deal.

581
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,431
I'll continue

582
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,431
to keep your secret.

583
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,475
♪ ♪

584
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,312
(engine starts)

585
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,565
(birds singing)

586
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,317
Hey.

587
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,569
What's up?

588
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,780
Um, I need to tell

589
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,780
you something.

590
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,030
What did you do?

591
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,533
(sighs) When Sheldon

592
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,533
was doing our taxes,

593
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,827
he noticed a missing check.

594
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,036
What did you do?

595
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,538
Before I answer,

596
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,538
do you trust me enough

597
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,540
to understand

598
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,540
it was for a good reason

599
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,208
and j-just leave it at that?

600
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,755
(gulps)

601
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,423
What did you do?

602
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,425
It's all your mother's fault.

603
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,425
She is a bad person.

604
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,343
I've been telling you for years.

605
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,053
What did you do?

606
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,139
Okay, now,

607
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,139
before I answer that--

608
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,515
Just tell me

609
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,515
what you did.

610
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:15,892
I got a DWI.

611
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,644
Mom!

612
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,312
It's not as bad as it sounds.

613
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,689
How is driving drunk not bad?

614
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,190
I wasn't exactly driving.

615
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,443
I don't follow.

616
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,779
I was at the dog track

617
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,779
with Georgie,

618
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,196
and I had a few...

619
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,782
<i>Georgie?</i>

620
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,199
With God as my witness,

621
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,535
I've never been to the dog track

622
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,535
in my life.

623
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,496
(quietly):

624
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,496
She knows.

625
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,080
Oh, I've been

626
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,080
there a bunch.

627
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,458
Will someone please tell me

628
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,458
what happened?

629
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,003
Okay, me and Meemaw were

630
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,003
in the bar at the track...

631
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,797
You took him to a bar?

632
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,047
He wasn't drinking.

633
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,175
She had a few

634
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,175
too many margaritas,

635
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,468
so I drove us home.

636
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,261
But you don't have a license.

637
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:55,139
That's why we swapped places

638
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:55,139
after the cop pulled us over.

639
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,516
Oh, dear Lord.

640
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,767
I had nothing to do

641
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,767
with this part.

642
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,644
Shut up.

643
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,644
Will do.

644
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,103
MEEMAW: I didn't

645
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,103
want Georgie

646
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,355
to get into trouble,

647
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,064
so I got behind the wheel

648
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,900
before the cop

649
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,900
walked up.

650
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,234
And then I got arrested,

651
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,234
and, uh,

652
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,945
he bailed me out.

653
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,239
So you all thought

654
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,239
you should keep this from me?

655
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,782
Absolutely.

656
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,782
100%.

657
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,782
Yes.

658
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,035
Okay, here's what's

659
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,035
gonna happen: you

660
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,704
and you are staying

661
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,704
at her house

662
00:17:17,744 --> 00:17:19,664
until I say otherwise.

663
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,790
One could argue I was

664
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,790
the hero in this story.

665
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,836
You went gambling and you drove

666
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,836
without a license

667
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,420
and you lied to my face.

668
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,797
Heroically.

669
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,590
Go.

670
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,973
I love everything

671
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,973
about this.

672
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,644
I'm guessing you're mad at me.

673
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,103
Aw, forget about it.

674
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,939
I appreciate you not...

675
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,441
ratting me out about the picnic.

676
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,319
Well, we had a deal.

677
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,948
Besides, your marriage

678
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,948
is already hanging by a thread.

679
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,449
It is dangling there.

680
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,870
All right, well,

681
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,870
I'm gonna turn in.

682
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,413
Mmm.

683
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,873
Good night.

684
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,251
Night!

685
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,590
(phone rings)

686
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,841
Hello?

687
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,342
MEEMAW:

688
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,342
So, get a load of this.

689
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,762
Last church picnic,

690
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,762
your husband

691
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,597
snuck in a six-pack,

692
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,098
polished off the whole thing,

693
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,225
then went to wait in line

694
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,225
for the bathroom...

695
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,769
Hey.

696
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,437
You got an extra toothbrush?

697
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,188
Under the sink, darlin'.

698
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,440
Thanks.

699
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,525
You got it.

700
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:33,780
So then the big gorilla decides

701
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:33,780
he doesn't want to wait in line,

702
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,824
so he stumbles over

703
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,824
to the church vegetable garden

704
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:41,328
and proceeds to irrigate

705
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:41,328
the whole damn thing.

706
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,790
I've eaten those vegetables.

707
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,667
Sweet dreams.

708
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,667
(laughs)

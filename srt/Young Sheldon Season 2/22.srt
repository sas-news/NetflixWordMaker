2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,295
radio crackling)

3
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:04,713
What on Earth...?

4
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,430
Hello?

5
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,808
Hello, Mom.

6
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,808
Hi.

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,976
I bet you're wondering.

8
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,143
I sure am.

9
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,436
It's a shortwave radio.

10
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:20,688
Dr. Sturgis

11
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:20,688
is letting me use it.

15
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,024
Listen.

16
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:28,696
This is the time being announced

17
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:28,696
every minute from Ottawa.

18
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,072
OPERATOR: At the sound of the

19
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,072
tone, the local time in Ottawa

20
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,533
will be 5:13.

21
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,533
(beeps)

22
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,243
Spellbinding, ain't it?

23
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,913
And you thought this was okay

24
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,913
to go on in my house?

25
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,415
It was that or my house,

26
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,415
so here we are.

27
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,543
Wednesday morning, the

28
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,543
Nobel Prize winners are going

29
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,671
to be announced in Sweden, and

30
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,671
we'll hear it as it's happening.

31
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,465
Well, 2.8 milliseconds later.

32
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:49,884
Sure, because

33
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:49,884
of the propagation.

34
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,093
And what's this?

35
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,093
Some kind of antenna?

36
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,805
Yes. It needs to go

37
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,805
up on the roof.

38
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,598
You're not going on the roof.

39
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,059
Of course he's not. I am.

40
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,268
You're not going, either.

41
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,480
Excuse me, I have six years

42
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,690
of tai chi under my belt.

43
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:07,067
I have the balance

44
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:07,067
of a jungle cat.

45
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,487
You doing some kind of

48
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:13,073

49
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:17,202

58
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,313
Yes.

59
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,482
So you can hear who won

60
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,482
a science prize?

61
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,068
The Nobel Prize.

62
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,236
(sighs) Why can't you read

63
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,236
who won in the newspaper?

64
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,238
I could say the same thing

65
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,238
about the Super Bowl,

66
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,448
but you still watch it.

67
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,741
He got you there.

68
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,618
The Super Bowl is football.

69
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,080
Your thing is... I don't

70
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,080
even know what your thing is.

71
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,165
It's the most prestigious award

72
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,165
in the field of physics.

73
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,668
I'll think about it.

74
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,464
When I win one, I might

75
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,464
just thank you in my speech.

76
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,549

Georgie, get out here!

79
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,850
Got a chore for you!

80
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,979
Good call.

81
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,979
You have no business up there.

82
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,107

00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:37,282
Excellent. Which scientists

90
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,162
There's so much good

91
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,162
work being done.

92
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,998
I think it's time

Frederick Reines

finally gets his due

95

for the neutrino.

96
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,293
I suppose he has a shot.

97
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,587
I should think so, he confirmed

98
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,587
the neutrino's existence

99
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,006
35 years ago.

are they waiting for?

102
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:58,762
Lots of talented people

You know if we had cable,

108
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,980
we'd have, like, 60 channels?

109
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:10,231
We have plenty of channels.

110
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,525
We have seven.

111
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,902
Hey! There are starving kids

112
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,902

113
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,154

114

Come on, it don't cost much.

115
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,699
I'm not paying for television.

116
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,619
Television is free.

117
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,619
Always was, always will be.

118
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,912
You're so cheap.

If you want cable,

pay for it yourself.

121
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,961
Or better yet, try turning that

What are you doing out here?

Weeding. You have goosegrass.

00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:55,318
And you can't have a nice lawn

134

the mainframe computer lab,

196
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,537
tripped off an alarm.

197
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,082
Security came,

198
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,082
and there was a chase.

199
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,374
A chase?

200
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,961
It was a short one.

201
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,961
He's not a fast man.

202
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,963
Uh-- well, where is he now?

203
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,881
He's in the dean's office.

204
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,800
He has you listed

205
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,800
as the emergency contact,

206
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,551
so I just wanted

207
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,551
to let you know.

208
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,928
Well, uh-- thank you

209
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,972
so much for calling.

210
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,972
My pleasure.

211
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,683
If there's anything I can do,

212
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,683
feel free to reach out.

213
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,935
Or if you'd like to go

214
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,935
grab a coffee sometime,

215
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,436
I know a cute little cafe.

216
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,230
Do you like scones?

217
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:58,025
You're not actually trying

218
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:58,025
to hit on me right now, are you?

219
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,734
Is it working?

220
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,734
No.

221
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,778
I should go.

222
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,036
What kind of snacks

223
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,036
do you think I should serve

224
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,620
at my Nobel gathering?

225
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,957
It's on Swedish radio.

226
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,957
How about Swedish meatballs?

227
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,374
But it's at 5:00 a.m.

228
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,544
Swedish breakfast balls?

229
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,421
I could offer an assortment

230
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,421
of breakfast cereal.

231
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,591
My mom doesn't let me have

232
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,591
cereal with sugar in it.

233
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,053
Or anything that makes me happy.

234
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:35,187
Connie. What are you doing here?

235
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,856
Well...

236
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,901
I got a call

237
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,901
from your friend Linkletter,

238
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:45,613
and, uh... I-I was a

239
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:45,613
little worried about you.

240
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,199
What did he say?

241
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:50,035
That you had some

242
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:50,035
kind of scuffle

243
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,661
with the campus security?

244
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,038
No scuffle.

245
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,582
I was using

246
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,582
the university's mainframe,

247
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,252
and they asked me to leave.

248
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,252
Simple as that.

249
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,545
So nobody chased you?

250
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,714
I was startled, and so I did

251
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,633
what any normal person does

252
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,633
under the circumstances:

253
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:09,137
climb out a window

254
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:09,137
and run like the dickens.

255
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,601
KURT (over TV):

256
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,601
Hi, I'm Kurt Loder,

257
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,601
this is<i> MTV News...</i>

258
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,229
Since when do we get MTV?

259
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,897
Since I got cable.

260
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,233
What do you mean, you got cable?

261
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,651
I called up the cable company

262
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,651
and I said, "Hello,

263
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,071
I'd like cable,"

264
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,071
and they put in cable.

265
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,406
I'm not paying for that.

266
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,950
Keep your shirt on.

267
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,950
I paid for it.

268
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,159
Is that so?

269
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,870
Yeah, with money

270
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,870
I saved from my job.

271
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,539
Well, okay.

272
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,918
So do we get any

273
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,918
of those movie channels?

274
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,586
Dad, I'm trying

275
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,586
to watch the news.

276
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,339
KURT:

277
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,339
Billy Idol has recovered

278
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,339
so well from...

279
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,886
What's so important

280
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,886
that I had to run over here?

281
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,139
Come here. I want

282
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,139
to show you something.

283
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,685
Look at this.

284
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,896
John did it.

285
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,317
Oh, dear.

286
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,901
"Oh, dear" is right.

287
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,070
Was he in here taking a bath

288
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,572
and just started thinking

289
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,572
about science stuff?

290
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,908
Read the top right part.

291
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,786
MARY:

292
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,786
"Time plus heat

293
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,790
plus bread equals toast."

294
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,168
(whispers):

295
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,168
That ain't science.

296
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,420
Well, it's not wrong, either.

297
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,173
Look at this.

298
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,304
Yeah, well, that's... peculiar.

299
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,432
You'll be amazed to know

300
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,432
that the Nobel Prize,

301
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:38,018
while being the most prestigious

302
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:38,018
award in science,

303
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:40,354
is not generally celebrated

304
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:40,354
in this country.

305
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,647
No parades, no fireworks.

306
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,858
Which is why I thought having

307
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,858
a breakfast celebration

308
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,362
was not only appropriate,

309
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,362
but long overdue.

310
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,988
You may have noticed

311
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,988
that I went with Cheerios,

312
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,866
and believe me, it was

313
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,866
a decision that I came to

314
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,993
after careful consideration.

315
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,619
There were birds

316
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,619
on the Froot Loops,

317
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,206
Cocoa Puffs and Corn Flakes,

318
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,206
so they were out.

319
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,001
And leprechauns and elves

320
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,001
are magical creatures

321
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,171
that would be a slap in the face

322
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,171
to the scientific community.

323
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,008
Anyway, the festivities begin

324
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,008
at 4:30 a.m.

325
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,343
You're most welcome to come.

326
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,428
As are you, unhappy bag boy.

327
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,776
What the hell is this?

328
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,615
TV's asking me

329
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,615
for some kind of code.

330
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,576
Yeah, that's the

331
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,576
parental control lock.

332
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,578
So how do I take it off?

333
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,578
You don't.

334
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,373
This is my cable

335
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,373
that I bought with my money.

336
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,957
You got to be kidding me.

337
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,585
Here's an idea,

338
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,585
how about you go read a book?

339
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,380
Oh, this isn't over, little man.

340
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:53,343
Not by a long shot!

341
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,847
You know what I like

342
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,847
about you, Sheldon?

343
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,475
You're incredibly smart,

344
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,475
but you're also really dumb.

345
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,185
Why would you say that?

346
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,604
You think people are gonna

347
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,604
come here to hang out with you?

348
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,064
Yes.

349
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,525
To hear about science?

350
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,525
Yes.

351
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,069
On the radio?

352
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,069
Yes.

353
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,946
At 5:00 in the morning?

354
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,322
Yes.

355
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,990
And you're asking me

356
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,990
why you're dumb?

357
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,951
Well, I happen to have

358
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,951
a little more faith

359
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,578
in the curiosity

360
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,578
of my fellows.

361
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,330
See, you sound smart,

362
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,330
but you're still dumb.

363
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,665
I bet you don't even know

364
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,665
the first thing about Sweden.

365
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,126
Well, you're wrong,

366
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,835
it's where those little

367
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,835
meatballs come from.

368
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,382
And that chef on The Muppets.

369
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,382
That's two things.

370
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:33,674
Oh,

371
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:37,678
and is in Canada. That's three.

372
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,188
(phone ringing)

373
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,273
Hello?

374
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,732
Hello, Dr. Linkletter.

375
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:50,984
This is Connie Tucker.

376
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,445
Connie, how lovely

377
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,445
to hear from you.

378
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,196
Stop. I'm worried about John.

379
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,407
He was supposed to be here for

380
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,407
dinner and he never showed up.

381
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,868
That's not good. He also missed

382
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,868
two of his classes today.

383
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,121
Do you have any idea

384
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,121
where he might be?

385
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,540
Hard to say.

386

If he's having another episode,

387
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:06,916
he could be anywhere.

Hold on, what do you mean

389
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,169
"episode"?

Oh, I thought you knew.

391
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,878
In the past,

392
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,089
John has struggled

393
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,089
with his grip on reality.

394
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,509
What kind of struggle

395
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,509
are we talking about?

396
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,219
The kind where he's had

397
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,219
to be hospitalized.

398
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,973
Well, he never said anything

399
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,973
about that to me.

400
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,393
Well, I certainly wouldn't

401
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,393
fabricate such a story.

402
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:29,772
Okay, look, i-if-if you

403
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:29,772
hear from him or see him,

404
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,107
please let me know.

405
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,818
Of course.

406
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,818
Now, if down the road

407
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,987
things don't work out

408
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,987

409
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,448

Hello.

447

What-What're you doing?

448
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,674
I was doing tai chi

449
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,717
and then I realized

450
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,717
that I was

451
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,221
continually being bombarded

452
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,221
by subatomic particles

453
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,809
and it behooves me, perhaps,

454
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:14,061
to pay slightly closer

455
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:14,061
attention to them.

456
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:20,527
Maybe "chi" is the

457
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:20,527
ancient Chinese word

458
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,446
for the subatomic

459
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,446
universe.

460
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,949
You're scaring me, John.

461
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,828
Well, there's nothing

462
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,828
to be scared of.

463
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,665
Tomorrow, somebody will win

464
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,665
the Nobel Prize

465
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,709
about these

466
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,709
particles...

467
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,170
not me.

468
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:43,257
But I'm experiencing them

469
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:43,257
firsthand... (laughs)

470
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,385
...which could be better.

471
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,763
Why don't you come down

472
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,763
and experience them

473
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,181
on the floor?

474
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,643
I think I just felt

475
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,643
a neutrino. (laughing)

476
00:14:56,187 --> 00:15:00,400
You know, neutrinos

477
00:14:56,187 --> 00:15:00,400
are interesting.

478
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:04,237
They never bond with anything,

479
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,407
they're always alone.

480
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:12,119
I think that one went

481
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:12,119
right through my pants.

482
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,248
All right,

483
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,209
why don't we

484
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,209
go downstairs,

485
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,755
and I'll fix us both

486
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,755
a nice cup of hot tea

487
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:25,049
and you can tell me

488
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:25,049
all about it.

489
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:33,474
Please?

490
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,315
Okay.

491
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:56,205
It was my dream

492
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:56,205
to win the Nobel,

493
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,291
and I'm not going to.

494
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:04,881
I bet Sheldon will.

495
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:04,881

00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:07,926

497
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:07,926
Yeah.

Welcome to Radio Sweden...

501
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,446
How's it going, baby?

502
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:32,199
I don't think anyone's

503
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:32,199
showing up, not even Tam.

504
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,701
I'm here.

505
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:37,664
Yeah, but you're my mom.

506
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:37,664
You live on the premises.

507
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,375
At least Dr. Sturgis

508
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,375
should be here any minute.

509
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,671
Shelly, I'm afraid Dr. Sturgis

510
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,714
isn't coming this morning.

511
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,508
Why not?

512
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,220
He isn't feeling well.

513
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,975
Oh, dear.

514
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,393
Should we send him

515
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,393
a get well card?

516
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,938
I think that'd

517
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,938
be terrific.

518
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,439
JACOBSON:

519
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,439

00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,943
Academy of Sciences.

522
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,153
The announcements are starting.

523
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,031
You want me to stay?

524
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:15,785
JACOBSON: Uh, the Academy has

525
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:15,785
concluded its meeting and we are

526
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,286
ready to announce this year's...

527
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,497
I'll be in my room

528
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,497
if you need me.

529
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,377
JACOBSON:

530
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,377
As usual, I will read the

531
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,377
announcements first in English,

532
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,381
then in Swedish,

533
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,381

00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,012

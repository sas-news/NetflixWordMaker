1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:04,588
With us tonight is

2
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:04,588
Pastor Jeff Difford

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,424
from the First Baptist Church

4
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,424
of Medford.

5
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:09,050
Thank you

6
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:09,050
for being here, Pastor.

7
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,761
My pleasure.

8
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,761
So it would appear

9
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:12,513
that your church's

10
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,640
Halloween Hell House

11
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,640
has stirred up

12
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,851
quite a bit

13
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,851
of controversy this year.

14
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,727
Oh, I wouldn't call it

15
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,103
controversy.

16
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,229
What would you call it?

17
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,189
A-As you know,

18
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,565
the purpose of a Hell House

19
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,818
is to demonstrate

20
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,818
the wages of sin,

21
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,570
so as to lead people

22
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,570
back to God.

23
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:29,697
That's wonderful.

24
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,491
But doesn't it

25
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,491
concern you that a lot

26
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,201
of parents were alarmed

27
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,996
at the gruesome scenes

28
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,996
you portrayed?

29
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:41,375
Once again,

30
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:41,375
our intentions were pure.

31
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,878
Why don't we take a look

32
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,878
at just how pure they were.

33
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:44,920
Let's roll the clip.

34
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,588
Oh, boy.

35
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,965
I need another beer.

36
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,258
Oh, darling, don't you

37
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,258
think you've had enough?

38
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,887
I'll tell you

39
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,887
when I had enough!

40
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,887
(screams)

41
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:55,263
Whoa! Hey, cowboy,

42
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,516
why don't you put that

43
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,516
down and call it a night.

44
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:58,767
Don't you tell me

45
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:58,767
what to do.

46
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:02,396
(screaming)

47
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:06,692
JEFF:

48
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:06,692
That's enough, Peg.

49
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,988
Dear Lord.

50
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,990
As you can see,

51
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,990
our last attempt at a Hell House

52
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:15,659
may have been a tad...

53
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:15,659
traumatizing.

54
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,160
I thought it was a hoot.

55
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,705
Some of the little ones

56
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,705
peed their pants. (chuckles)

57
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,122
But that wasn't the goal.

58
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,500
A nine-year-old crapped

59
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,500
himself. (chuckles)

60
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,544
Why are you showing me this?

61
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,504
Well, Mary, this year,

62
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,504
we'd like to go

63
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,631
with a more family-friendly

64
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,631
production.

65
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,426
And I thought you'd be the

66
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,426
perfect person to head that up.

67
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,345
Really? Me?

68
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,222
Yes, you. Absolutely.

69
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,182
Gosh, I don't know.

70
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,182
(scoffs)

71
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,853
I always felt I had a flair

72
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,853
for the creative arts,

73
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:45,188
but putting on a

74
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:45,188
big show like that...

75
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,441
You'll have a sizable budget

76
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,441
and all the help you'll need

77
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,401
constructing sets,

78
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,401
building props,

79
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,779
special effects, makeup.

80
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,821
Does sound tempting.

81
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,197
But, most importantly,

82
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,825
you'll have an opportunity

83
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,825
to bring people to God

84
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,828
by vividly demonstrating

85
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,828
the perils of sin.

86
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,788
Be careful

87
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,122
if you touch on adultery.

88
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,208
Last year,

89
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,208
one of the actors got pregnant.

90
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,209
Thanks, Peg.

91
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,044
So, what do you say?

92
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,047
I already know the first change

93
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,047
I'm gonna make.

94
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:11,632
Instead of calling it

95
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:11,632
"Hell House,"

96
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,383
which is a little off-putting,

97
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:14,468
I'm gonna call it...

98
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,303
"Heck House."

99
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,220
Isn't that great?

100
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,472
That<i> is</i> great.

101
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,848
You don't

102
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,848
really mean that.

103
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,809
Yes, I do.

104
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,769
Oh, I get it.

105
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,145
Happy wife, happy life.

106
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,022
You need to stop talking.

107
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,440
So it's not

108
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,440
gonna be scary?

109
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,068
It will, but without

110
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,068
all the blood and gore.

111
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,945
But I like

112
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,945
blood and gore.

113
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,030
Hang on, y'all are trying

114
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,030
to scare people

115
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,364
into joining the church?

116
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,992
Yeah. But people like

117
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,534
getting scared

118
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,534
on Halloween anyway.

119
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,496
Why not make 'em jump

120
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,496
in the right direction?

121
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,998
Actually, fear has been

122
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,998
a recruiting tactic

123
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,415
used by organized religion

124
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:46,917
for centuries.

125
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,460
When you add guilt

126
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,460
to keep people in line,

127
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,088
it's an extremely efficient form

128
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,088
of crowd control.

129
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,967
Our religion is based on love,

130
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,967
Sheldon, not fear.

131
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,260
So what happens when people

132
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,260
don't follow the rules?

133
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,637
They burn in hell.

134
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,475
Because God loves 'em.

135
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,856
♪ Nobody else

136
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,856

(indistinct chatter)

143
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,965
Sheldon.

144
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,550
Oh. Hi, Georgie.

145
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,719
Why was Veronica

146
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,719
Duncan hugging you?

147
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,804
I'm tutoring her

148
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,804
in trigonometry.

149
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,514
And that gets you hugs?

150
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,725
Thanks to me,

151
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,725
she got her first C-minus.

152
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,268
Just between us,

153
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,268
she's a little slow.

154
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,812
That's not what I heard.

155
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:49,855
What did you hear?

156
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,272
Is she secretly clever?

157
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,817
Because if she is,

158
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,817
I completely missed it.

159
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:54,985
It doesn't matter.

160
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,444
You just need to

161
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,444
introduce me to her.

162
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,654
Why?

163
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,781
I want to be her friend.

164
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,116
Well, you better take a number.

165
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,743
She's friends with a lot of boys

166
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,743
around here.

167
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,079
Let me worry about that.

168
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,079
You just need to introduce us.

169
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,247
All right.

170
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,874
You know, she pays me

171
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,874
two dollars for every one

172
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,167
of our tutoring lessons.

173
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,044
How much did it cost

174
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,044
her to get a C-minus?

175
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:13,378
$26.

176
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,089
That's a good deal.

177
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,257
LUNDY: Now, remember,

178
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,257
next week, we start our work

179
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,841
on<i> Streetcar Named Desire.</i>

180
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,844
So please prepare a monologue

181
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,763
for either Blanche

182
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,763
or Stanley.

183
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,724
Usually, the girls do Blanche

184
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,724
and the boys do Stanley,

185
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,810
but no judgment--

186
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,810
you follow your heart.

187
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,312
(indistinct chatter)

188
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,065
Thank you again

189
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,275
for letting me come by

190
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,275
to pick your brain.

191
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,444
Oh, please.

192
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,444
Anything for the church.

193
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,987
Are you a religious man?

194
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,614
I'm an actor.

195
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,283
I'm whatever

196
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,283
you need me to be.

197
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,284
All right.

198
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,994
As I told you on the phone,

199
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,495
I have been tasked

200
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,207
with mounting this year's

201
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,207
Halloween production.

202
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,333
Oh, is that a haunted house

203
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,333
kind of deal?

204
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,129
Yes, but with the goal

205
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,129
of bringing people to God.

206
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,297
I do know something

207
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,297
about that.

208
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,592
When I played Puck

209
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,592
in<i> Midsummer,</i>

210
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,429
the<i> Tulsa Herald</i> called

211
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,429
my performance heavenly.

212
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,973
Wow! Good for you.

213
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,391
Thank you, thank you.

214
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,391
(giggling)

215
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,391
(chuckles)

216
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,936
Okay. Um, I was hoping

217
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,855
to put on a little play

218
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,855
in each of the rooms

219
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,691
that portrays one of

220
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,691
the seven deadly sins.

221
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,360
Pride, envy, gluttony, lust,

222
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,360
sloth, wrath and greed!

223
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,362
Wow, you know your sins!

224
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,531
Well, again, I'm an actor.

225
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,952
They are the tools in my box.

226
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,704
Um, have you

227
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,704
considered

228
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,623
a narrator, you know, um,

229
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,042
like, a tour guide

230
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,042
kind of thing?

231
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,710
Oh, that's interesting.

232
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,296
But who would that be?

233
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,298
Well, I'd have to think

234
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,298
the big man himself.

235
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:42,050
God?

236
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:42,050
Satan.

237
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,552
Oh! That's spooky.

238
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,764
And he's trying

239
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,764
to lure people toward sin.

240
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:48,932
Exactly.

241
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,475
That's a pretty big role.

242
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,893
I wonder who could do it.

243
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,270
Huh.

244
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,147
Well, it would

245
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,147
have to be someone

246
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:59,651
with enough range to

247
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:59,651
convey sincerity and charm,

248
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:03,613
all the while, hiding

249
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:03,613
a dark and corrupt soul!

250
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:04,906
(cackles)

251
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,449
Good golly.

252
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,449
(chuckles)

253
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,911
If you were just a little

254
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,911
taller, you'd be perfect.

255
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,288
I have lifts.

256
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,414
(indistinct chatter)

257
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,293
What are we doing here?

258
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,253
Waiting for Veronica.

259
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,378
How do you know she's in there?

260
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,006
It's kind of her homeroom.

261
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,758
Oh, hello again.

262
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,969
Oh.

263
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,969
(chuckles)

264
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,386
Hey. What's up?

265
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:30,515
This is my brother Georgie.

266
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:30,515
He wanted to meet you.

267
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,852
Really?

268
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,852
Really.

269
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,063
I like your hair.

270
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,397
Uh, me, too.

271
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,569
(crows cawing)

272
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,196
(engine shuts off)

273
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,447
What do you think?

274
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,991
Pretty great, huh?

275
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,285
Realtor's letting us

276
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,285
use it for free.

277
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,453
Wow. How'd you swing that?

278
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,580
Well, I promised

279
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:54,789
Fred Murphy a lead role

280
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,707
in the lust room.

281
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,126
Ooh.

282
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,126
(laughs)

283
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,128
Look at you,

284
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,128
just wheeling and dealing

285
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,463
like a big-time

286
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,463
Hollywood producer.

287
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,883
(chuckles)

288
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,883
Maybe you're

289
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,883
in the wrong business.

290
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,134
Being a mother?

291
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,136
Being a Christian.

292
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,136
Ah.

293
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,554
Greetings!

294
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,598
Oh, good! Mr. Lundy,

295
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,598
you made it.

296
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,598
(chuckles)

297
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,641
Oh, we're gonna be working

298
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,641
together. You can call me Gene.

299
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,228
All right, Gene, this

300
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,228
is my mother, Connie.

301
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,228
Hi.

302
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,645
Hi.

303
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,645
Hello.

304
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,606
Now, I would've bet

305
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,606
she was your big sister.

306
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,234
(chuckles)

307
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,234
I thought you said

308
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,234
he was a good actor.

309
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:23,610
Oh, now.

310
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:23,610
(chuckling)

311
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,195
So, what do you think?

312
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,864
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

313
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,864
Mm-hmm.

314
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,242
Spiderwebs.

315
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,242
What?

316
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,160
We're gonna need

317
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,160
some spiderwebs and I think

318
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,745
maybe some fire effects

319
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,745
on the left

320
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,455
and right side

321
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,455
of the portal.

322
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,331
Portal?

323
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,916
Portal to hell.

324
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,751
(chuckling)

325
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,751
Sure, sure.

326
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,379
Now, the script calls for me

327
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,379
to appear

328
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,505
from beneath the house

329
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,505
in a cloud of smoke.

330
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,050
But I think

331
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,050
that's gonna be ambitious.

332
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,509
Script? What script?

333
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,470
Oh, I wrote a script.

334
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,470
Don't worry about it.

335
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,680
I was gonna write the script.

336
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,515
Well, now you don't have to.

337
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,143
(chuckles)

338
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,270
(chuckles)

339
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,522
Do you believe this?

340
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,690
Believe it, love it,

341
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,152
glad I didn't wait

342
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,152
in the car.

343
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,953
I can't believe this.

344
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,622
No good?

345
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,622
It's awful.

346
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,000
It makes sin

347
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,000
seem like a good thing.

348
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,501
Well, that's the problem,

349
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,501
isn't it?

350
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,128
I mean, if sin didn't seem

351
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,128
like a good thing,

352
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,379
nobody would do it.

353
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,673
George, please, I'm in no mood.

354
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:27,924
Hey. Wrath.

355
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,302
That's one of the seven sins,

356
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,302
right?

357
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,428
Pastor Jeff gave me this project

358
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,138
because he knew

359
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,138
I'd be best at it.

360
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,640
Now Gene... Lundy

361
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,640
is taking over.

362
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,352
Oh, look, pride. And envy.

363
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,937
Don't stop. Four sins to go.

364
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,234
I'm guessing lust

365
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,234
ain't happening tonight.

366
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,241
You see a large red button.

367
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,575
What do you do?

368
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,412
I press it.

369
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,501
The floor opens up and

370
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,501
you plunge into a 60-foot pit.

371
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,169
I fly out.

372
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,254
Up, up, and away!

373
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:09,174
Again, you're not Superman

374
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:09,174
in<i> this</i> game;

375
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,301
you're Superman for Halloween.

376
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,094
Which isn't till next week.

377
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,471
So I'm in a pit.

378
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:15,847
You're in a pit.

379
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,559
Then I blast my way out

380
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,559
with my super breath!

381
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,768
(blowing)

382
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,063
Just let him do it.

383
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,356
Dinner's ready.

384
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,149
Five more minutes.

385
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,149
Hey, Georgie.

386
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,443
I saw you talking

387
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,443
to Veronica Duncan.

388
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,944
Yeah. So?

389
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,154
How well do you know her?

you are the

427
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:28,836
personification of lust.

428
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:33,383
Your sole reason for being

429
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:33,383
is to try to satisfy

430
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:37,678
this unquenchable thirst

431
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:37,678
for physical pleasure.

432
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,433
Great. Will there be

433
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,433
kissing and touching?

434
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,935
Oh, you bet.

435
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,935
Mm. Mm.

436
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,020
Now what?

437
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,731
Pretend kissing.

438
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,731
Pretend touching.

439
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,983
Oh.

440
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,027
Fred, would you just

441
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,027
give me a moment?

442
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,364
Mary, I-I've tried

443
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,364
to be patient,

444
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,865
but if I'm gonna do this,

445
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,368
put my reputation

446
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,368
on the line,

447
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,996
I'm gonna need you

448
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,996
to back off just a little bit.

449
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:06,040
Do I need to remind you that

450
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:06,040
the purpose of<i> Heck House</i>

451
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,376
is to show how sins

452
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,376
destroy our lives?

453
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,628
Yeah, so?

454
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,297
You are making them

455
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,297
into a good thing.

456
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,257
Have you read the script?

457
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,717
He's gonna get syphilis.

458
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,428
He goes home,

459
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,428
he gives it to his wife.

460
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,804
She goes crazy.

461
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,140
She kills him

462
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,140
and her entire family.

463
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,891
What am I missing?

464
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,018
Sorry I'm late.

465
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,769
I couldn't find my keys,

466
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,729
and then my car

467
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,729
wouldn't start.

468
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,106
Then I got lost.

469
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,650
Holy smokes.

470
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,152
Hi. Are you

471
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,152
my make out partner?

472
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,738
No. No. No one's making out.

473
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,575
This all stops right now.

474
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,202
You have got to calm down.

475
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,496
I will not have innocent

476
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,496
children walk through this house

477
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,581
on Halloween and see

478
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,581
a half-naked woman.

479
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,292
A half-naked woman

480
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,292
chock-full of syphilis.

481
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:53,087
BOTH:

482
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:53,087
What?

483
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:53,087
It's pretend syphilis.

484
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,883
Mary, I am a trained

485
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,883
theater professional.

486
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:02,180
Why don't you just let me

487
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:02,180
do what I do, while you,

488
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:06,767
you know, go home and make

489
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:06,767
a nice tuna casserole.

490
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,478
Hmm?

491
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,854
All right, Fred...

492
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,023
ADULT SHELDON:

493
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,023
<i>I know what you're thinking:</i>

494
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,525
<i>she's going to tear</i>

495
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,525
<i>his throat out.</i>

496
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,818
<i>But what in fact happened</i>

497
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,818
<i>is she did</i>

498
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,487
<i>what she thought Jesus</i>

499
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,487
<i>would do.</i>

500
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,738
<i>She went home and made</i>

501
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,738
<i>that tuna casserole.</i>

502
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,157
<i>It was a little salty</i>

503
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,117
<i>but I ate it</i>

504
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,117
<i>because she was in a mood.</i>

505
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,539
KIDS:

506
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,539
Trick or treat!

507
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,915
(laughter)

508
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,292
(eerie organ music playing)

509
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,962
(recorded screams playing)

510
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,428
(gasping, laughing)

511
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:45,390
Greetings.

512
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:45,390
Pleased to meet you.

513
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:49,060
I go by many names:

514
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:49,060
Satan, Lucifer,

515
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,522
Mephistopheles,

516
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,522
Beelzebub.

517
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,357
Of course, when I make

518
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,357
a dinner reservation,

519
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,943
I-I go by "Eric."

520
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,445
It's easier to spell.

521
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,154
Before we begin

522
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,324
tonight's descent into<i> Heck,</i>

523
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,202
I'd like to tell you

524
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,202
a little about myself.

525
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:09,372
'Cause it's all about you,

526
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:09,372
isn't it?

527
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,125
I was God's chosen angel.

528
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,335
I was his favorite.

529
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,379
We used to go camping together.

530
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:20,091
But then, because I wanted

531
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:20,091
to have a little bit of fun,

532
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,801
I was cast from heaven.

533
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,388
Tonight, you will bear witness

534
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,388
to that fun.

535
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:31,018
<i>You</i> will decide

536
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:31,018
whether it is sinful...

537
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,895
or just another Saturday night.

538
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:37,317
(laughs)

539
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:37,317
Come with me... if you dare.

540
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,860
(thunder rumbles)

541
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,404
Just watch your step

542
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,404
right over here,

543
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,448
'cause there's some

544
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,448
electrical wires.

545
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,116
(hisses)

546
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,116
<i>(knock on door)</i>

547
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,034
ALL:

548
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,034
Trick or treat.

549
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,704
Oh, look how cute y'all are.

550
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:53,374
Now, I know you are Superman.

551
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,501
What about the rest of you?

552
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,211
I'm Cyndi Lauper.

553
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,211
I'm a wizard.

554
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,338
Uh-huh.

555
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,131
And I'm Carl Sagan.

556
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,008
Who?

557
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,510
Carl Sagan.

558
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,512
He's the host of<i> Cosmos.</i>

559
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,097
Well, isn't that something.

560
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,141
Now, y'all be safe

561
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,141
and have a fun night.

562
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,392
I'm Super...

563
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,687
(laughter, shouting)

564
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,192
You like Guns N' Roses?

565
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,360
They're all right.

566
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,404
Yeah, they're all right.

567
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,579
You as smart

568
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,579
as your brother?

569
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,498
Nobody is.

570
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,916
I got an older sister

571
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,916
that's kind of a genius.

572
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,418
Oh, yeah?

573
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,586
Why didn't she tutor you?

574
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,505
She's in jail.

575
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,174
What'd she do?

576
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,759
She sold a piñata

577
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,759
full of weed

578
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,386
to an undercover cop.

579
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,638
Doesn't sound like

580
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,638
much of a genius.

581
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,266
Oh, I don't know, she

582
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,266
graduated high school.

583
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,018
BILLY:

584
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,018
Ooh, peanut butter cups!

585
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,896
Superman loves

586
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,896
peanut butter cups!

587
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,857
(thunder rumbles)

588
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,526
So you see, the sin of greed.

589
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:04,696
Very wealthy man,

590
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:04,696
a beautiful house,

591
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,240
swimming pool,

592
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,240
several German cars,

593
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,618
and a young wife

594
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,618
who worshipped him.

595
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,286
Excuse me, Mr. Satan.

596
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,831
What?

597
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,040
You kind of left out

598
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,667
how greed is the root

599
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,667
of all evil,

600
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,085
and how it corrupts

601
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,085
the soul.

602
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,212
It's in there.

603
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,212
It's called subtext.

604
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,424
Why don't we take a gander

605
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,424
at the eternal torment

606
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,592
that is sloth.

607
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,386
Eh!

608
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,638
I can't believe

609
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,638
no one in this town knows

610
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,181
who Carl Sagan is.

611
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,808
Why even have a TV?

612
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,061
Stupid Mrs. Gifford

613
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,061
gave me a banana.

614
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,021
SHELDON:

615
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,021
Where's Billy?

616
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,440
He had to go

617
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,440
to the bathroom.

618
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,233
So he went home?

619
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,233
No.

620
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,277
He's right behind

621
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,277
that tree.

622
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,529
Wait up, guys.

623
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,115
Oh, I got a little on my cape.

624
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,659
Ew.

625
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,585
There's nobody at my house.

626
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,585
You want to come over?

627
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:01,836
Yes.

628
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,713
Okay, let's go.

629
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,469
(ethereal music playing)

630
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,265
Look at this.

631
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,477
We threw a party for heaven

632
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,477
and nobody came.

633
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,855
Not one person

634
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,855
chose to be saved.

635
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,690
Well, did you tell 'em

636
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,690
about the cupcakes?

637
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,150
MEEMAW:

638
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,150
Where I think you went wrong

639
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,652
is in your timing.

640
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,696
If you'd done this deal

641
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,696
during a war or a plague,

642
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,698
then you'd have

643
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,698
a boatload of converts.

644
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,366
Famine.

645
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,366
Famine would bring 'em in.

646
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,452
What do you know about famine?

647
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,288
Hola, amigos.

648
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,624
Hey, Pastor Jeff.

649
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,042
Why so glum?

650
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,042
This is going great.

651
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,420
Donations are through the roof.

652
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:45,713
(laughs)

653
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,047
Nobody wants to be saved.

654
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,927
Yeah, but donations are

655
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,927
through the roof.

656
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,387
Is that all this means to you,

657
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,387
raising money?

658
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,098
Hey, that money is

659
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,098
gonna do a lot of good

660
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,433
for a lot of people.

661
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,310
Now, quit being

662
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,310
such a fun sponge.

663
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,521
Here, have some grapes.

664
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,272
(laughing)

665
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,862
What's that?

666
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,320
Some stupid haunted house

667
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,073
my mother's doing

668
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,073
for the church.

669
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,992
Let's check it out.

670
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,619
But I-I thought we were

671
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,619
going to your house.

672
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,122
We are, let's just

673
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,122
do this first.

674
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,665
It'll be fun.

675
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,711

676
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,089
Pleased to meet you.

thought about the choices

686
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,644

Her youth was gone.

692

beauty for a few

694
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:55,074

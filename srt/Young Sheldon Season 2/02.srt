00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:02,961
<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,254
I've been corresponding

3
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,254
with Dr. John Sturgis

4
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:05,631
<i>at East Texas Tech.</i>

5
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:07,132
<i>He said I could audit</i>

6
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:07,132
<i>his course.</i>

7
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,383
I'm John Sturgis.

8
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,302
Sheldon invited me to dinner.

9
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:13,180
Spaghetti and hot dogs

10
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:13,180
is delightful.

11
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,515
You're only here temporarily?

12
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,475
That's the plan for now,

13
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:20,020
but I could be enticed to stay.

14
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,522
I do believe there

15
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,522
was subtext there.

16
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,857
Did you pick up on it?

17
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:27,444
Okay. I'll see you later.

18
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,404
Are you sure

19
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,404
you don't want to stay with me?

20
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,907
I don't think so. I don't really

21
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,907
understand this stuff.

22
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,450
That's how I felt

23
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,450
when we watched<i> Dirty Dancing,</i>

24
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:34,952
and I stayed.

25
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:36,787
When Patrick Swayze

26
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:36,787
takes his shirt off in here,

27
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,831
I'll be back.

28
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,831
You have a good one.

29
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,256
Hello.

30
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,508
Hi.

31
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,802
Who are you?

32
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:53,012
I'm Paige.

33
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:54,805
I like your bow tie.

34
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,139
Thank you.

35
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,808
You seem awfully young,

36
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,808
Paige.

37
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,019
Are you with an adult

38
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,019
who's taking this class?

39
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,646
No. Dr. Sturgis heard

40
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,646
about my research

41
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:04,815
on quantum chromodynamics

42
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:04,815
at high temperatures

43
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:07,067
and invited me

44
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:07,067
to audit his course.

45
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,318
Is that so?

46
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,696
Yes. He's been super nice.

47
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,198
Interesting. Well,

48
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,198
just so we're clear,

49
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,743
he's my mentor,

50
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,743
he's my meemaw's boyfriend,

51
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,495
and he had spaghetti

52
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,495
and hot dogs at my house.

53
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,582
(chuckling): The spaghetti

54
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,582
goes on the hot dogs?

55
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,958
No.

56
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,626
You realize

57
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,626
this is a very advanced class.

58
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,127
We'll be discussing

59
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,296
deriving nuclear physics

60
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,296
from the quark model.

61
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,132
Do you know if he'll be doing

62
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,132
a full color octet calculation

63
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,968
with matrix manipulations?

64
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,094
I do not.

65
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,556
Do you know how to differentiate

66
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,556
under the integral sign?

67
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,433
No.

68
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,143
(chuckles):

69
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,143
Well, do you know anything?

70
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,022

I'm younger than him.

90
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,903
How come you never mentioned

91
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,903
she was coming to this class?

92
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,155
I thought it would be

93
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,155

94
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,615
I don't like surprises.

96
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,576
Then why did you do it?

97
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,578
Some people like surprises.

98
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,080
I love surprises.

99
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:44,539

00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:48,167
Yes.

I'm unfamiliar with.

114
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,112
Hmm. Think it might

115
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,112
have something to do

116
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:16,237
with your new classmate?

117
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,781
It's possible.

118
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,950
She's the only variable

120
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,494
So what are you feeling?

121
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,496
My face is hot,

122
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,123
I've a knot in my stomach,

123
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,542
and I'm resisting the urge

124
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,542
to kick your seat right now.

125
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,836
I'm thinking it

126
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,836
might be jealousy.

127
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,462
No, that's not in my nature.

128
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,756
All right, let's go through

129
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,756
all the emotions.

130
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,800
I'm looking at your face,

131
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,886
so I'm gonna rule out happy.

132
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,637
Are you sad?

133
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,472
No, there's too much anger

134
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,472
in there.

135
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,849
Oh, well, maybe you're angry.

136
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,600
No, there's too much sad

137
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,600
in there.

138
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,144
Maybe you got a little crush

139
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,144
on her.

140
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,104
Do you<i> want</i> me

141
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,104

142
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,272
I don't know, Moonpie.

143
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,525
I'm still thinking

144
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,525
it might be jealousy.

145
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:57,071
Give me one reason

146
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:57,071
why I would be jealous.

147
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,489
Well, Dr. Sturgis

148
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,489
means a lot to you,

149
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,491

150
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,491
attention to somebody else.

151
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,827

153
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,746

the possibility...

156
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,957

Hello, Mary.

162

This is John Sturgis,

Sheldon's professor

164
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,262

165
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,306
Hi. And "John"

166
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,306
was more than enough.

167
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,518
I was calling because there's

168
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,518
a new student in my class

169
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,895
who's Sheldon's age.

170
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,479
No kidding.

171
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,150
Her mother wondered if I could

172
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,150
put you two in contact

173
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,277

175
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,030

176
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,489

177
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,324
I'll give you the number

00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,545
Yes?

184
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:56,880
That's my number.

185
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,132

186
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,134

what this means?

190
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:10,477
Rather than me feel dumb,

191
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:10,477
how about you just tell me?

192
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:14,064

00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,733
Yeah, sure.

195
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,733
All the times we wonder

196
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,360
if we're doing right by Sheldon

197
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,360
or how to handle him,

198
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,446
we finally have someone

199
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,446
to compare notes with.

200
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,781
There's notes?

201
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,241
(chuckles):

202
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,241
I just been winging it.

203
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,534
I'm gonna call her right now.

204
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,534
Sounds good.

205
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,995
(squeals)

206
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,830
Oh, thank you, Lord,

207
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,830
for connecting us

208
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,291
with the parents

209
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,291
of another special child.

210
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,379
You kids are special, too.

211
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,966
Do you feel special?

212
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,010
At least

213
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,010
I'm the only daughter.

214
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,636
You got nothing.

215
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,429
SHELDON:

216
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,429
And she's such a know-it-all.

217
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,806
Yeah, you mentioned that.

218
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,516
I'm surprised her

219
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,516
arm wasn't sore

220
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,976
from raising her hand so much.

221
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,227
Yep, sure.

222
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,021
And who goes to college

223
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,021
with stickers

224
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,605
on their notepad?

225
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:56,815
I don't know.

226
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,650
<i>Unicorn</i> stickers.

227
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,527
And we're home.

228
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,862
Hey, Shelly.

229
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,655
Guess who's coming

230
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,655
over tomorrow?

231
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,241
Your new friend Paige.

232
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,409
Okay, I'm gonna go.

233
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,625
Come on, Shelly. Maybe

234
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,625
you'll end up being friends.

235
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,044
I don't like her,

236
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,419
I'm not going to like her,

237
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,419
and Tam is my friend.

238
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,713
I don't need another one.

239
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,756
You can have more

240
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,756
than one friend.

241
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,884
I'm sure Tam

242
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,884
has other friends.

243
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,552
No, I'm all he's got.

244
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,929
And even I avoid him

245
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,929
half the time.

246
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,057
Also, you don't have

247
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,057
any friends.

248
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,599
Why are you so worried about me?

249
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,102
I have friends.

250
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,813
Then how come the only person

251
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,813
who ever comes over is Meemaw?

252
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,148
Because...

253
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,816
Okay, this isn't about me.

254
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:43,070
So Paige didn't make a

255
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:43,070
good first impression,

256
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,238
but that can change.

257
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,532
What's that new<i> Star Trek</i> show?

258
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,450
<i>Next Generation?</i>

259
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,953
When that first came on,

260
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,953
you said a new<i> Star Trek</i>

261
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,539
without Dr. Spock

262
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,539
could never be good,

263
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,708
but I've seen you watching it.

264
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,127
Well, first of all,

265
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,127
it's Mr. Spock.

266
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,462
Dr. Spock writes books

267
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,462
about babies.

268
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,964
My apologies.

269
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,384
And second of all,

270
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,384
Paige isn't a TV show.

271
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,427
She's a person, and we all know

272
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,427
how I feel about people.

273
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,097
(blows raspberry)

274
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,809
(sighs)

275
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,061
Okay, look.

276
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,354
You're right.

277
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,651
I don't have many friends,

278
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:27,739
so I was hoping

279
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:27,739
to get to know Paige's mom.

280
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,494
But if it makes you

281
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,494
uncomfortable,

282
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,331
then I will call her

283
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,331
and cancel.

284
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,837
I'll think about it.

285
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,632
Thank you, baby.

286
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,135
ADULT SHELDON:<i> Guilt</i>

287
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,135
<i>and jealousy in the same day.</i>

288
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,595
<i>I slept hard that night.</i>

289
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,890
Mmm.

290
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:57,894
Did you know that there's a type

291
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:57,894
of vanilla flavoring

292
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,439
derived from the anal glands

293
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,982
of the North American beaver?

294
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,151
That seems like a fact

295
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,151
you could have shared

296
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,568
before we started eating.

297
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,404
It isn't used very often.

298
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:11,408
I understand it's difficult

299
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:11,408
to, uh, milk the little sacs.

300
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,161
Cool. Okay, new topic.

301
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,121
Let's talk about Sheldon.

302
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,373
Wonderful. What about him?

303
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,709
He's having kind of a hard time

304
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,709
with the new girl in your class.

305
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,503
Really? Why?

306
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,381
He's jealous of the attention

307
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,381
you're paying her.

308
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,925
Well, she's remarkable.

309
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,885
You see that? Less of that.

310
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,929
But I think

311
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,929
he's remarkable, too.

312
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,847
Perfect. More of that,

313
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,847
less of the other one.

314
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,724
Understood.

315
00:08:36,765 --> 00:08:39,477
See, this is why

316
00:08:36,765 --> 00:08:39,477
we're great together.

317
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,938
You teach me

318
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,938
about social etiquette,

319
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,483
and I teach you

320
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,483
about beaver anuses.

321
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,485
(chuckles):

322
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,485
It is magical.

323
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,655
Did you know "ani"

324
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,655
is also acceptable

325
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,282
as the plural of "anus"?

326
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,701
And the magic continues.

327
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,204

Mr. Spock,

339
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,970

00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:29,069
that the healthy release

of emotion

349
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,030

00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,625
The release of emotions,

387
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,625
Mr. Spock,

388
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,544
is what keeps us healthy.

389
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:30,464
<i>Dr. McCoy was an idiot.</i>

390
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,842
Well, you just have

391
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,842
a beautiful home.

392
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,137
Thank you.

393
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,137
Can I interest anyone

394
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,638
in something stronger

395
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,638
than iced tea?

396
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,515
Oh, well, I'll take a beer

397
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,515
if you have one.

398
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,392
Don't worry.

399
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,392
He's personally keeping

400
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,936
the Lone Star Brewing Company

401
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,936
in business.

402
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,020
(laughing)

403
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,439
They did send me a belt buckle.

404
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,399
(chuckling)

405
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,399
Be right back.

406
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,693
So, Barry, uh,

407
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,693
Linda tells me

408
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,362
you're a dentist?

409
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,362
Uh, yes.

410
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,030
I have a practice up

411
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,030
in Jasper.

412
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,825
Uh, Paige actually does some

413
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,825
of the bookkeeping for us.

414
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,076
That's so funny.

415
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,453
Sheldon does our taxes.

416
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,580
Oh!

417
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,580
(chuckles)

418
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,580
Yeah, we used to pay her

419
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:04,872
in stickers,

420
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:04,872
but, this year,

421
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,374
she actually started

422
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,374
asking for money.

423
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,875
Well, don't let Sheldon

424
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,875
hear that.

425
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,127
We pay him in binder clips.

426
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,045
(chuckles)

427
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,045
He loves being

428
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,045
organized.

429
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,713
Boy, does he.

430
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,466
We can't go to the grocery store

431
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,466
without him making sure

432
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,510
that all the labels

433
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,510
are facing the right way.

434
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:20,013
Oh, the stock boys there

435
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:20,013
are always so happy to see him.

436
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,055
(laughing)

437
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,474
That's adorable.

438
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,474
Well,

439
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,559
it wasn't adorable

440
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,559
when we redid our shower

441
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,479
and he wouldn't use it 'cause

442
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,479
two of the tiles were crooked.

443
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,896
He took baths

444
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,896
in the sink

445
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,231
until we got it fixed.

446
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,066
(laughing)

447
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,320
So does Paige do

448
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,320
any quirky stuff like that?

449
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,615
No.

450
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,615
Not really.

451
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,033
Oh.

452
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,995
Now, since we'll be spending

453
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,995
a few hours together,

454
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,498
I've created a list of

455
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,498
activities to keep us occupied.

456
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,915
We'll start with

457
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,915
a tour of my room,

458
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,001
then board games,

459
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,001
and, if time permits,

460
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,337
you can look at

461
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,337
and not touch my trains.

462
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,963
Oh, My Little Pony.

463
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,965
I love My Little Pony.

464
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,301
That's my sister's,

465
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,301
and it's not part of the tour.

466
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,220
I share a room

467
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,220
with my sister, too.

468
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,638
It's super fun.

469
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,014
You're wrong.

470
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,559
Now, over here, we have my desk.

471
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,687
This is my computer.

472
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,687
That's my mouse.

473
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,398
This is my printer. This is the

474
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,398
paper that goes in the printer.

475
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,274
This is a box of extra paper

476
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,026
that also goes

477
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,026
in the printer.

478
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:19,406
And this is my signed picture

479
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:19,406
of Professor Proton.

480
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,200
Do you watch his show?

481
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,494
No. I don't

482
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,494
really like it.

483
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,287
You don't?

484
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,664
I think he's boring.

485
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,875
And he dumbs everything down.

486
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,920
ADULT SHELDON:<i> Come on,</i>

487
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,920
Kolinahr,<i> don't fail me now.</i>

488
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,797
And next on the tour,

489
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,797
we have...

490
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,633
a lamp.

491
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,720
(sighs)

492
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,305
(quietly): This is not

493
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,305
making me feel better.

494
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,682
Their kid is perfect.

495
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:46,974
And so is ours.

496
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,477
So we're lying to

497
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,477
each other. Fine.

498
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,812
It's just nice to get to know

499
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,812
another family

500
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,232
who's in a similar situation

501
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,232
as us.

502
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,568
And we're still lying.

503
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,568
(sighs)

504
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,906
What grade

505
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,906
are you in?

506
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,658
Eighth.

507
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,909
You?

508
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,578
Tenth.

509
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,995
Cool.

510
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,082
Nobody asked, but fourth.

511
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,919
Why do grownups do this?

512
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,171
They love to stick random kids

513
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,171
together

514
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,132
and expect them

515
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,132
to just be friends.

516
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,301
I know. I hate that.

517
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,594
Fresh Prince is right.

518
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,220
Parents just don't understand.

519
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,013
(chuckles)

520
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,013
I love that song.

521
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,390
MISSY: I have a

522
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,390
cassette of it,

523
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,643
but I recorded it off the radio.

524
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,060
You can hear Sheldon

525
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,060
in the background

526
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:34,105
saying stuff

527
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:34,105
about Sir Isaac Neutron.

528
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,191
Ugh, my sister's

529
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,191
always talking about him.

530
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,735
I don't know why.

531
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,403
I think he's dead.

532
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,614
You have no idea

533
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,614
how much it sucks

534
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,198
to have a brother

535
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,198
like him.

536
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,367
Believe it or not,

537
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,367
he's in my class.

538
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,287
My parents sent Paige

539
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,287
to a private school.

540
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,332
Cool. We're too

541
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,332
poor for that.

542
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,044
(sighs)

543
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,423
Does Sheldon

544
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,423
make you feel stupid?

545
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,467
Nah, I'm smart in other ways.

546
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,968
Me, too.

547
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,804
Hey, I saw an old TV

548
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,804
in the alley.

549
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:06,971
Want to go throw rocks at it?

550
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,557
Cool!

551
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,557
Hell yeah!

552
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,557
Let's do it.

553
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,851
We could play traditional chess.

554
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,354
Or if you're interested,

555
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,354
we could play a variant

556
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,481
with a new piece I invented.

557
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,816
That sounds fun.

558
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,734
What's the new piece?

559
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,152
A wizard.

560
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,903
The wizard cannot be taken,

561
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,903
and, at any point,

562
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,282
he can teleport and switch

563
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,282
places with any other piece.

564
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,368
Yes, but there's

565
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,368
an obvious flaw.

566
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,329
What flaw?

567
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,329
Well, any time

568
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,329
anyone is checkmated,

569
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,956
they can simply have the wizard

570
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,956
and their king switch places.

571
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,000
So the game will never end.

572
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,212
I knew that.

573
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,212
You passed my test.

574
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,131
We told Paige

575
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,131
that if she won

576
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,758
the regional spelling bee,

577
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,758
she could get a puppy.

578
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,092
We ended up with two,

579
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,094
'cause she won twice.

580
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,094
(chuckles)

581
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,263
(chuckles):

582
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,263
Fun! That-That's fun.

583
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,516
BARRY:

584
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,516
All right,

585
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,684
that's enough about Paige.

586
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,686
So, George, I know you're

587
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:55,978
a football coach.

588
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,271
What about you, Mary?

589
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,981
I work part-time at the church.

590
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,441
Oh.

591
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,441
Oh, that's so nice.

592
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,901
I used to work at the

593
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,901
practice with Barry,

594
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,111
but I had to quit

595
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,111
once Paige's schedule

596
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,279
started to get busy.

597
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,279
Mm.

598
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,781
Well, that's understandable.

599
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,492
A unique child

600
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,492
can require a lot of attention.

601
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,618
(Barry chuckles)

602
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,912
Mm. Try all

603
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,912
the attention. Hmm?

604
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,707
(chuckles): Okay. You know

605
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,707
that's not true, Barry.

606
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,707
Well...

607
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,291
(chuckles)

608
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,291
She's...

609
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,710
she's right. It's not.

610
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,545
Although I did spend

611
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,545
Father's Day alone

612
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,630
'cause she took Paige

613
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,630
to a robotics show.

614
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,090
Okay. That's

615
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,090
enough, Barry.

616
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,884
They don't need

617
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,884
to hear all this.

618
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,510
(chuckles)

619
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,510
GEORGE SR.: That's okay.

620
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,969
(stammers) That's why

621
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,969
we're getting together,

622
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,639
you know, talk about

623
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,639
this kind of stuff.

624
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,475
Barry, it sounds like

625
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,475
you might be feeling left out.

626
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,935
Oh.

627
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,935
(chuckles) No.

628
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,228
(laughs)

629
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,605
Sometimes I do.

630
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,523
And it's not just me.

631
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,523
It's Erica, too.

632
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,067
Oh, now he's just

633
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,067
being dramatic.

634
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,444
Erica gets a lot

635
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,444
of attention,

636
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,821
and she's just a joy.

637
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,821
(chuckles)

638
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,742
Dang it, the

639
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,742
screen won't break.

640
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,702
Bet it'll break

641
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,702
if we blow it up.

642
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,251
(whispers):

643
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,251
I love her.

644
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,586
Fine, you're right.

645
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:02,837
Erica's doing just great.

646
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,464
Nothing to worry about there.

647
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,882
(chuckles)

648
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,219
ERICA:

649
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,219
Oh, come on.

650
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,556
You got any matches?

651
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,099
Be right back.

652
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,523
While she's gone,

653
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,523
you want to make out?

654
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,942
Sure.

655
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,612
You actually believe

656
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,612
in the multiverse theory?

657
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:28,863
Very much so.

658
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,490
It's the most elegant

659
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,490
interpretation

660
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,241
of quantum mechanics.

661
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:35,703
So you really think there are

662
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:35,703
an infinite number of universes?

663
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,665
Stephen Hawking believes it,

664
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,665
so, yes, I do.

665
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,084
Well, if there are

666
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,084
an infinite number of universes,

667
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,629
I think that theory's dumb

668
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,629
in all of them.

669
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,047
(chuckles)

670
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,633
This is fun.

671
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,009
I don't get to have

672
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,009
discussions like this

673
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,302
with kids at my school.

674
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,679
Do you?

675
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,473
No.

676
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,525
Do you ever wish you were

677
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,525
just like everyone else?

678
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,902
Not at all.

679
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,529
(chuckles)

680
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,529
Me neither.

681
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,906
I love being smarter

682
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,906
than everyone. (chuckles)

683
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,616

what happens to quarks

to make mesons and baryons?

731
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,721
Yes, Paige.

732
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,556
We can ignore

733
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,556
the particle masses

734
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,391
at the individual quark level.

735
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,226
Correct.

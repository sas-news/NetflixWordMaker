Yeah.

32
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:45,086
I was thinking about having her

00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:45,086

No.

39
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,637
What's going on?

40
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,305
Her mother's boyfriend has

a drinking problem,

42
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:59,059

So good news.

49
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,820
We're gonna have a houseguest

Her beard is very scratchy.

53
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,449
My sister doesn't have a beard.

54
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,492

66
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,552
She can have my room.

00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:18,693
(quietly):

198
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:18,693
Oh, my Lord...

199
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,947
And this is the dining room.

200
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,947
That's where we'll dine.

201
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,616
But in the mornings,

202
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,616
we dine in the kitchen.

203
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,993
Of course, if you'd

204
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,993
like a snack,

205
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,411
that'd be in the

206
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,411
refrigerator or the pantry.

207
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,914
You know, where

208
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,914
your snack foods would be.

209
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,914
Sure.

210
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,499
Washer, dryer.

211
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,918
Plus, we got those

212
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,918
little sheets that smell nice

213
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,254
and fight

214
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,254
static cling.

215
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,383
And here's our

216
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,383
entertainment room.

217
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,383
Hey, guys.

218
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,551
Hi.

219
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,551
Hello.

220
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,095
We don't have cable,

221
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,095
but we do have

222
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:49,141
all three major

223
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:49,141
broadcast networks.

224
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:58,942
Here's the bathroom,

225
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:58,942
for hygiene and whatnot.

226
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,029
And... here's where

227
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,029
you'll be sleeping.

228
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,364
Did I take your room?

229
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,364
Yes,

230
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,867
but I'll be

231
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,867
on the couch.

232
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,660
Which is right near

233
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,660
the TV and the kitchen,

234
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,995
so I'm peachy.

235
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,082
(Spanish music playing)

236
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,877
Hello. I'm John Sturgis.

237
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,212
We have a reservation.

238
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,921
Follow me.

239
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,965
♪ ♪

240
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,969
(quietly):

241
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,969
Was a reservation

242
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,969
really necessary?

243
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,638
I didn't want to take

244
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,638
any chances.

245
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,638
(chuckles)

246
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,182
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

247
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,641
I sit in that seat.

248
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:32,893
You sit here.

249
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,312
Oh, uh, okay.

250
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,650
What's going on?

251
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,069
Don't you remember?

252
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,987
John, I don't even remember

253
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,987
where I just parked.

254
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,032
I'm recreating our first date!

255
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:50,285
The same restaurant,

256
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:50,285
the same table,

257
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,494
the same jacket.

258
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,330
Different eyelashes,

259
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,330
though, because

260
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,456
they regenerate

261
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,456
every two to three months.

262
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,750
Mine are the

263
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,750
same, actually.

264
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,709
They're fake.

265
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,961
(both laugh)

266
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,382
I wanted this night

267
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,382
to be special

268
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:07,844
because it's the one-year

269
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:07,844
anniversary of that date.

270
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,347
Is that a thing that people

271
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,347
our age celebrate?

272
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,141
No idea.

273
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,141
I've never been this age before.

274
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,894
And I've never dated anyone

275
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,894
for a whole year.

276
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,146
(chuckles)

277
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,146
Well...

278
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,899
Happy anniversary.

279
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,899
(chuckles)

280
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,652
(classical music playing)

281
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,493
Sorry for the mess.

282
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,330
I emptied out this drawer

283
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,330
so you can put your stuff away.

284
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,165
Where are

285
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,165
your clothes?

286
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,292
I threw most of them out.

287
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,709
You didn't have

288
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,709
to do that.

289
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,669
It's okay.

290
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,669
They were old and full of holes.

291
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,338
And it worked out great.

292
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,091
I found some firecrackers

293
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,091
and a bag full of my baby teeth.

294
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,759
Thank you.

295
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,762
Oh. I also hung a cross

296
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,762
over the bed for you.

297
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,014
It's just Popsicle sticks

298
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,014
and glitter. I glued it together

299
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,724
in Sunday school

300
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,724
when I was a kid.

301
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,935
(crying softly)

302
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,478
Is-is it too much?

303
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,478
I can take it down.

304
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,440
(sniffles) No, it's...

305
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,984
it's really sweet. (sniffles)

306
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,947
(crying)

307
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,947
Why are you crying?

308
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,198
Did Georgie bring up

309
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,408
your unfortunate home life?

310
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,201
Uh, no.

311
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,786
Good. My mom said not to,

312
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,455
so that you

313
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,455
would be comfortable.

314
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,790
Thank you.

315
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,626
Are you comfortable?

316
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:26,714
(laughing) And I remember

317
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:26,714
how cute you looked

318
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,217
in your little pearl snap

319
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,217
shirt with your bolo tie.

320
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,888
Well, I'd say it wasn't

321
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,888
my first rodeo, but it was.

322
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,888
(both chuckling)

323
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,684
Thank you for

324
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,684
a wonderful year.

325
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:42,230
To many more.

326
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:42,230
To many more.

327
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,569
Which leads me

328
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,569
to the final surprise

329
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,280
of the evening.

330
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,785
What are you doing?

331
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,785
Hang on, I don't want

332
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,785
to spoil the surprise.

333
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,246
Getting down on one knee,

334
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,246
it makes it pretty damn clear.

335
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,915
Surprise!

336
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:09,257
Connie, will you

337
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:09,257
do me the honor

338
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,010
of being my wife?

339
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,179
Oh, John, I don't know.

340
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,891
How can you not know?

341
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,891
It's a binary decision.

342
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,352
It's more complicated

343
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,352
th-than that.

344
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,479
I don't see why.

345
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,479
We're compatible.

346
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,898
(quietly): I know.

347
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,898
We enjoy each other's company.

348
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:28,651
I know.

349
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:28,651
And we've become extremely

350
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:28,651
proficient in the bedroom.

351
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,529
There's very little

352
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,529
wasted effort.

353
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,946
(quietly):

354
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,946
John, sit back down

355
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,240
and lower your voice.

356
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,492
Little help?

357
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:39,037
Down is easier than up. (groans)

358
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:39,037
Sure.

359
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,999
MARY: Thank you, God, for this

360
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,999
food we're about to receive,

361
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,168
and for the nourishment

362
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,168
of our bodies, and bless

363
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,627
the hands that prepared it.

364
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,506
And an extra special thank-you

365
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,506
for allowing us

366
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,675
to share our home with

367
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,675
our friend Veronica.

368
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,344
ALL: Amen.

369
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,344
GEORGE JR.: Oh, yeah.

370
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,263
That's a big amen on that one.

371
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,014
MARY:

372
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,014
All right, everybody, dig in.

373
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,974
Would you like a dinner roll?

374
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,184
Mmm. Sure.

375
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,312
I find it really

376
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,312
rounds out the meal.

377
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,856
Mom?

378
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,856
Yes, honey?

379
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:10,151
Do I have to sit downwind

380
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:10,151
of Georgie's cologne?

381
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:13,029
So, Veronica, I understand

382
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:13,029
that you're a junior?

383
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,364
Mm. Yes, sir.

384
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,783
Do you have any plans

385
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,783
for after high school?

386
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,785
I'm hoping for a

387
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,785
scholarship to Baylor

388
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,203
so I can get

389
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,203
a teaching degree.

390
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,204
Mm.

391
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,956
I like kids. (chuckles)

392
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,375
Really? Kids? Ugh.

393
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,628
You're so tall and pretty,

394
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,628
you should be Vanna White.

395
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,171
How can she be Vanna White?

396
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,590
Vanna White is Vanna White.

397
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,633
Fine. She can be Vanna Blue.

398
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,469
See? This is the kind

399
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,469
of nonsense you have

400
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,304
to deal with when

401
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,304
you're around kids.

402
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,846
He does have a point.

403
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,391
No. I-I love this.

404
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,726
We never eat dinner

405
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,726
together at my house.

406
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,312
You eat alone?

407
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,316
Mostly. Yeah.

408
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,526
(quietly):

409
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,526
Lucky duck.

410
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,571
(indistinct chatter)

411
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:55,947
John...

412
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,532
I've already been

413
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,532
married once.

414
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,410
I wasn't really planning

415
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,410
on ever doing it again.

416
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,620
Why not?

417
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,498
I was somebody's wife

418
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,498
for a long time.

419
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:09,503
I just like being...

420
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:09,503
Connie Tucker now.

421
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,338
Not Mrs....

422
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,713
somebody else's name.

423
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,425
Well, what if I took your name?

424
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,178
John Tucker, it sounds great.

425
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,389
Like a football player

426
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,389
or an astronaut.

427
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,849
You're missing the point.

428
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,185
I just think it's important

429
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,185
for people to know

430
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,769
that we're an official couple.

431
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,855
We don't have to be married

432
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,855
for that.

433
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,690
Buy a billboard,

434
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,690
take an ad out in the paper.

435
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,070
I understand. Thank you.

436
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,074
Are we good?

437
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,160
Yes.

438
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,373
But if I should

439
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,373
pre-decease you...

440
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,001
(voice breaking):

441
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,001
I want you to have the ring.

442
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,045
Fine.

443
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,045
It'll be in the...

444
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,674
top right corner

445
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,674
of my dresser drawer.

446
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,759
Got it.

447
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,759
(crying):

448
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,759
Under my tube socks.

449
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,478
Veronica. Veronica.

450
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,104
VERONICA:

451
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,104
Come in.

452
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:12,857
Hey, Sheldon, what's up?

453
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,693
I printed out

454
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,693
my bathroom schedule.

455
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,611
I can't speak for anyone else

456
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,611
in this family,

457
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,446
but you can count on it

458
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,446
being occupied

459
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,698
during these times.

460
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,782
Thank you.

461
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,577
This is very helpful.

462
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,828
I know.

463
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,166
Is there anything else?

464
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,420
There is, but...

465
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,420
I'm not allowed to ask about it.

466
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,714
Oh, it's okay.

467
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,714
You can ask me anything.

468
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,756
Oh, good.

469
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,756
I don't like cats,

470
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,593
but I share

471
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,593
their curious nature.

472
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,595
(laughs)

473
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,595
What do you want to know?

474
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,513
Your mom has

475
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,513
a boyfriend.

476
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:44,723
Yeah.

477
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,099
Where is your father?

478
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,226
I don't know.

479
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,270
Why do you not know?

480
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,647
Well, he left

481
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,647
when I was really young

482
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,357
and I never

483
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,357
heard from him again.

484
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,150
And why are you staying here?

485
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,028
My mom's boyfriend

486
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,028
isn't very nice.

487
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,407
I understand.

488
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,407
My sister isn't very nice.

489
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,451
(chuckles) So you get it?

490
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,993
I do, thank you.

491
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,413
Okay, well,

492
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,413
talk to you later.

493
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,665
But not between

494
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,665
7:00 and 7:12.

495
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,501
Yup, I see it right here.

496
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,885
(drops keys)

497
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,638
So... how about

498
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,432
I make us a pot of tea

499
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,432
and we'll get cozy?

500
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,933
Sure, sounds good.

501
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,603
Just make yourself comfy,

502
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,603
I-I'll be right back.

503
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,400
Mint tea?

504
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,570
Or would you like to go crazy

505
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,570
and have a little hibiscus?

506
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,530
(door closes)

507
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,407
(water turns off)

508
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,415
Ah, damn it.

509
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,167
BOY (over TV): Buddy,

510
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,167
they let you out?

511
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,085
BUDDY: Yeah, but

512
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,085
they let Charles in.

513
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,129
Hey, can I join you?

514
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,547
Sure.

515
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,675
What you watching?

516
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,468
<i>Charles in Charge.</i>

517
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,637
It's kind of like<i> Who's</i>

518
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,637
<i>the Boss?</i> but with Chachi.

519
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,973
They should have called it

520
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,973
<i>Chachi in Charge.</i>

521
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,267
<i>Cha-Chi in Charge.</i>

522
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,977
That's three cha's. I like it.

523
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,312
(laughs)

524
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,482
Georgie, you're so funny.

525
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,983
Really?

526
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,568
Not everybody gets me.

527
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,279
I get you.

528
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,577
♪ ♪

529
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,873
Uh-oh.

530
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,961
Oh, Mom. If you're sleeping

531
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,961
with the man,

532
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,129
you should be married to him.

533
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,715
Why do I come here?

534
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,842
I got to find

535
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,842
a cooler chick to talk to.

536
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,093
You know I'm right.

537
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,345
I know no such thing.

538
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,638
It's my life,

539
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,638
I don't have to do

540
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,431
anything 'cause

541
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,431
I'm "supposed to."

542
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,266
I do it because I want to,

543
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,266
and right now,

544
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,934
I don't want to, end of story.

545
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,396
Good morning.

546
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,396
Can I get you

547
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,396
some breakfast, honey?

548
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,022
Yes, please.

549
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,900
How was your anniversary date

550
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,900
with Dr. Sturgis?

551
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,485
You knew about that?

552
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,112
Yes.

553
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,112
So you knew

554
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,112
he was gonna propose?

555
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,240
Propose? No, that's wonderful.

556
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,992
Although, it's a little

557
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,992
disconcerting he didn't tell me.

558
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,119
I thought we were

559
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,119
closer than that.

560
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,872
Well, we're not

561
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,872
getting married any time soon.

562
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,708
You should. You're old;

563
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,708
you don't have many years left.

564
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,294
I really need to meet

565
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,294
a whole new group of people.

566
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,216
Hey, what you doin'?

567
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,511
Helping your mom with laundry.

568
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,471
Oh, yeah. That's usually my job.

569
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,852
(TV playing indistinctly)

570
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,271
Uh, maybe when you're done,

571
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,271
we can go down to the mall

572
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,064
and hang out.

573
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,901
Oh, I promised your sister I'd

574
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,901
take her out for some girl time.

575
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,027
Maybe I can come along.

576
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,864
Then it wouldn't be girl time.

577
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,116
No, not entirely,

578
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,116
but it would be mostly.

579
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,326
Take a hint, dummy.

580
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,709
(phone ringing)

581
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,421
(machine beeps)

582
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,339
STURGIS (recorded):

583
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,339
Greetings.

584
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,592
You've reached Dr. John Sturgis.

585
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,010
Leave a message

586
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,010
and I'll be in touch.

587
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,387
Thank you very much.

588
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,389
Hey, that rhymed.

589
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,766
(machine beeps)

590
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,766
(chuckles)

591
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:18,269
John, I know

592
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:18,269
you're there, pick up.

593
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,775
If you don't pick up,

594
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,775
I'm gonna get really mad.

595
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,322
I'm getting really mad.

596
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,078
Call me back.

Sorry, I know this isn't

601
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:57,266
the most fun thing in the world.

602
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,810
I was happy just riding

603
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,770
in the front seat

604
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,770
of your car.

00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,567
princess pretty.

610

Oh. I don't know

Well, until I'm allowed

615
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,825
to wear makeup,

616
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,159
this is as hot as I get.

617
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,537
You don't need makeup.

618
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,498
I hope you're right. Mom says

619
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,498
I have to wait till I'm 16.

620
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,542
Mm. That'll get here

621
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,542
sooner than you think.

622
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,085
Sure doesn't feel like it.

623
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,965
Don't be in a rush.

624
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,550
Honestly...

625
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,302
I'd rather be

626
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,302
your age again.

627
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,302
Really?

628
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,804
Yeah.

629
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,890
Being a grown-up is, uh...

630
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,641
complicated.

631
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:41,185
Maybe, if we make

632
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:41,185
a wish at the same time

633
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,520
we could switch places.

634
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,689
You think?

635
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,689
It's worth a try.

636
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,233
Okay.

637
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,735
What do we need to do?

We close our eyes

639
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,362
and at the exact same time say,

640
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,364
"I wish I could switch places."

641
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,949

198
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,971
But I can give you

199
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,971
this in the meantime.

200
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,724
<i>Anyone Can Play Violin.</i>

201
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,977
They don't set the

202
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,977
bar very high.

203
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,273
MEEMAW:

204
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,273
<i>You know what you need to do?</i>

205
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,774
MARY:

206
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,774
<i>Yes.</i>

207
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,444
How's it going?

208
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,072
MARY:

209
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,072
It'd be a lot easier to pee

210
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,072
if you'd stop talking.

211
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,949
Sorry.

212
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,244
(exhales)

213
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,537
Now it's too quiet.

214
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,537
Say something.

215
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,792
I know you didn't expect this,

216
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,711
and you still might not be,

217
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,711
but...

218
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,048
but if it turns out you are...

219
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,509
I'm here for you.

220
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,928
Thanks, Mom.

221
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,928
(toilet flushes)

222
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,346
You're not the one

223
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,346
I'm worried about.

224
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,017
If I'm pregnant,

225
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,017
George is gonna flip out.

226
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,477
I'm sure he would at first.

227
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,688
Then he would

228
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,688
calm down.

229
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:58,692
Take a few beers.

230
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,319
Maybe some malt liquor.

231
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,863
I suppose.

232
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,283
(sighs) The truth is,

233
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,283
he and I were both

234
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,118
freaked out

235
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,118
about having twins.

236
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,996
But now I can't imagine

237
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,996
life without them.

238
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,956
Well, see,

239
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,956
there you are.

240
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:16,918
So, no matter what

241
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:16,918
that test says,

242
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,879
you're gonna be okay.

243
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,088
You're right.

244
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,549
What's it say?

245
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,675
(sighs)

246
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,594
I'm gonna go

247
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,594
buy that malt liquor.

248
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,976
To get started,

249
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,976
place your violin

250
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,520
in rest position.

251
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,520
Your feet should be together.

252
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,772
Your right arm

253
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,772
should be

254
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,191
over your instrument,

255
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,776
not touching the strings

256
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,776
or the bridge.

257
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,654
Put your left hand...

258
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,654
What are you doing?

259
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,365
What does it look like?

260
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,326
Like you're looking for another

261
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,326
excuse for kids to pick on you.

262
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,703
Now, you are ready

263
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,703
to position your feet.

264
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,164
Zip your feet open

265
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,164
and step forward

266
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,750
with your left foot.

267
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,335
Your feet should...

268
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,335
What are<i> you</i> doing?

269
00:06:58,377 --> 00:06:59,753
I was gonna watch<i> DuckTales,</i>

270
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,629
but this looks funnier.

271
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,882
...procedure for positioning

272
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,882
the violin on your shoulder.

273
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,551
Hold your violin

274
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,551
above the left foot

275
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,845
with the neck

276
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,845
of the instrument pointing up.

277
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,638
Left foot, neck up.

278
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,599
Now rotate the neck

279
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,599
of the instrument

280
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,269
counterclockwise,

281
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,269
so that the neck points

282
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,937
at your left foot.

283
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,940
Oh, boy.

284
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,940
I was right.

285
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,816
Bend your left elbow

286
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,816
so that the violin

287
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,610
rests on your shoulder

288
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,695
and place your head

289
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,695
on the chin rest.

290
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,698
Now try dropping your left hand.

291
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,200
See if you can

292
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,200
hold your instrument

293
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,119
without your hands.

294
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,204
Time yourself at this...

295
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,204
What's going on?

296
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:37,040
(mumbles):

297
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:37,040
I'm learning to play the violin.

298
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,875
It's my new favorite show.

299
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,295
Once you feel you have control

300
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,295
of your instrument,

301
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:44,047
try moving your hands around.

302
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,472
(laughing)

303
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,099
Repeat this procedure

304
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,099
until you can position

305
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,185
your instrument

306
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,185
comfortably and quickly.

307
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,025
He'll just be

308
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,025
another minute.

309
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,235
Thank you.

310
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,491
What's that about?

311
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,491
Oh...

312
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,328
just trying not

313
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,328
to breathe the smoke in.

314
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,037
(chuckles)

315
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,037
Come on.

316
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,498
It already went through

317
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,498
the filter and my lungs.

318
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,875
This stuff is squeaky clean.

319
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,875
(coughs)

320
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,627
Well, still.

321
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,256
He's all yours,

322
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,256
your highness.

323
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:27,882
(muffled):

324
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:27,882
All right.

325
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,968
(coughs)

326
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,471
Hey, Mare, what's up?

327
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,471
Other than the big guy. (laughs)

328
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,097
God joke.

329
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:38,726
Actually, um,

330
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:38,726
I could use some guidance.

331
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,102
I got some news today,

332
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,063
and I'm not quite sure

333
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,063
how I feel about it.

334
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,442
Of course. Sit.

335
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,532
Well... I am...

336
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,534
um...

337
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,036
with child.

338
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,496
That's wonderful!

339
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,041
Congratulations!

340
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,041
How far along are you?

341
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,084
Uh, could you keep it down

342
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,084
just a little?

343
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,544
I haven't exactly

344
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,544
told George yet.

345
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,754
Got it. And why not?

346
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,215
It is his, right?

347
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,841
Of course.

348
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,551
Apologies.

349
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,428
Hey, I'm a pastor

350
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,428
in a small town.

351
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,224
You wouldn't believe

352
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,224
the juicy things I hear.

353
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,436
This just wasn't

354
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,436
part of our plan.

355
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,147
Well, luckily...

356
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,147
it's part of God's plan.

357
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,233
And let me tell you

358
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,233
about another Mary

359
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,985
who didn't know how to tell

360
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,985
her husband she was expecting.

361
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:32,239
And her story is way weirder

362
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:32,239
than yours. (chuckles)

363
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,285
In order to practice this,

364
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,285
move your bow

365
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,539
in a counterclockwise direction.

366
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,084
Keep your hand moving right

367
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,084
with the tip of the bow.

368
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,210
For our next song,

369
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,920
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,"

370
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,964
remember, posture

371
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,964
is our most important thing.

372
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,425
Set, play.

373
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,552
(violin screeching)

374
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,145
(violin playing over TV)

375
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,273
Did you hear that?

376
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,273
I did it!

377
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,774
I don't think you did.

378
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:11,819
And now we see how

379
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:11,819
it helps my science.

380
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,155
Hmm.

381
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,158
Hmm...

382
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,287
(groans)

383
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,539
Come on, think.

384
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,501
Probably needs more

385
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,501
"Twinkle, Twinkle."

386
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,002
INSTRUCTOR: ...for

387
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,002
learning new songs.

388
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,837
You can play them

389
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,837
along with me.

390
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,590
(violin screeching)

391
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,219
<i>(screeching continues)</i>

392
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,432
What the hell is that?

393
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,477
Sheldon's learning

394
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,477
to play the violin.

395
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,812
Oh. Well, that's

396
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,812
unfortunate.

397
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,021
Mm-hmm.

398
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,190
I'm gonna go change.

399
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,614
Hey, Dad. Can you believe

400
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,614
I only started playing today?

401
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,865
I really can.

402
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,577
(screeching continues)

403
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,630
Hey, so there's something

404
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,548
I've been meaning

405
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,548
to talk to you about.

406
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,715
Sure, what's up?

407
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:18,386
Now, before I say it, um,

408
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,473
I want to tell you a story

409
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,473
of another Mary.

410
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,224
Um...

411
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,224
(clears throat)

412
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,809
Okay, anytime...

413
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,354
GEORGE SR.:

414
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,354
Are you kidding me?

415
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,938
Keep your voice down.

416
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,024
(whispers):

417
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,024
Are you kidding me?

418
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,109
Look, I was a little thrown,

419
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,109
too, but Pastor Jeff said...

420
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,861
Pastor Jeff?

421
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,613
Pastor Jeff knows before me?

422
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:39,407
Well, yeah, I needed

423
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:39,407
someone to talk to,

424
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,326
and, you know, my mom...

425
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,326
Your mom?

426
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,787
Shh!

427
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,787
Does the whole damn town know?

428
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,914
No. Just my mom and Pastor Jeff.

429
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,251
And maybe Brenda Sparks.

430
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,796
Probably Peg...

431
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,757
and whoever she told,

432
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,757
but that is it.

433
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,092
Oh, is that it?

434
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,594
(knocking on door)

435
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,594
SHELDON: Great news!

436
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,346
Not a good time,

437
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,346
Sheldon.

438
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,056
(knocking on door)

439
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,056
SHELDON: But it's

440
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,056
really important.

441
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,599
Ugh.

442
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:09,646
I figured out why the violin

443
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:09,646
worked for Einstein

444
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:11,189
and not for me.

445
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,650
I need to become

446
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,650
a Jewish person.

447
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,449
MARY:<i> Sheldon, dinner!</i>

448
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,449
SHELDON:<i> Coming.</i>

449
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,787
Sorry I'm late.

450
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,787
Shalom.

451
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:29,957
(sighs)

452
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,251
What's on your head?

453
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,045
A yarmulke.

454
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,045
A yama-what?

455
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,838
It's a special Jewish hat.

456
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,299
It reminds the wearer

457
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,299
that God is always over you.

458
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,676
(laughing)

459
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,094
Mom.

460
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,845
Oh, come on, it's funny.

461
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,639
It's not funny

462
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,639
and it's not a yarmulke.

463
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:48,393
It is a coaster I crocheted

464
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:48,393
at Bible camp.

465
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,270
Are you gonna say

466
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,270
something to him?

467
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,398
Normally I would, but I got

468
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,398
bigger problems right now.

469
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,860
Let's just say grace.

470
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,860
SHELDON: Hold on.

471
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,987
Are these

472
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,987
hot dogs kosher?

473
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,948
(laughing, snorts)

474
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,368
<i>(violin screeching)</i>

<i>She doesn't live with us.</i>

488
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,348
Hey, George.

489
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,100
Hey, Herschel.

490
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,685
Let me guess,

491
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,685
you're here to complain

492
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,646
about Sheldon's violin playing.

493
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,355
Under normal circumstances,

494
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,355
I'd say yeah,

495
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,107
but since he started,

496
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,110
my chickens been

497
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,110
dropping eggs like crazy.

498
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,655
That's weird.

499
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,655
Hey, uh,

500
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,157
I hear congratulations

501
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,157
are in order.

502
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,617
What's that you hear?

503
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,952
Maybe I didn't hear it.

504
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,952
Never mind.

505
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,078
It's all right.

506
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,456
Seems like everybody knows.

507
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,000
You don't seem

508
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,000
terribly enthusiastic.

509
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,418
(sighs)

510
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,295
It's the money, Herschel.

511
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,879
It's all about the money.

512
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,216
(sighs) Well, there's only one

513
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,216
solution to that.

514
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,303
Which is?

515
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,303
You got to make more money.

516
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,263
Thank you.

517
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,263
Welcome.

518
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,224
Hey, I got to ask,

519
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,224
did that fiddle playing

520
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,435
increase the fertility

00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:15,438

523
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:15,438
my chickens? (chuckles)

524
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,024
I was just throwing it

525
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,024
out there, never mind.

526
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,360
Wait here, I'm-a go

527
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,360
get you some eggs.

528
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,154
That's okay.

529
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,154
You're getting eggs.

530
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,406
Guess I'm getting eggs.

531
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,450
PETERSEN:

00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,450
<i>All right, George,</i>

533
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,870

534
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,870
Well...

535
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,414

the why's and wherefore's,

537
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,125
but I'm gonna

538
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,125
need a raise.

539
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,794
Is this 'cause Mary's pregnant?

540
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,920
You got to be kidding me.

541
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,256
Does everybody in this damn town

542
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,256
know my business?

543
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,133
I just-- it was taking a guess.

00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,553
Tom.

545
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,553
My wife told me.

546
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,930
Doesn't matter. What do you say?

547
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,266
Are you threatening to quit

548
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,266
if you don't get it?

549
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,102
No, Tom, I'm threatening

550
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,102
to rob a bank.

551
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,102
Okay.

552
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,063
All right, well,

553
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,063
let's not do that.

554
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,650
$100 a week do the trick?

555
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,862
Yes. Thanks. Bye.

Hello, I'd like

561
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,288
to become Jewish.

563
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,375
How old are you?

00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,960

Um, how can I help you?

573
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:38,813
I'm currently a Baptist and

574
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:38,813
I'd like to convert to Judaism.

575

Okay.

577
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,361
And why do you want to convert?

578
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:48,615
Very simple. It's my intention

579
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:48,615
to become a great scientist

580
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,033
and I couldn't help but notice

581
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,033
most of the great scientists

582
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:55,329
are Jewish, so logic dictates

583
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:55,329
it's time to switch teams.

584
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,997
Well, I'm sure there are

585
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,584
many Baptist scientists

586
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,584
you could emulate.

587
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,502
That's kind of you to say,

588
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,046
but other than Cornelis Drebbel

589
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,046
in the 1500s,

590
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,548
it's pretty slim pickings.

591
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,216
(chuckles)

592
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,052
Well, Sheldon, you sound like

593
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,052
a very smart young man.

594
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,805
Oh, you have no idea.

595
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:14,599
Can I ask how your parents

596
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:14,599
feel about this?

597
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,059
Well, when I presented them

598
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,059
with my plan,

599
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,228
the words "over my dead body"

600
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,228
were used.

601
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,229
(Rabbi chuckles)

602
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,398
I'm not surprised.

603
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,400
But they were

604
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,400
similarly resistant

605
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,068
when I wanted to get an ant farm

606
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,695
and eventually they came around.

607
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:31,866
All right, here's what

608
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:31,866
I'm gonna tell you to do.

609
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,326
Read your Bible.

610
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,161
Already did, cover to cover.

611
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,163
Really?

612
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,163
Quiz me.

613
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,458
No, that's okay, I believe you.

614
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,628
All right, my advice to you

615
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,798
is to stay with the faith

616
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,798
of your parents.

617
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,300
What else you got?

618
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,300
Okay.

619
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,678
Then I'm gonna tell you

620
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,554
to be your own man.

621
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,766
But I want to be a great

622
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,766
scientist like Albert Einstein.

623
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:57,934
Sheldon,

624
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,186
when your days are over,

625
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,981
God will never ask you,

626
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,483
"Why weren't you Einstein?"

627
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,487
But he might ask you,

628
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,031
"Why weren't you Sheldon?"

629
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,829
(door opens)

630
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,333
What's going on? You all right?

631
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,545
I'm not feeling great.

632
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,005
Is it a pregnant thing?

633
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,840
'Cause I got

634
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,840
some good news on that.

635
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,467
I got a decent raise.

636
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,093
It doesn't matter.

637
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,637
What do you mean

638
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,637
it doesn't matter?

639
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,514
We can pull this off now.

640
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,059
I lost the baby.

641
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,690
Oh.

642
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,158
(sighs)

643
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,536
You're probably relieved, huh?

644
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,455
Actually...

645
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,877
...no.

646
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,009
I love the first three.

647
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,386
Fourth one's a charm, right?

648
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,642
(knocking on door)

649
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,642
SHELDON: Dad?

650
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,978
(knocking on door)

651
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,978
SHELDON: Mom?

652
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,980
(sighs)

653
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,148
Yeah, Shelly? (clears throat)

654
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,148
(door opens)

655
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,485
I just thought you should know

656
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,485
I'm not going to be Jewish.

657
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:35,406
I'm going to remain the atheist

658
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:35,406
Baptist you've come to love.

659
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:39,368
Good to hear.

660
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,161
Are you crying?

661
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,330
(sighs)

662
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,500
Yeah, but don't worry,

663
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,500
everything's okay.

664
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,129
Good.

665
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,301
(exhales)

666
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,304
ADULT SHELDON:<i> Once again,</i>

667
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,304
<i>I brought my mother so much joy</i>

668
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:01,933
<i>she was moved to tears.</i>

669
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:01,933
<i>I don't know how I do it.</i>

670
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,021
(intercom beeps)

671
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,606
RECEPTIONIST: Tom,

672
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,606
George Cooper's here for you.

673
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,190
Send him in.

674
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,568
Hey, Tom, you got a minute?

675
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,570
Pretty busy.

676
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,238
Make it quick.

677
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,575
It turns out I don't

678
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,575
need that raise.

679
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,368
What happened,

680
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,368
you win the lottery?

681
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,579
No, no.

682
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,754
Aw, George, I am so sorry.

683
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,590
Well, what can you do?

684
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,426
Listen, I cleared

685
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,426
your raise already,

686
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,928
why don't you just

687
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,928
keep the money.

688
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,055
Oh, no, I couldn't do that.

689
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,055
No.

690
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,100
No, I mean it. It's yours.

691
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,311
Okay.

692
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,938
Thanks. Bye.

693
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,485
Thank you, but I will

694
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,485
no longer be needing these.

695
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,779
You're giving up

696
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,779
so soon?

697
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,448
What happened?

698
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,448
Did it hurt your fingers?

699
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,448
No.

700
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,451
I'm following the advice of

701
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,451
a very wise Rabbi Schneiderman

702
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,244
from Temple Judea in Houston.

703
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,206
Is this another one

704
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,206
of your jokes?

705
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,667
No. If it were a joke,

706
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,667
your mouth would be open

707
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:13,087
and the sound "ha-ha"

708
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:13,087
would be coming out.

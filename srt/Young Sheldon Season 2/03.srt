1
00:00:01,627 --> 00:00:05,464
"That everyone who believes

2
00:00:01,627 --> 00:00:05,464
may have eternal life in him.

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:11,219
For God so loved the world that

4
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:11,219
he gave his one and only son."

5
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,012
(whispers):

6
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,012
Here we go.

7
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,516
(sighs) Yes, Sheldon?

8
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,893
When you said God gave

9
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,893
his son to the world,

10
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,854
did you mean Earth

11
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,854
or the universe?

12
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:22,105
Earth.

13
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,732
But if God created the universe,

14
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,526
wouldn't he want

15
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,526
to save all of it?

16
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,653
Yes, uh, he would.

17
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:28,904
Then why did you say Earth?

18
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:32,533
"Earth" is a synonym

19
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:32,533
for the universe.

20
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:35,285
(quietly): He's

21
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:35,285
grabbing at straws now.

22
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,412
So if God's plan is

23
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,412
to save all of the universe,

24
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,123
that means a race of

25
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,123
octopus aliens light-years away

26
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,210
could only be saved by Jesus?

27
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,210
Sure.

28
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,963
Even though they never

29
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,963
would've heard of him?

30
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,963
Yes.

31
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:48,298
Even though his appearance

32
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:48,298
might be terrifying to them?

33
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,258
W-Why would his appearance

34
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,258
be terrifying?

35
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,844
He has four limbs

36
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,844
and they have eight.

37
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,888
Okay, that's enough.

38
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,888
JEFF: No, no.

39
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,015
I prayed people would be

40
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,015
more interested in my sermons.

41
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,266
I suppose I should've been

42
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,266
more specific.

43
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,519
Sheldon, if

44
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,519
these creatures

45
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:04,313
were born without sin, they

46
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:04,313
don't need to be saved by Jesus.

47
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,943
What if an octopus Adam and Eve

48
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,943
brought sin to their world?

49
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:11,613
Would they be saved by a human

50
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:11,613
Jesus or an octopus Jesus?

51
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,490
(sighs)

52
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,701
(laughs)

00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:18,704

And then I said octopus aliens

60
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:36,095
didn't need to become Christian

61
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,390
because they're not affected

62
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,390
by original sin.

63
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,936
You should've been there; Pastor

64
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,936
Jeff almost started crying.

65
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,562
Oh, now I'm sorry

66
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,562
I missed it.

67
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,689
That's your fault

68
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,689
for having a hangover.

69
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,608
Or it's God's fault for

70
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,608
putting Sunday morning

71
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,276
after Saturday night.

72
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,862
(phone ringing)

73
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,989
Meemaw, could you take me

74
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,989
to Radio Shack?

75
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,989
MARY: Hello?

76
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,365
Sure, maybe later.

77
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:56,533
Later's a little vague.

78
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,077
Could you please

79
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,077
be more specific?

80
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,495
When I'm good and ready.

81
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,495
How's that?

82
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,373
Better, but I'd really

83
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,373
like to nail this down.

84
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,960
Why don't you ask

85
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,960
your father to take you?

86
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,544
Dad?

87
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,544
What?

88
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,338
Can you please

89
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,338
take me to Radio Shack?

90
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,007
I'm busy.

91
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,007
Ask your meemaw.

92
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,801
I did.

93
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,801
She said to ask you.

94
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,094
Well, ask her again.

95
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,345
Seems counterintuitive,

96
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,345
but all right.

97
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,639
Meemaw?

98
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,015
Oh, Lord.

99
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,642
Everything okay?

100
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,478
No.

101
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,314
Stephanie Hanson's daughter was

102
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,314
in a car accident last night.

103
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,398
She died.

104
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,317
Oh, no.

105
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,444
My God.

106
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,822
She was barely 16.

107
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,657
GEORGE SR.:

108
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,657
That's horrible.

109
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,159
Is there anything we can do?

110
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,786
I don't know.

111
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,203
Um... ugh.

112
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,123
I need to call

113
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,123
folks at the church.

114
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,541
(Mary sighs)

115
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,252
Any more thoughts

116
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,252
on Radio Shack?

117
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,964
Sheldon, do you

118
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,964
really think

119
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:55,300
this is the appropriate

120
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:55,300
time to ask that question?

121
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,553
I did, but now

122
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,553
I'm second-guessing myself.

123
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,690
How you holding up?

124
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,400
I'm okay.

125
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,028
(clears throat)

126
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:17,948
16 years old.

127
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,908
It's just awful.

128
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,495
It's all part of God's plan.

129
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,295
(TV playing quietly)

130
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,256
How come we don't get

131
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,256
to go to the funeral?

132
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,301
Why would you want

133
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,301
to go to a funeral?

134
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,303
I've never been to one.

135
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,263
When you get to be my age,

136
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,263
you get to go to plenty.

137
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,474
That's, like,

138
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,474
a hundred years from now.

139
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,519
You make it hard to love you.

140
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,064
Do you really see a dead body?

141
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,523
Sometimes.

142
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,274
How close do

143
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,274
you get to it?

144
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,111
Real close, if you want.

145
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,529
And the clothes they're wearing,

146
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,698
is that the clothes

147
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,698
they become a ghost in?

148
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,324
Depends. In the movie<i> Ghost,</i>

149
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,078
Patrick Swayze has on

150
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,078
the outfit that he dies in.

151
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,496
Casper runs around butt naked.

152
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,373
Maybe he died naked.

153
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,418
That's fun to think about.

154
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,462
And y'all wonder why

155
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,462
you're not at the funeral.

156
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,887
Good morning, Peg.

157
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,974
Well, it will be once this cup

158
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,974
of Sanka works its magic.

159
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,226
Is Pastor available?

160
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,394
Oh, he's on the phone

161
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,394
with his wife.

162
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,896
Oh, should I come back?

163
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,896
Nah.

164
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,565
He usually gets his groveling

165
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,565
done pretty quick.

166
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:40,321
So... that little Hanson girl,

167
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:40,321
that was horrible, huh?

168
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,323
Yeah.

169
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,535
Reminds you that...

170
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,204
life is precious.

171
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:49,456
(coughing loudly)

172
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,087
You're up, slugger.

173
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,797
(coughing continues)

174
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,925
JEFF: Come in.

175
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,925
(whoops)

176
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:03,595
I have the clothing drive flyers

177
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:03,595
if you'd like to take a look.

178
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,388
Thank you.

179
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,558
You all right, Mare?

180
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,227
(sighs)

181
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,857
No, not really.

182
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,320
Um... I can't stop thinking

183
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,320
about that little girl.

184
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,823
I understand.

185
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,908
That's why it's important

186
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,908
in these times

187
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,119
to take comfort in our faith.

188
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,791
What if that's

189
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,791
not doing the trick?

190
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,128
Events like this can

191
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,128
certainly create doubt.

192
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,006
It happens to me more often

193
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,006
than I'd like to admit.

194
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,259
What do you do?

195
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:48,182
I roll up my sleeves and I work

196
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:48,182
even harder at serving our Lord.

197
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:51,018
Mary, we each have

198
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:51,018
a relationship with God,

199
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,769
and relationships

200
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,769
take work.

201
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:53,979
Get out there.

202
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,940
Help the needy,

203
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,940
start a Bible study,

204
00:05:56,982 --> 00:06:00,359
hug a stranger and tell 'em

205
00:05:56,982 --> 00:06:00,359
the Lord loves 'em. (chuckles)

206
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:04,489
But not a child;

207
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:04,489
that backfires on you, big-time.

208
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,201
Thank you, Pastor Jeff.

209
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,952
You are most welcome.

210
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,830
Oh, and tell Sheldon

211
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,041
I spoke to

212
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,041
my seminary professor,

213
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,750
and the official ruling is:

214
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,712
God would appear to the octopus

215
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,712
aliens in octopus alien form

216
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,672
and save their

217
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,672
eight-legged souls.

218
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,049
Praise Jesus!

219
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,510
(chuckles)

220
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,095
(Peg coughing)

221
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,222
(door closes)

222
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,849
I should put that in a sermon.

223
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,273
Hold on, hold on.

224
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,273
Thank you, God,

225
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,399
for this food we are about to

226
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,399
receive and for the nourishment

227
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,820
of our bodies, and bless the

228
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,820
hands that prepared it. Amen.

229
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:47,032
We're doing this

230
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:47,032
at breakfast now?

231
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,407
Yes, I think it's a nice idea.

232
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,035
She's eating Count Chocula.

233
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,037
Doesn't he play

234
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,037
for the other side?

235
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,873
I'm so glad God blessed you

236
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,873
with a sense of humor, George.

237
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,627
Mom, have you received any

238
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,627
distressing phone calls today?

239
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,921
No. Why?

240
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,381
Just wondering if

241
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,381
it's an appropriate time

242
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,465
to ask if you could take me

243
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,465
to Radio Shack.

244
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,927
Sorry, sweetheart,

245
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,927
I can't today.

246
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,012
I have to bring this food

247
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,012
over to the Hanson family.

248
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,555
Then I have my new prayer group.

249
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,182
And after that,

250
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,182
I'm gonna get started

251
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:14,351
on a faith garden

252
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:14,351
in the backyard.

253
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,436
A faith garden?

254
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,436
What the hell is that?

255
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,355
Language.

256
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,357
It's an outdoorsy place

257
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,357
for me to speak to God.

258
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,110
Don't you already

259
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,110
speak to him indoorsy?

260
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,569
Yes, but in the backyard,

261
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,654
I can enjoy the beautiful world

262
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,654
he gave us.

263
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,490
You can also smell the

264
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,490
Sparks' chicken coop.

265
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,118
Well, I think it sounds nice.

266
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,786
Thank you. I'm gonna

267
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,786
need your truck

268
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,871
to get all the dirt and

269
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,871
flowers and tools that I need.

270
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,915
Sure.

271
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,915
Oh, oh, almost forgot.

272
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,376
Can you keep an eye out

273
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,376
for a rock big enough

274
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,086
to paint a Psalm on?

275
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,670
I can do that.

276
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,671
Wish me luck!

277
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,839
Luck!

278
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,550
Mm-hmm! (chuckles)

279
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,010
Is Mom okay?

280
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,553
How the heck should I know?

281
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,931
She left. You can say "hell."

282
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,356
MARY: ...our hearts

283
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,356
and stir us to action.

284
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,983
ADULT SHELDON:

285
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,983

GROUP:

291
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,324
Amen!

292
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,950

302
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,878
Mm-hmm.

303
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,213
Gently!

304
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,216
(panting):

305
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,216
Honey, it's a rock.

306
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,550

Georgie, you've heard us

347
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,976
talking to Sheldon

348
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,771
about asking questions at

349
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,771
inappropriate times, right?

350
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,231
Yeah, so?

351
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,857
So, given what's

352
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,857
happened this week,

353
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,317
do you think

354
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,317
it's an appropriate time

355
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,485
to be talking about driving?

356
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,530
Why? 'Cause that girl died?

357
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:16,491
(sighs)

358
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:16,491
Yes, that.

359
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,035
For your information,

360
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,035
I'd be an excellent driver.

361
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,205
(chuckles): I wouldn't trust you

362
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,205
to push a shopping cart.

363
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,082
Would you feel more

364
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,082
confident if I told you

365
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,750
I already know

366
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,750
how to drive?

367
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,503
Video games don't count.

368
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,503
I'll have you know

369
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,255
I've driven Meemaw's car.

370
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,592
I also drove your truck one

371
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,592
night while you were sleeping.

372
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,303
Are you crazy?!

373
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,888
I parked it and everything,

374
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,888
you had no idea.

375
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,601
Okay, let...

376
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,311
let me get this straight--

377
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,687
you're trying to prove to me

378
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,687
that you're a responsible person

379
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,815
by admitting you stole my truck.

380
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:52,611
I said I was responsible,

381
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:52,611
never said I was smart.

382
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,364
<i>(knocking at door)</i>

383
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,241
Hey.

384
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,076
Let's go out.

385
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,537
Go out where?

386
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,537
I don't know,

387
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:06,124
Dairy Queen, shooting range,

388
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:06,124
line dancing?

389
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,335
Have you been drinking?

390
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,712
I might've had a wine cooler

391
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,712
or two. (laughs)

392
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,382
Sweetheart, that ain't drinking.

393
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,802
♪ ♪

394
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,603
The bartender

395
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,603
asked to see my I.D.

396
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,438
Honey, he does that to get tips.

397
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,898
He asked me for mine, too.

398
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,818
Well, I like to think we're both

399
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,818
young attractive ladies.

400
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,694
(laughs):

401
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,694
To that old fart? Yeah.

402
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,114
(both chuckle)

403
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,867
Mmm.

404
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,867
Whoa.

405
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,494
Whoa, pace yourself, cowgirl.

406
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,496
I'm fine.

407
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,289
Are we gonna shoot pool

408
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,289
or not?

409
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,832
You bet.

410
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,379
Hmm!

411
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,297
Did you know George and I

412
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,297
used to come here

413
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,714
when we first started dating?

414
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,133
Is that so?

415
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,801
He kissed me right over there

416
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,801
in that booth.

417
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,680
Why, was there some

418
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,680
barbecue sauce on your face?

419
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,764
It's a fat joke.

420
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,725
I got it, Mom.

421
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,725
(pool balls scatter)

422
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:10,063
Come on.

423
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:10,063
Come on.

424
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,649
Why are you putting us to bed?

425
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,859
'Cause your mother's out.

426
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,859
Where is she?

427
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:15,985
She's with your

428
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:15,985
grandmother.

429
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,487
Where'd they go?

430
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,487
I don't know.

431
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,906
Why don't you know?

432
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,906
Because I'm here with you!

433
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,534
(clears throat)

434
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,244
Good night. Sweet dreams.

435
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,870
Mom gives us kisses.

436
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,000
Fine.

437
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,922
Mm, your beard is scratchy.

438
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,090
Too bad. Sheldon?

439
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,799
I respectfully pass.

440
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,554
Mom also does

441
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,554
the good night dance.

442
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,434
Now you're just screwing

443
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,434
with me.

444
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,103
Night.

445
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,106
You should've gone with

446
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,106
"sings us a lullaby."

447
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,567
Yeah, I got cocky.

448
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:59,404
Slow down there, sister,

449
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:59,404
you got church in the morning.

450
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,197
Who says I'm going?

451
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:04,743
What is happening with you?

452
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:07,954
Do you really want to know?

453
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:17,088
So, the other day

454
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:17,088
I was making a casserole

455
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,132
to bring over to the Hansons,

456
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,968
and I wanted to include

457
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,968
a sympathy card.

458
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,846
So I started to write,

459
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,933
"Your daughter's

460
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,933
in a better place."

461
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,772
(voice breaking):

462
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,772
And I had to stop.

463
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:44,407
Because how could that

464
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:44,407
possibly be true?

465
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,701
How could a better place

466
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,701
be anywhere

467
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:50,288
than at home safe

468
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:50,288
with her family?

469
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,874
She was just a little kid.

470
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,461
That could've...

471
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,631
been Georgie behind the wheel.

472
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:09,390
How could that possibly

473
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:09,390
be God's plan?

474
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,395
Looks like you could use

475
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,395
a shoulder to cry on.

476
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,063
(sighs)

477
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,108
No, she does not need

478
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,108
a shoulder to cry on,

479
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,153
but I do need a place to

480
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,153
store my pool stick.

481
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,989
Maybe I'd like that.

482
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,989
(laughs)

483
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,492
Get.

484
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,954
<i>(knocking at door)</i>

485
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,333
What the hell?

486
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,085
Your problem now.

487
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,671
Ooh.

488
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,671
Watch it.

489
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:40,880
Here.

490
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:40,880
(clears throat)

491
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,089
What am I supposed to do

492
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,089
with her?

493
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,883
I don't know.

494
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,883
But be careful.

495
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,134
Last time she was this drunk,

496
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,720
you ended up with

497
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,720
your first son.

498
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,222
Night.

499
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,350
He's not that fat, Mom!

500
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,693
Now you're cooking breakfast

501
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,693
for us?

502
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,027
Your mom's not

503
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,027
feeling well.

504
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,779
Is she contagious?

505
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,779
No.

506
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,113
Just tired.

507
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,241
Did you check her for ticks?

508
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,159
Soon as she wakes up.

509
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,661
You can check her

510
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,661
while she's asleep.

511
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:12,787
Sit down!

512
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,751
Do you even know how to cook?

513
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:21,087
Believe it or not, I am capable

514
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:21,087
of making breakfast.

515
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,840
Sorry. It's not like we see you

516
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,840
do much around here.

517
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:26,133
How 'bout,

518
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:26,133
"Thanks for cooking, Dad"?

519
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,637
Chocolate chips?

520
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,637
Thanks for cooking, Dad.

521
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,599
Is Mom going to church?

522
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,642
I don't think she's up to it.

523
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,437
But she never misses church.

524
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,694
Are you feeling better?

525
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,738
Yes, baby, I'm fine.

526
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,741
GEORGE SR.:

527
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,741
All right, here we go.

528
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,201
Chocolate chips for breakfast

529
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,201
and pizza for dinner?

530
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,536
I'm loving Dad.

531
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,414
Where were you last night?

532
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,958
Out with your grandmother.

533
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,958
But where'd you go?

534
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,960
Enough questions.

535
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,960
Y'all ask me questions

536
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,670
when I come home late.

537
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,548
Oh, I can explain that-- you're

538
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,548
an idiot and we don't trust you.

539
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,217
(sighs)

540
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,219
Mom, you didn't say grace.

541
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:13,514
Don't worry about it.

542
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,893
Come on, y'all.

543
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,648
(sighs)

544
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,276
Can I sit with you?

545
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:29,029
I think Mommy needs to

546
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:29,029
be alone right now.

547
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,198
All right.

548
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,123
(sighs)

549
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,584
Mom, I'm scared.

550
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:42,961
Why?

551
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,253
You didn't go to church,

552
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,839
you stopped saying grace.

553
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,215
I don't understand

554
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,215
what's going on.

555
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,218
(sighs)

556
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,053
It's kind of hard to explain.

557
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,723
Is it me?

558
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,183
Did I do something wrong?

559
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,018
Of course not.

560
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,770
(pats seat)

561
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,770
Come here.

562
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:04,064
(sighs)

563
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:08,486
Sheldon... (sighs)

564
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,738
faith means believing

565
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,738
in something

566
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,450
you can't know

567
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,450
for sure is real.

568
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,536
(sighs)

569
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:20,999
And right now,

570
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:20,999
I am struggling with that.

571
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,751
So you don't believe

572
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,751
in God anymore?

573
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:27,714
That isn't something for you

574
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:27,714
to worry about.

575
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,507
I need to

576
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,507
figure this out myself.

577
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,760
Can I help? Maybe I could

578
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,760
provide a fresh perspective.

579
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,555
I don't think so, baby.

580
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,645
SHELDON:

581
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,645
Did you know that if gravity

582
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,063
were slightly

583
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,063
more powerful,

584
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,357
the universe would

585
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,357
collapse into a ball?

586
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,359
I did not.

587
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:52,405
Also, if gravity were

588
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:52,405
slightly less powerful,

589
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,240
the universe would

590
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,240
fly apart

591
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,617
and there would be

592
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,617
no stars or planets.

593
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,078
Where you going

594
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,078
with this, Sheldon?

595
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,915
It's just that gravity

596
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,915
is precisely as strong

597
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,374
as it needs to be.

598
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,377
And if the ratio of the

599
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,377
electromagnetic force

600
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,337
to the strong force

601
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,337
wasn't one percent,

602
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,881
life wouldn't exist.

603
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,258
What are the odds that

604
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,258
would happen all by itself?

605
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:16,303
Why are you trying to

606
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:16,303
convince me to believe in God?

607
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,097
You don't believe in God.

608
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,224
I don't, but the precision

609
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,224
of the universe

610
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,394
at least makes it logical to

611
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,394
conclude there's a creator.

612
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,355
(sighs)

613
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:32,361
Baby, I appreciate what you're

614
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:32,361
trying to do, but...

615
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,614
logic is here.

616
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,951
And my problem is here.

617
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,581
Well, there are 5 billion

618
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,581
people on this planet

619
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,667
and you're the

620
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,667
perfect mom for me.

621
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,045
What are the odds of that?

622
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:57,428
Oh.

623
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,557
Thank you, Lord,

624
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,557
for this little boy.

625
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,686
I knew I could fix it.

626
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,686
(laughs)

627
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:09,440
Maybe it was you

628
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:09,440
and the Lord.

629
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,567
ADULT SHELDON:

630
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,567
<i>I don't like sharing credit,</i>

631
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,903
<i>but I knew in that moment</i>

632
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,903
<i>it wasn't the appropriate time</i>

633
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,989
<i>to say it.</i>

634
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,834
And Jacob said: "For I have

635
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,834
seen God face to face,

636
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,003
and my life is preserved."

637
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,421
(whispering): Is this

638
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,421
an appropriate time to mention

639
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,589
that John 1:18 says,

640
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,049
"No man hath seen God

641
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,760
at any time."

642
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,760
Who's right?

643
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:38,970
Jacob or John?

644
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,889
Let's talk about it

645
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,889
in the car.

646
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,223
JEFF:

647
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,223
...the Lord.

648
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,266
Yes, Connie?

649
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,102
My grandson has a question.

650
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,812
(sighs)

651
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,981
Let 'er rip, kid.

1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,754
Mm-hmm. I'll tell him.

2
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:07,257
Sheldon, you need to go

3
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:07,257
to the principal's office.

4
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,343
STUDENTS:

5
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,343
Ooh...

6
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,345
You do that every time.

7
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,972
Why?

8
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:15,724
Uh-huh. Okay.

9
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:15,724
I'll be right there.

10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,727
What's up?

11
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,688
Principal wants to talk to me.

12
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,564
Ooh...

13
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:23,983
Grow up.

14
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:28,696
Hello!

15
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,071
Oh.

16
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,490
What are you doing here?

17
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,826
I got called to the

18
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,826
principal's office.

19
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,911
So did I.

20
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,038
(grunts)

21
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,748
What, you do something wrong?

22
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,917
Not that I'm aware of.

23
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,502
Did you?

24
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,463
I hope not.

25
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,425
Maybe it's good news.

26
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,928
(scoffs) Sheldon, you ever been

27
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,928
called to the principal's office

28
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:53,846
for good news?

29
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:55,890
Never.

30
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:55,890
Mm.

31
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,558
Gentlemen, good news.

32
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,977
I had a feeling. What's up?

33
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:02,855
We got the PSAT results back,

34
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:02,855
and Sheldon

35
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:05,357
got a perfect score.

36
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,275
Neat.

37
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,275
Thanks, Tom.

38
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,986
I'll be sure to put that

39
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,986
up on the fridge.

40
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:10,821
No, you don't understand.

41
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:13,114
Sheldon's the only kid

42
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:13,114
in the school to ever do this.

43
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,075
At his age,

44
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,075
maybe in the whole country.

45
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,911
It was fun. I enjoyed it.

46
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,412
So what's this mean?

47
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,998
It means he pitched

48
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,998
a perfect game, George.

49
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,625
I've already gotten calls from

50
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,625
colleges who want to meet him.

51
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,544
For, like,

52
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,544
scholarships and stuff?

53
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,879
For everything!

54
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,589
They might even pay you

55
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,589
to get him.

56
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,966
(laughs)

57
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,966
My man!

58
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,677
When was the last time

59
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,677
you washed your hands?

60
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,763

Can you believe it?

69
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,243
Perfect score.

70
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,704
(chuckles)

71
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,704
Good job, moon pie.

72
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,456
And not just that.

73
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,999
Colleges are already sniffing

74
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,999
around to recruit him.

75
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,043
What do you mean,

76
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,043
colleges? He's ten.

77
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:07,836
Principal Petersen said

78
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:07,836
Caltech is interested.

79
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,755
Where's Caltech?

80
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,506
California, Mom.

81
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,674
California?!

82
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,468
It has "Cal"

83
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,468
right there in the name.

84
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,136
You're not a part

85
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,136
of this conversation.

86
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,139
The "tech" is for "technology."

87
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,101
Shelly, go to your room.

88
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,101
The adults need to talk.

89
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,186
Given the events of the day,

90
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,186
I would argue I<i> am</i> an adult

91
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,272
and should be treated as one.

92
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,984
I probably could've

93
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,984
said that differently.

94
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,824
You honestly think that

95
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,824
little boy's ready for college?

96
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,784
Hey, I didn't think

97
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,784
he was ready for high school,

98
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,619
but here we are,

99
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,619
a year and a half in,

100
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,496
and no one got hurt.

101
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,496
That is different.

102
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,581
He's got you

103
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,581
and Georgie over there,

104
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,751
and he's still living at home

105
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,751
with his mother and his sister.

106
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,628
And me.

107
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,628
Sure.

108
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,088
I understand all that.

109
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,090
Then why are you

110
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,090
pushing so hard for this?

111
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,968
Because these schools

112
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,968
are interested now.

113
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,594
It's like

114
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,594
football recruitment.

115
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,096
You got to strike

116
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,096
while the iron's hot.

117
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,306
This is nothing

118
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,306
like football.

119
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,266
Oh, yeah?

120
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,266
What if he stops being smart

121
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,768
and they don't want him anymore?

122
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,812
How is that gonna happen?

123
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,356
I don't know. Conks his head?

124
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,900
Will you help me, please?

125
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,029
Sorry, I'm not a part

126
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,029
of this conversation.

127
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,909
At least Dad's on my side.

128
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,410
Doesn't matter.

129
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,410
Mom's gonna win.

130
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,912
She always does.

131
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,040
But I have to leave

132
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,040
for college at some point.

133
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,207
If you went to college,

134
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,207
you know what would happen?

135
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,751
I'd enjoy higher learning?

136
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,003
You would die.

137
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,005
You would curl up on the floor

138
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,005
and die.

139
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,631
That's not true.

140
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,424
You can't even take care

141
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,424
of your own boo-boos.

142
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,343
For your information,

143
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,343
every college is staffed

144
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,636
with a medical professional.

145
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,222
My boo-boos will be

146
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,222
well-tended to.

147
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,183
MARY: Sheldon!

148
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,183
Come back in here!

149
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,267
I guess we'll find out

150
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,267
what happened.

151
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,229
I already know what happened.

152
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,229
Mom won.

153
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,356
Well?

154
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:55,360
Shelly, I am very proud of you

155
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:55,360
for doing so well on that test.

156
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,946
But you can't go

157
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,946
off to college.

158
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,990
Mom!

159
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,990
In a few years, sure.

160
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,825
But, right now,

161
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,825
you can just keep taking

162
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,327
your one college class

163
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,327
with Dr. Sturgis.

164
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,247
Why can't I go<i> there</i> full-time?

165
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,666
Oh, baby, it's

166
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,666
an hour away.

167
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,835
We can't drive you back

168
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,835
and forth every day.

169
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,921
I'm the one who's

170
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,921
been driving him.

171
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,089
And she loves it.

172
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,839
How can he be so smart

173
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,760
and so clueless

174
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,760
at the same time?

175
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,471
Dr. Sturgis lives at the school.

176
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,471
What if he acted as my guardian?

177
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,639
That's an idea.

178
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,183
A crazy one.

179
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,102
But it would only be

180
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,102
on school nights.

181
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,478
Shelly.

182
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,478
What's the point

183
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,478
of being intelligent

184
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,941
if I can't take advantage

185
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,941
of opportunities like this?

186
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,279
They're still discussing.

187
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,281
Mom didn't win?

188
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,824
It's touch and go.

189
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,409
Crazy.

190
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,995
(sighs) Is staying with John

191
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,995
really that crazy?

192
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,414
(chuckles): Yes. He doesn't

193
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,414
know squat about kids.

194
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,999
Why are you even

195
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,999
considering this?

196
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,794
Well, the Lord gave Shelly

197
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,794
these abilities,

198
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,337
and I don't want to be the one

199
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,337
holding him back.

200
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,339
Okay. I'll ask him.

201
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,426
But I'm pretty sure I know

202
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,426
what answer you're gonna get.

203
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,595
Sure! What the heck?

204
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,516
Do you really think

205
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,516
you could handle

206
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,851
living with a ten-year-old?

207
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,686
Oh, he's only biologically ten.

208
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,522
In every other way,

209
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,522
he's as old as I am.

210
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,941
John, I don't think you realize

211
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,734
the responsibility

212
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,734
involved here.

213
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,736
Well, why don't we have

214
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,736
a trial run?

215
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:23,157
Have him spend a couple days

216
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:23,157
with me and see how it goes.

217
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:26,034
A trial run, huh?

218
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,452
Like the space program.

219
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,996
You don't send people up

220
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,039
right away;

221
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,039
you start by

222
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,126
spinning them around in that

223
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,126
thing that makes them throw up.

224
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,003
I don't know.

225
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,713
Connie, despite appearances,

226
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:43,093
I'm not some stereotypical

227
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:43,093
absentminded professor

228
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:45,344
who can't take care

229
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:45,344
of a houseplant.

230
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,847
No, no, I wasn't saying that.

231
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,849
Yeah, maybe I was.

232
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,391
Here's an idea.

233
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,352
Why don't you and Sheldon

234
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,352
come live with me?

235
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,897
And then you can take care

236
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,897
of both of us.

237
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:59,067
Trial run sounds

238
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:59,067
like the way to go.

239
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,236
Not ready to shack up, are you?

240
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,946
No.

241
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,946
Darn it.

242
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:06,825
The Earth is about

243
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:06,825
4.5 billion years old.

244
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,368
In the Cosmic Calendar, it's...

245
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,368
Shelly,

246
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,787
we need to talk to you.

247
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:11,913
All right.

248
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,040
(TV shuts off)

249
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,043
Meemaw spoke to

250
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,043
Dr. Sturgis...

251
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,044
And?

252
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,628
And...

253
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,881
he was open to

254
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,881
you staying.

255
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,299
Yes! When can I go?

256
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,051
Now, hold on. Before

257
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,051
you get ahead of yourself,

258
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,760
this is just a trial run,

259
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,760
for one night.

260
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,179
And even if

261
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,179
it goes well,

262
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,139
you're not starting

263
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,139
college tomorrow.

264
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:32,142
It's just to see if this is

265
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:32,142
an option for the future.

266
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,228
GEORGE SR.:

267
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,228
You understand?

268
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,228
Yes.

(beeping continues)

283
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,181
You know, Shelly, it's okay

284
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,181
if you're a little nervous.

285
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,266
You can tell me.

286
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,600
I'm not nervous.

287
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,935
All right.

288
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,979
When I was your age,

289
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,979
a lot of times,

290
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,731
I'd have to spend the weekend

291
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,731
with my grandparents,

292
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,566
and that always frightened me,

293
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,861
'cause they'd leave their teeth

294
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,861
all over the place.

295
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,239
I never told anybody,

296
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,239
but I wish I had.

297
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,367
That does sound upsetting.

298
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,367
Good thing I'm braver than you.

299
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,786
I'm just saying, it can be tough

300
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,414
sleeping in a new place

301
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,414
without your mom.

302
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,749
Dr. Sturgis will be there.

303
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,749
He's like a mom.

304
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,752
But he's really smart.

305
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,424
Welcome!

306
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,759
Come in, come in!

307
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:51,554
You like chalkboards, huh?

308
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,098
Indeed, I do.

309
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,098
Huh.

310
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,309
In fact, I even have one

311
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,309
in the bathroom.

312
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,312
You never know

313
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,312
when inspiration will strike.

314
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,148
I may be the luckiest boy

315
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,148
in East Texas.

316
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,607
I know it's Thursday,

317
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,526
so dinner will be

318
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,526
spaghetti and hot dogs.

319
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,154
And, for fun,

320
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:10,698
I have a few episodes

321
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:10,698
of<i> Cosmos</i> recorded.

322
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,243
Forget "maybe."

I<i> am</i> the luckiest boy.

324
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:16,788
Remember, it's a school night,

CARL SAGAN:

364
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,899
All my life,

365
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,569
I've wondered

366
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,569
about life beyond the Earth.

367
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,698
On those countless other planets

368
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,698
that we think circle other suns,

369
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,701
is there also life?

370
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,619
Might the beings

371
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,619
of other worlds resemble us,

372
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,789
or would they be

373
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,789
astonishingly different?

374
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,041
Do you believe there's

375
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,543
intelligent life

376
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,543
in the universe?

377
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,002
I have no doubt.

378
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,795
Why is that?

379
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,424
The Drake Equation claims

380
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,424
that there are at least

381
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:55,554
20 detectable civilizations

382
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:55,554

383
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,264
Interesting.

384
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,974
My sister likes to say

385
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,974
that I'm an alien.

386
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,643
I've often been called that.

387
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,646
Once by the praying

388
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,646
mantis in my dream.

389
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,400
Maybe we<i> are</i> aliens.

390
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,110
Perhaps.

391
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,529
Or maybe people

392
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,529
like you and me

393
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,531
were the original

394
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,531
inhabitants of Earth,

395
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:17,492
and everyone else

396
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:17,492
is from outer space.

397
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,411
Ooh, I like that better.

398
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,497
SAGAN: In the great dark between

399
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,497
the stars, there also are...

400
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,832
After dinner, want

401
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,832
to toast marshmallows

402
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,209
on a Bunsen burner?

403
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,419
Good gosh, yes.

404
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,504
Good morning, everybody.

405
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,504
Good morning.

406
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,381
Angela, look, you know,

407
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,381
I wanted to jot down

408
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,508
some household hints,

409
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,508
you know...

410
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,052
Want to go out and

411
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,052
get some ice cream?

412
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,262
I'm watching this.

413
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,514
Well, when it's over.

414
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,891
Not really.

415
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,144
Okay.

416
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,897
Want to play<i> Monopoly?</i>

417
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,897
I'll let you be the thimble.

418
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,857
And then he said,

419
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,857
"Boy, what a mess.

420
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,568
How about cleaning this up,

421
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,568
huh?"

422
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,945
Well, pooh to you.

423
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,947
(laughter over TV)

424
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,491
Oh, yeah.

425
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,242
What about the

426
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,242
little dog?

427
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,994
Nope.

428
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,289
Finally, we strike

429
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,289
the flint

430
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,626
while turning up the gas

431
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,626
of the Bunsen burner.

432
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,253
I don't say this often,

433
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,253
but that may have been

434
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,879
the perfect safety lecture.

435
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,298
Thank you.

436
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,343
You're my guest.

437
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,343
After you.

438
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,013
This is like

439
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,013
being around a campfire,

440
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,431
only I'm not miserable.

441
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:24,434
Would you like me

442
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:24,434
to sing a cowboy song

443
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,645
while we sit around

444
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,645
our makeshift campfire?

445
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,938
I would like that.

446
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,941
♪ Oh, pity the cowboy ♪

447
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,528

448
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:37,155

449
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,991

450
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,119
♪ There was blood

451
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,119
on the saddle ♪

452
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,622
♪ And blood all around ♪

453
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:48,916
♪ And a great big puddle

454
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:48,916
of blood ♪

455
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,211
♪ On the ground. ♪

456
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,089
(cheering, applause over TV)

457
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,633
CONTESTANT:

458
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,633
"N."

459
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,426
PAT SAJAK:

460
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,426
And there are two "N"s.

461
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,678
CONTESTANT:

462
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,678
All right.

463
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,762
You want to go bowl

464
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,762
a few frames?

465
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,599
Don't you see me

466
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,599
watching the<i> Wheel?</i>

467
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,351
You can just say "no."

468
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,186
No.

469
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,690
Have you talked

470
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,690
to John tonight?

471
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,774
Yeah.

472
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,774
And?

473
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:17,945
He and Sheldon were watching TV

474
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:17,945
without anybody yakking at 'em.

475
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,660
I'm going home.

476
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,289
Thanks for stopping by.

477
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:32,043
Buy a vowel. Buy a vowel.

478
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:37,340
If you like being tucked in,

479
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:37,340
I'm prepared to do it.

480
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,551
I practiced on a watermelon.

481
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,844
That's okay. I'm a self-tucker.

482
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,599
Very well. Now, I'll be

483
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,599
in my room if you need me.

484
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,141
Here's a glass of water

485
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,602
if you get thirsty.

486
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,270
And there's fresh chalk

487
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,270
on the blackboard

488
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,689
in case of any

489
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,689
late-night epiphanies.

490
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,524
Excellent.

491
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:58,570
Oh, and, uh...

492
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:58,570
if your meemaw asks

493
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,154
how I did tonight,

494
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,365
I hope you'll give me

495
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,365
a positive review.

496
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,533
Three stars.

497
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,826
Out of three?

498
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,826
Yes.

499
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,328
Wonderful!

500
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,210
Hi.

501
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,463
What do you want?

502
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,463
I baked you a pie.

503
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,922
Why?

504
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,591
Well, I was thinking

505
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,591
we haven't had

506
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,175
the best history as neighbors.

507
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,637
That's 'cause

508
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,637
we don't like each other.

509
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:27,098
Right, so I thought we could sit

510
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:27,098
down over a slice of rhubarb pie

511
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,559
and, you know,

512
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,559
forgive and forget.

513
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,646
I haven't done anything

514
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,646
that needs forgiving.

515
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:36,274
Okay, well,

516
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:36,274
that sounds like something

517
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,943
we could sit down

518
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,943
and talk about over the pie.

519
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,028
BILLY (in distance):

520
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,028
Mom, I'm bleeding again!

521
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,906
You know what, Mary?

522
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,906
I appreciate it,

523
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,617
but this isn't

524
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,617
a great time.

525
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,535
Bobbi stabbed Billy

526
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,535
in the leg with a fork.

527
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,953
Good Lord. Is he okay?

528
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,455
It was a plastic fork,

529
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,332
but it broke the skin

530
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,332
pretty good.

531
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,501
Oh, okay, I-I understand.

532
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,712
How about I take that pie

533
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,712
and give you a rain check?

534
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,712
Um, sure...

535
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,214
BILLY: I think there's mustard

536
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,214
in the fork holes!

537
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,758
Got to go.

538
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,301
You can keep the pan!

539
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,018
(echoing):

540
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,018
Sheldon.

541
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,895
Why are you running?

542
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,357
I just want to kiss you.

543
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,441
(screams)

544
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,819
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

545
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,366
Dr. Sturgis?

546
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,075
Oh, Sheldon.

547
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,910
So nice to see you.

548
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,788
I think you tripped

549
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,788
and hit your head.

550
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,456
I'm a bit woozy.

551
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,082
I better test for concussion.

552
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,459
What's your name?

553
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,044
John Burgess Sturgis.

554
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,797
Burgess Sturgis? Great name.

555
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,797
Thank you.

556
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,424
Who's the president

557
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,424
of the United States?

558
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,635
George Herbert Walker Bush.

559
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,387
I like Burgess Sturgis better.

560
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,222
'Cause it rhymes, sure.

561
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,558
Last question.

562
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,558
What is the only fermion

563
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,643
that may not have

564
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,643
an antiparticle?

565
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,395
The neutrino, of course.

566
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,021
I'm gonna rule out concussion.

567
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,357
To be fair,

568
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,357
it was an easy question.

569
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,443
True. Wait here. I'm going to go

570
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,443
get some ice for your head

571
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,445
and I'll fix you a hot beverage.

572
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:09,367
Oh. There's a, there's an

573
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:09,367
Earl Grey tea bag in the sink.

574
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,119
I think it still has

575
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,119
some oomph in it.

576
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,247
(indistinct chatter over TV)

577
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,460
Hey, what you doing?

578
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,629
Pretty much what it looks like.

579
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,548
Would you like some company?

580
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,008
Sure, I guess.

581
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,261
Of course, if you'd rather watch

582
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,261
TV, I could leave you alone.

583
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,722
Oh, no, no. No, it's a rerun.

584
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,557
But even if it weren't...

585
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,642
Ooh.

586
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,483
(crying)

587
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,611
Hey, what... what's wrong?

588
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:48,197
Nothing. Keep going.

589
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:48,197
(laughs)

590
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,075
(crying)

591
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,702
Mary?

592
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:56,456
George, I just miss

593
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:56,456
my little boy so much,

594
00:15:56,497 --> 00:16:00,460
and he's never gonna come back

595
00:15:56,497 --> 00:16:00,460
'cause he doesn't need his mama.

596
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,545
(chuckles): Oh, baby,

597
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,545
of course he'll come back.

598
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:06,758
No, you should've seen

599
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:06,758
how happy he was.

600
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,720
All right, well,

601
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,720
still got Georgie and Missy.

602
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,056
(crying loudly)

603
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,228
Uh, oh, dear.

604
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,897
(grunting)

605
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,900
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

606
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,109
Oh, dear.

607
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,820
(teakettle whistling)

608
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:30,072
Dr. Sturgis,

609
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:30,072
your tea is on fire!

610
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,534
(siren wailing,

611
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,534
fire truck horn honks)

612
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,329
Boy, it's a good thing

613
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,329
we did this trial run.

614
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,081
No kidding.

615
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,081
Ooh, it's chilly out.

616
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,676
Night.

617
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,220
I changed my mind.

618
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,222
I don't want to leave here ever.

619
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,558
You never have to.

620
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,228
What were you thinking,

621
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,228
letting me take care of a child?

622
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,563
I won't make that mistake again.

623
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:05,650
Do I look like Mary Poppins?

624
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,318
As smart as I am,

625
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,696
I tried to put out a fire

626
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,696
with oxygen and paper.

627
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,491
It's okay. No one got hurt.

628
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:18,037
I may actually have had

629
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:18,037
a concussion.

630
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,246
What are your symptoms?

631
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,500
It feels like there's hair

632
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,251
on my head.

633
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,296
(chuckles)

634
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,174
(sighs)

635
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,677
Hey. He okay?

636
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,261
Yeah, he's fine.

637
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,097
How you doing?

638
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,097
Much better.

639
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,058
(sighs)

640
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,852
(clears throat)

641
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,770
You know, I just been

642
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,770
sitting here thinking

643
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:46,858
how I drove an hour both ways

644
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:46,858
to bring the two of them back.

645
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,235
Pretty damn decent of me.

646
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,907
Come here.

647
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,907
(chuckles)

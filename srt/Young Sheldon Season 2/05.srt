00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,963
ADULT SHELDON:

00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,963
<i>While my sister and I</i>

3
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,963
<i>are twins, we've always</i>

4
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:05,756
<i>been different.</i>

5
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:05,756
<i>By the age of two,</i>

6
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:06,966
<i>I was reading books.</i>

7
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,134
<i>Missy was content to eat them.</i>

8
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,470
<i>By five, I had</i>

9
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,470
<i>a healthy appreciation</i>

10
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,681
<i>for a well-organized</i>

11
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,681
<i>work space.</i>

12
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,851
<i>My sister, less so.</i>

13
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,644
(Missy giggles)

14
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,644
<i>Which is not to say</i>

15
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:21,229
<i>she doesn't have</i>

16
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:21,229
<i>qualities I admire.</i>

17
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,481
Get it! Get it!

18
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,566
It's just a spider.

19
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,566
Calm down.

20
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,276
It's got eight

21
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,276
legs and fangs.

22
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,236
I see no reason

23
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,236
to be calm.

24
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,446
Did you kill it?

25
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,615
Yup.

26
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,615
Are you sure?

27
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,241
You tell me.

28
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,241

00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,077

30
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,077

Hello.

42
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:04,313
You got a minute?

43
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,358
John has something he wants

44
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,358
to talk to you about.

45
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,068
I brought you kolaches.

46
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,277
Ooh, yummy.

47
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,946
Mmm. Mmm. (chuckles)

48
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,781
So, what's up?

49
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,575
You comin' to me to ask

50
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,575
for Connie's hand in marriage?

51
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,117
No.

52
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,662
But if that were

53
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,662
to come to pass,

54
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:22,165
are you authorized

55
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:22,165
to bless the union?

56
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,711
He was joking.

57
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,170
Oh.

58
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:29,924
Tell him.

59
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:29,924
Okay.

60
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,633
So, some colleagues of mine

61
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,970
at the university are doing

62
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,970
a research study on twins.

63
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,765
I told them about

64
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,765
Sheldon and his sister,

65
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,808
and they were most intrigued.

66
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,061
Uh, what kind of study?

67
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,854
It's a longitudinal

68
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,854
investigation

69
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:46,147
of environmental

70
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:46,147
and genetic factors

71
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,068
in the development of cognitive

72
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,068
and other capacities

73
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,529
in pairs of fraternal

74
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,529
and identical twins.

75
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,907
You asked.

76
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:58,035
(chuckles): Well, geez,

77
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:58,035
I don't... I don't know

78
00:01:58,077 --> 00:02:00,287
if I want some scientists

79
00:01:58,077 --> 00:02:00,287
pokin' and proddin' the kids.

80
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,122
Oh, but they wouldn't

81
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,122
be poked and prodded.

82
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,875
They just have to, you know,

83
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,875
answer some questions.

84
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,586
And maybe some

85
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,586
puzzles and tests.

86
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,130
That's not too bad.

87
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,130
Where is it?

88
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,966
Houston.

89
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,966
Oh, it just got bad.

90
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,342
That's... that's a long drive.

91
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:18,138
It does pay $50 an hour

92
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:18,138
plus gas and expenses.

93
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,890
Really?

94
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:21,809
I told you to start with that.

95
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,061
Oh.

96
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,481
No. See, Mary,

97
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,481
that's the best part--

98
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,317
there's no pokin'

99
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,317
and proddin'. Plus,

100
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,653
you know how much

101
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,653
Sheldon loves puzzles and tests.

102
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,362
I'm not sure.

103
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,323
(sighs)

104
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,323
Think about the money.

105
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,118
50 bucks an hour,

106
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,118
four or five hours a week.

107
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,619
That-That's more than

108
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,619
our mortgage.

109
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,287
I know, I know.

110
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,956
But Sheldon's already

111
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,956
self-conscious

112
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,540
about being different

113
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,540
from other kids.

114
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,501
I worry how this might

115
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,501
affect him.

116
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,628
You're being too protective.

117
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,628
He's a rock.

118
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,212
A<i> rock?</i>

119
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,965
Are we raising

120
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,965
the same child?

121
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,675
And what about Missy?

122
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,426
Aren't these tests gonna

123
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,426
make her feel bad

124
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,053
that she's not

125
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,053
as smart as Sheldon?

126
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,847
(snorts)

127
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,847
I'm not as smart as Sheldon.

128
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,390
Doesn't make me feel bad.

129
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,019
And we could put the money aside

130
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,019
for their college education.

131
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,854
That's a good point.

132
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,605
It's a great point.

133
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,065
I don't have to tell you,

134
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,065
times are changing.

135
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,692
Kids are pitching in.

136
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,610
Like that Webster kid on TV--

137
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,988
he's making buckets

138
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,988
of money for his parents.

139
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,239
Well...

140
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,241
I suppose we could

141
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,241
give it a try.

142
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,201
There you go.

143
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,201
I'll call Sturgis,

144
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,871
tell him we're in.

145
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,914
Baby, I'm getting

146
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,914
a fishing boat.

147
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,172
So, Sheldon, Missy,

148
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,172
we got some exciting news.

149
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,507
Georgie took a bath?

150
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,507
No.

151
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,092
And how come I don't get

152
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,092
exciting news?

153
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,844
This isn't about you.

154
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,304
But after dinner, why

155
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,304
don't you go rinse off?

156
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,098
So, what's up?

157
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,098
Well,

158
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,808
a couple of scientists

159
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,808
at the college

160
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,351
where Dr. Sturgis teaches

161
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,351
are doing

162
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,478
a research

163
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,478
study on twins.

164
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,689
They want to meet you guys,

165
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,689
ask you some questions.

166
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,733
Oh, boy, a research study.

167
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,984
Will they give us written tests?

168
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,444
Yeah, I think so.

169
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,444
Oh, boy.

170
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,740
Now, you don't have to

171
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,740
do this if you don't want to.

172
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,033
It's purely volunteer.

173
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:02,576
I don't want to do it.

174
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,536
Why not?

175
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,536
They probably just

176
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,536
want to find out

177
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,372
why you're so smart

178
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,372
and I'm just average.

179
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,333
(quietly): Average?

180
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,333
That's a little generous.

181
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,877
Why don't they want

182
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,877
to test me?

183
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,879
Georgie, not now.

184
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,879
'Cause I'm available.

185
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,380
Listen, why don't we

186
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,380
just go there this Saturday

187
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,339
and give it a try?

188
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,801
And if you don't like it,

189
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,801
we don't have to do it again.

190
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,928
Or they'll love it,

191
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,928
and they'll do it till

192
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,722
they're 18, 19 years old.

193
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,224
I already love it.

194
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,726
My man. Missy?

195
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,938
I believe there might be

196
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,689
a Dairy Queen on the way there.

197
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,984
Can I get an Oreo Blizzard?

198
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,277
You know what I think?

199
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,863
I think you're smarter than him.

200
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,576
Dr. Thorpe and Dr. Pilson,

201
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,037
here are your

202
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,037
research volunteers,

203
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,288
Sheldon and Missy.

204
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,748
So nice to meet you.

205
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,792
Thank you for participating

206
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,792
in our study.

207
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,502
Always happy to help advance

208
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,502
our understanding of me.

209
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,255
I'm just in it

210
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,255
for the Dairy Queen.

211
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,132
All right.

212
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,259
Um, if you two wouldn't

213
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,259
mind waiting here,

214
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,594
we'd like to start by talking

215
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,594
to your mom, dad, and grandma.

216
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,763
Why?

217
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,306
Jut to get some

218
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,306
background information

219
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,142
on the both of you.

220
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,936
Smart. Ask how old I was when

221
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,936
I completed potty training.

222
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,146
You won't believe it.

223
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,606
I'll do that.

224
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,316
Will you keep an eye on 'em?

225
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:19,402
Well, I'll try, but

226
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:19,402
if they start running,

227
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,654
you may never see them again.

228
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,613
(laughs)

229
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,490
Shall we?

230
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,286
We are on the clock, right?

231
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,246
George.

232
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,246
Hmm?

233
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,255
(chuckles) Boy, this

234
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,255
brings back some memories.

235
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,507
How come?

236
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,507
Well, when I was your age,

237
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,801
I was also taken to a university

238
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,385
to be studied.

239
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,805
Because they thought

240
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,805
you were really smart?

241
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,349
Because they thought

242
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,349
I was clinically insane.

243
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,852
And it wasn't just me.

244
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,229
Did you know that

245
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,229
when Albert Einstein

246
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,273
was a little boy,

247
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,273
his parents worried

248
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:58,233
there was something

249
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:58,233
wrong with him?

250
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,194
Because he couldn't

251
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,194
comb his hair?

252
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:03,322
No, that was a choice

253
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:03,322
he made later in life.

254
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,990
When he was young,

255
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,784
he wanted nothing to do

256
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,784
with other children,

257
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:11,538
and would often have

258
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:11,538
extreme temper tantrums.

259
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,248
He sounds like you.

260
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,835
I know.

261
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,835
Isn't it great?

262
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,672
Well, to be perfectly honest,

263
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,216
Sheldon has always avoided

264
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,508
children his own age.

265
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,010
Tell 'em about

266
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,010
temper tantrums.

267
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,261
They're not temper tantrums,

268
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,138
he just has strong opinions.

269
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,514
(chuckles)

270
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,514
Yeah,

271
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,933
like when you yell

272
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,933
and stomp your feet,

273
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,853
and slam the door

274
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,853
off its hinge.

275
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,356
They're scientists.

276
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,356
You can't trick 'em.

277
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,110
And, as for Missy,

278
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,110
she's just the opposite.

279
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,196
Loves to be around people

280
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,196
and other kids.

281
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,697
Makes friends easy.

282
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,491
Does she have temper

283
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,491
tantrums as well?

284
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,035
Nope.

285
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,035
She's very even-keeled.

286
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,245
Except for when she's eating.

287
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,662
You put your hand

288
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,662
near her face

289
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,081
when she's working

290
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,081
on a lamb chop,

291
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,623
she will bite off a finger.

292
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,876
(laughs)

293
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,876
Our daughter doesn't bite.

294
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,462
Right here,

295
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,462
Thanksgiving, 1986.

296
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,760
Was there anything unusual

297
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,760
about your pregnancy?

298
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,221
No, not that I remember.

299
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,221
Really?

300
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,556
You cried for, like,

301
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,556
seven months.

302
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,516
Those were tears of joy.

303
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,516
(weak laugh)

304
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,560
What about all those times

305
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,560
you punched me?

306
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,479
Punches of joy.

307
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,774
You're not gonna get much

308
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,774
out of Fred and Wilma here.

309
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,151
Why don't you just

310
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,151
get crackin' on the kids?

311
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:28,949
Okay, Sheldon, this first

312
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:28,949
battery of tests measures

313
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,076
basic problem-solving abilities.

314
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:34,413
Is the Kaufman test or the

315
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:34,413
Wechsler Intelligence Scale?

316
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,040
Are you familiar with those?

317
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,376
It's embarrassing, but I enjoy

318
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,376
a little light reading

319
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:40,294
in the bathroom.

320
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:44,005
Okay.

321
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:44,005
Are you ready?

322
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,174
Will I be timed?

323
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,174
Yes.

324
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,594
Fantastic.

325
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,594
(stopwatch clicks)

326
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,388
Okay, Missy,

327
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,140
the first thing

328
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,140
we're gonna do is test

329
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,641
your problem-solving ability.

330
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,018
Okay.

331
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,018
You ready?

332
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,270
I just have one question.

333
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,562
What's that?

334
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,315
Do you always wear

335
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,315
your hair up?

336
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,776
Uh, well, usually at work, yes.

337
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,527
I bet it looks cute down.

338
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,489
Thank you.

339
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,489
Okay,

340
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,366
you're all set.

341
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,160
Is that camera

342
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,160
gonna be on?

343
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,453
Yes.

344
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,870
Can you move it

345
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,870
over to that side?

346
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,456
Why?

347
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,040
If I've learned one thing

348
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,040
from school picture day,

349
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,959
it's that I look better

350
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,959
from that side.

351
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,629
Sure, I'll move it.

352
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,965
Okay...

353
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,425
And bring it a little closer.

354
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,595
How's that?

355
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:34,597
Great.

356
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:34,597
Okay.

357
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,558
(sighs)

358
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,558
Whenever you're ready.

359
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,558
Wait.

360
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,811
Do I have any Oreos

361
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,811
in my teeth?

362
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,604
No.

363
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:43,357
Ready to start?

364
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:43,357
One last thing.

365
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,234
Did you ever think of wearing

366
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,234
that white coat with a belt?

367
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,445
No.

368
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,445
You should.

369
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,280
'Cause you have

370
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,280
a very nice figure,

371
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:52,949
and it's lost in there.

372
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,204
Hey, check this out.

373
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,789
Did you see

374
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,789
<i>Honey, I Shrunk the Kids?</i>

375
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,749
No.

376
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,749
You should.

377
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,044
'Cause there's a lot of

378
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,044
good science stuff in it.

379
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,295
(laughing)

380
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,214
Kudos on the question

381
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,674
"Which train gets

382
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,674
to St. Louis first?"

383
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,301
Hmm.

384
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,430
I have to tell you something.

385
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,307
Why don't you

386
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,307
finish the test first.

387
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,808
This can't wait.

388
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,102
The other doctor's

389
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,102
got a crush on you.

390
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,854
Oh, dear Lord.

391
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,231
Oh, um...

392
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,816
I don't...

393
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,816
I don't think so.

394
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,485
Let's get back to the test.

395
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,487
Okay.

396
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,324
Why? What did you see?

397
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:37,035
When you're not looking,

398
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:37,035
he stares at your tushy.

399
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,119
(whispering):

400
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,119
Really?

401
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,080
Imagine if you

402
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,080
wore the belt.

403
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,665
Clever girl.

404
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,585
That would accentuate

405
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,585
her buttocks.

406
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,173
I can't watch. Switch

407
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,173
it back to Sheldon.

408
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,428
Hot dog, syllogisms.

409
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,054
If all squares

410
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,054
are parallelograms,

411
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,223
and all squares

412
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,223
are rectangles,

413
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,392
then some parallelograms

414
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,392
are rectangles.

415
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:03,019
Who was this test

416
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:03,019
made for, children?

417
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,105
I'm bored.

418
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,105
Turn it back to Missy.

419
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,149
Go ahead.

420
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,735
This question about a train

421
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,735
going to "S-T" Louis

422
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,612
makes no sense.

423
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,990
DR. THORPE:

424
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,990
It's okay to guess.

425
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,993
Take your time, baby.

426
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,993
The meter's running.

Well, thank you all very much.

430
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,042
This was a great start.

431
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,211
Thank you.

432
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,211
Did you have fun?

433
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,298
I got to take a test

434
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,298
on a Saturday, heck yeah!

435
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:35,135
He's like a young version of me,

436
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:35,135
but without corrective shoes.

437
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,511

438
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:37,596
Missy, what'd you think?

439
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,930
The tests were

440
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,930
just okay,

441
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,265
but I like Sandra.

442
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,935
Well, thank you, Missy.

443
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,935
I like you, too.

All right,

we'll see y'all next Saturday.

00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,317
You bet we will.

448
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,570
Good God, George,

449
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,570
have a little dignity.

450
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,407
Hm.

451
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:01,328
Are you doing something

452
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:01,328
different with your hair?

453
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:05,248
No, uh, why?

454
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,502
No reason, just looks nice.

Thank you.

458
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,132
about maybe stopping

459

for a drink after,

460
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,760

I like trains.

00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,912
It's not that kind

472
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,912
of train, dummy.

473

is doing to Sheldon.

481
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,809
What're you talking about?

482
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,809
He had a great time.

483
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,645
All the way home

484
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,645
all he could talk about

485
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,356
is how that doctor thought he

was so smart. It's not healthy.

487
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,899
Would it make you

feel any better

489
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,859
if I told you how much money

Sheldon, what do you think

502
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,265
is happening in this picture?

503
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,142
Easy. There are four chimpanzees

504
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,142
in a living room.

00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,437
PILSON:

506
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,437
Okay, but what can you

507
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,437
tell me about them?

508
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,898
They're not behaving

509
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,898
like chimpanzees.

510
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,982
Anything else?

511
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,736
Chimpanzees don't drink tea.

512
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,405
Is that it?

513
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,989
Well, I suppose

514
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,989
it might be coffee,

515
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,658
but they don't

516
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,658
drink that either.

517
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,953
Anything interesting

518
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,953
about their body language?

519
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:09,872
No.

520
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,250
I think they found

521
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,250
his kryptonite.

Missy,

524
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,381
what do you think

525
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,381
is happening in this picture?

526
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,841
The girl monkey on the couch

527
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,636
is telling the

528
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,636
guy monkey a secret.

529
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,179
Must be something juicy,

530
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,179
'cause he's smiling.

531
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,514
Anything else?

532
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,890
It might be dirty,

533
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,309
'cause this girl monkey

534
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,309
is sending

535
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,727
the kid monkey out of the room.

536
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,146
He doesn't want to go.

537
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,146
He looks sad.

538
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,439
Is that all?

539
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,399
The monkeys on the couch

540
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,399
are drinking tea,

541
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,900
so it's a tea party.

542
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:41,112
Okay, very good.

543
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:41,112
Let's look at another picture.

544
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,616
I'm not done.

545
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,616
The monkey in the painting

546
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:45,866
is wearing an old lady hat,

547
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,826
so she's probably

548
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,826
a meemaw monkey.

549
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,037
She's not

550
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,037
at the party,

551
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,874
so she must be bowling or dead.

552
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,919
Well, Missy

553
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,919
won that round.

554
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,255
It's actually

555
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,255
not a contest, George.

556
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,466
This is Texas.

557
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,466
Everything's a contest.

558
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,926
A woman in a doorway.

559
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,345
Anything else?

560
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,514
She's holding her head

561
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,514
with her hand.

562
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,516
And what do you think

563
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,516
that means?

564
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,476
Um...

565
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,936
Wouldn't you rather ask me

566
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,936
about trains going to St. Louis?

567
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,273
Good gravy, she's sad,

568
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,273
Sheldon, come on.

569
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,567
Oh, she's very upset.

570
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,653
I don't know why.

571
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,530
Oh! Maybe she wasn't invited

572
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,448
to the tea party

573
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,448
at the monkey house.

574
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,033
(chuckles)

575
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,327
Also, she's wearing a belt,

576
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,327
like you are.

577
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,371
Nice going.

578
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,371
Very cute.

579
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,290
(mouths)

580
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,667
And I'm loving the hair.

581
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,544
(whispers):

582
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,544
Yeah.

583
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,004
A lion sitting in a chair,

584
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,004
holding a pipe.

585
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,297
Good.

586
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,466
But what do you think

587
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,466
is on his mind?

588
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,468
How should I know?

589
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,468
Maybe he's wondering

590
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,303
why he's posing

591
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,303
for a silly picture

592
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,555
instead of eating a gazelle.

593
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,724
PILSON:

594
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,724
Anything else?

595
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,643
What exactly are we doing here?

596
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,269
I thought the purpose

597
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,269
of this study

598
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,146
was to find out how smart I am.

599
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,065
PILSON:

600
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,065
That's what we're doing,

601
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,900
but there are different kinds

602
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,900
of intelligence.

603
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,694
Poppycock!

604
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,028
There's only one kind

605
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,028
of intelligence...

606
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,780
George, Sheldon's getting upset.

607
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,323
I don't like it.

608
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,868
All right, I'll just

609
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,868
change it back to Missy.

610
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,328
You are an insightful

611
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,328
young lady.

612
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,455
I don't know what that

613
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,455
means, but thank you.

614
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,624
It means perceptive.

615
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,835
You see things most people miss.

616
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:21,212
My name is Missy-- go figure.

617
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,381
Have you always been that way?

618
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,175
I guess so. I think when

619
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,175
you're on your own a lot,

620
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,219
you get good at seeing

621
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,219
that kind of stuff.

622
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,346
THORPE: Really?

623
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,346
MISSY: My dad

624
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,348
does football

625
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,348
with my older brother,

626
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,268
so they're like a team.

627
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,730
And my mom and meemaw spend all

628
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,730
their time fussing over Sheldon,

629
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,607
so they're like a team, too.

630
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,859
So no one's on your team?

631
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,235
Nope.

632
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,779
It's just me.

633
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,488
Oh, Lord.

634
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,284
Hey, what's up with you

635
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,284
and Dr. Pillsbury?

636
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,703
Dr. Pilson?

637
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,330
I don't know what

638
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,330
you're talking about.

639
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,040
Oh.

640
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,167
You can't say

641
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,167
'cause we're on camera.

642
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,587
(sighs)

643
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,964
Insightful.

644
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,513
A little late for me

645
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,513
to start cooking.

646
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,849
Why don't we stop

647
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,849
somewhere for dinner.

648
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,849
Really?

649
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,477
The five of us?

650
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,477
That's kind of pricey.

651
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,605
Would you rather

652
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,605
buy a fishing boat?

653
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,315
You're a blabbermouth,

654
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,315
you know that?

655
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,983
(Meemaw laughs)

656
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,152
Missy, we're gonna

657
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,152
eat in a restaurant.

658
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,445
Where would you

659
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,445
like to go?

660
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,280
I get to pick?

661
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,865
Why don't I

662
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,865
get to pick?

663
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,325
Because your sister's

664
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,325
getting to pick.

665
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,868
It's not just about you

666
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,868
in this house.

667
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,830
What do you think, baby?

668
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,581
I pick...

669
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,583
Red Lobster.

670
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,418
You got it.

671
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,295
Damn.

672
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,172
There goes our per diem.

673
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,263
ANNOUNCER: Out of an

674
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,263
I formation, it's the option...

675
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,473
George, you got a minute?

676
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,766
What's up?

677
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,766
Not you,

678
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,352
him.

679
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,352
What?

680
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,021
Sheldon told me that we get paid

681
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,021
to go to that college

682
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,564
and answer their questions.

683
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,191
Yeah, so?

684
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,609
I want to know

685
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,609
how much we're making.

686
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,569
Why?

687
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,113
'Cause I want my fair share.

688
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,449
Is that so?

689
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,868
What do you think

690
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,868
your fair share is?

691
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,077
Half.

692
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:20,205
Hm, guess that sounds right.

693
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,790
So how much are we making?

694
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,460
$7.50 a week.

695
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,838
Really?

696
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,838
Really.

697
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,965
Well, I want half that.

698
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,257
Which is?

699
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,635
Hang on.

700
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,304
Sheldon!

701
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,056
Can we put on<i> </i>

702
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,056
<i>Soul Train?</i>

703
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,725
Why?

704
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,435
There's a girl on there

705
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,435
I kind of want to marry.

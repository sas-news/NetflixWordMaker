00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:02,836
ADULT SHELDON:

2
00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:02,836
<i>I'd like to tell you a story</i>

3
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:04,254
<i>about a time I was right.</i>

4
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:05,589
<i>Now, I'm sure you're thinking,</i>

5
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,300
<i>"But, Sheldon,</i>

6
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,300
<i>you're never wrong."</i>

7
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:11,261
<i>And you'd be right.</i>

8
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,305
<i>But it's worth taking</i>

9
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,305
<i>a closer look</i>

10
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,183
<i>at this particular incident.</i>

11
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,560
<i>Because it began</i>

12
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,560
<i>with a loaf of bread,</i>

13
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,771
<i>and ended with me and my family</i>

14
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:25,108
<i>almost being kicked out of</i>

15
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:25,108
<i>the United States of America.</i>

16
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,364
Uh-oh.

17
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,115
What's the matter?

18
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:34,284
Something's wrong

19
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:34,284
with my sandwich.

20
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,870
Did it go bad?

21
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:39,456
No. It just tastes... different.

22
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:42,083
If you don't want it,

23
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:42,083
I'll trade you for my dumplings.

24
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,669
I'm already unhappy.

25
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,671
Do you really think dumplings

26
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,671
will fix the problem?

27
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,924
It'll fix my problem.

28
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,924
I'm sick of dumplings.

29
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:51,176
(phone rings)

30
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,554
Mary Cooper,

31
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,554
how may I bless you?

32
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,638
SHELDON:

33
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,638
Hello, Mom?

34
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,348
Sheldon? Everything okay?

35
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,892
No.

36
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,892
What's wrong?

37
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,686
What happened?

38
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,686
My sandwich tastes different.

39
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,022
(sighs) You know you're not

40
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,022
supposed to call

41
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,313
unless it's an emergency.

42
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,150
I'm well aware.

43
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,150
So what did you change?

44
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,736
I didn't change anything.

45
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,613
Same bread, same peanut butter,

46
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,613
same jelly.

47
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,700
Did you use one knife

48
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,700
for the PB and the J?

49
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:17,244
No.

50
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:17,244
Are you sure?

51
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,538
That was one time two years ago,

52
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,122
and all the other knives

53
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,122
were dirty.

54
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,166
It was 14 months

55
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,166
and 11 days ago.

56
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,502
When we made the big switch

57
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,502
from Wonder Bread.

58
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:26,670
Oh, how could I forget?

59
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:29,048
Sheldon, I didn't

60
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:29,048
change anything.

61
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,799
Can I get back to work now?

62
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,176
I suppose so.

63
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,720
Thank you. Bye.

64
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,388
Don't I get an "I love you"?

65
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,139
I love you.

66
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,684
One more time,

67
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,684
with a little more energy.

68
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,729
(phone hangs up,

69
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,729
dial tone sounds)

70
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:46,690
Must've been disconnected.

71
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:49,735
Well, my mother didn't do

72
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:49,735
anything differently.

73
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,403
Are you gonna eat it?

74
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,698
Better. I'm going

75
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,698
to do science on it.

76
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,451
(sighs)

77
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,451
I would eat it.

78
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,621
Are the goggles necessary?

79
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,331
No, but they really

80
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,331
set the mood.

81
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,668
Okay, subject "A," jelly.

82
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:14,384
That's definitely strawberry

83
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:14,384
and definitely Smuckers.

84
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,054
Subject "B."

85
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,935
That's Jif all right.

86
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,935
Creamy and delicious.

87
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,269
It must be the bread.

88
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:28,065
Hold on. This is a

89
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:28,065
scientific experiment.

90
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:29,441
We can't make

91
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:29,441
assumptions.

92
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,694
Subject "C."

93
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,696
It's the bread.

94

(sniffles)

102
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:07,896
Hey.

103
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,691
Oh. Hey, Georgie.

104
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,650
You okay?

105
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,527
Mm-hmm.

106
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,569
You sure?

107
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,655
Not really.

108
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:20,034
Um... Dustin broke up with me.

109
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,410
What?

110
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,788
He said I was immature.

111
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,788
(sniffs)

112
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,040
Is he crazy?

113
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,001
Everything about you

114
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,001
screams womanhood.

115
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,586
See?

116
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,131
Happy Hearth Home Bakeries,

117
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,131
just like always.

118
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,425
Well, something is rotten

119
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,425
in the state of Denmark.

120
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,425
What?

121
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,845
That's Shakespeare, Mom.

122
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,845
Great.

123
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,305
Missy, did your sandwich

124
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,305
taste different today?

125
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,725
Couldn't tell you.

126
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,725
I traded it for a Ding Dong.

127
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,728
Your sandwich is exactly

128
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,728
the same, Sheldon.

129
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:49,813
What's going on?

130
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,272
This bread is different.

131
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,691
Let me see.

132
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,485
You know, he

133
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,485
might be right.

134
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,696
Ow.

135
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,948
Shelly, it's probably

136
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,948
just your taste buds

137
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,408
changing as you get older.

138
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,868
But I don't like change.

139
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,745
Then you're gonna

140
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,745
hate puberty.

141
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,623
Got me with your ring.

142
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,459
She wasn't wrong.

143
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,961
Studies do support

144
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,961
that your sense of taste

145
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,421
changes over time.

146
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,714
So the bread's the same

147
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,714
and you're different?

148
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,466
Apparently so.

149
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,555
Nope, it's the bread.

150
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,100
(school bell rings)

151
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,276
Hey.

152
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,445
Hi.

153
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,864
I was wondering if you wanted

154
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,864
to grab a bite to eat

155
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,282
at the Waffle House?

156
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,952
Not like a date.

157
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,370
But as someone who recently

158
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,370
had his heart broke,

159
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,872
I think I could help.

160
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,791
Who broke<i> your</i> heart?

161
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,542
I love you.

162
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,461
(others gasping)

163
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,461
Ooh!

164
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,545
You did.

165
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,714
Oh. Yeah.

166
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,300
I'm just saying,

167
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,136
I know what

168
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,136
you're going through.

169
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,679
So if you need a friend with

170
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,679
a pocket full of waffle money...

171
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,473
(chuckles)

172
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,810
(woman speaks indistinctly

173
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,810
over P.A.)

174
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,478
TAM:

175
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,478
Look at these prices.

176
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,188
No wonder supermarkets

177
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,188
are running my parents

178
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,648
out of business.

179
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,608
Your parents own

180
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,608
a convenience store.

181
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,777
They charge extra

182
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,777
for the convenience.

183
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,487
How is this not convenient?

184
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,696
Excuse me, sir.

185
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,115
Has anything changed

186
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,115
with the bread

187
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,408
from the Happy Hearth

188
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,408
Home Bakeries?

189
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,618
I have no idea.

190
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,829
How can you not know?

191
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,829
You work here.

192
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,080
What do you want from me?

193
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,540
I get $3.35 an hour

194
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,540
to stock shelves.

195
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,750
Are you kidding?

196
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,003
My father pays me

197
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,003
five dollars a week.

198
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,423
I bet they're violating

199
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,423
child labor laws.

200
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,925
Look. This loaf says

201
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,970
"A subsidiary of the Domestic

202
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,970
Food Corporation."

203
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,429
This older loaf doesn't.

204
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,890
I wonder if I can take

205
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,890
my parents to court?

206
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,810
(sniffs)

207
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,810
It smells like my bread.

208
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,437
Or I could start a labor union

209
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,437
with my sisters.

210
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,481
This is it!

211
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,481
This is my bread!

212
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,275
We could go on strike.

213
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,527
Bring them to their knees.

214
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,029
SHELDON:

215
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,029
Vindication!

216
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,909
(phone rings)

217
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,328
Happy Hearth Home Bakeries,

218
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,205
this is Pete.

219
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,205
How can I help you?

220
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,956
Hello, Pete.

221
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,956
My name is Sheldon Cooper,

222
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,042
and I would like to know

223
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,042
what changed

224
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,169
in your white sandwich loaf

225
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,169
to make it taste different?

226
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,546
Sheldon, hang up the phone.

227
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,546
It's dinner time.

228
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,674
Be right there, Mom. I'm doing

229
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,674
battle with corporate America.

230
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,591
I'm sorry, Pete.

231
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,135
You were saying?

232
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,762
Any chance your bread was past

233
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,762
the expiration date?

234
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,057
No, it was brand-new.

235
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,057
But I did a taste comparison

236
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,809
after it was bought out by

237
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,809
the Domestic Food Corporation,

238
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,187
and they are definitely

239
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,187
not the same.

240
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,690
Well, I can assure you that,

241
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,690
"the recent acquisition

242
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,651
"by the Domestic Food

243
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,651
Corporation has not affected

244
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,820
"the quality of our products

245
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,820
in any way.

246
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,698
"Every single bread, baked good,

247
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,698
and pastry

248
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,201
is made with love.

249
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,201
From our hearth to your home."

250
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,995
Then why does it taste

251
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,995
different, Pete? Why?

252
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,580
Well, because

253
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,580
now we make everything

254
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,083
really cheap and fast. Bye.

255
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,797
I thought Dustin

256
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,797
was different.

257
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,300
I thought he wanted to live

258
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,300
a Christian life like me.

259
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,929
But... all he wanted

260
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,929
is what every guy wants.

261
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,764
(scoffs)

262
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,764
Guys.

263
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,683
Oh, please, you're

264
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,683
all the same.

265
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,270
Hey. You rejected me,

266
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,270
you punched me in the face,

267
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,231
and I'm still here.

268
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,607
Happy eating waffles with you.

269
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:24,652
Georgie, do you really think

270
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:24,652
you're capable

271
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,029
of just being my friend?

272
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,865
That's a good question.

273
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,118
My brain says yes.

274
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,953
What about the rest of you?

275
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,455
Honestly, I wouldn't trust it.

276
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,664
(laughs)

277
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,961
Excuse me. Would you

278
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,961
like to sign my petition

279
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,462
against Happy Hearth

280
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,462
Home Bakeries?

281
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,881
Maybe on the way out.

282
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,259
Excuse me. Would you like

283
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,259
to sign my petition

284
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,219

285
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,219
Home Bakeries?

286
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,430
Oh. Maybe on the way out.

287
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,680
I hate to say it.

288
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,141
But everybody's way out

289
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,850
is at the other

290
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,850
set of doors.

291
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,854
I have noticed.

292
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,854
Why do you think that is?

293
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,565
Cowards. The whole

294
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,565
bunch of 'em.

295
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,319
Mr. Givens!

296
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,780
(sighs)

297
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,780
Hello, Sheldon.

298
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,491
Meemaw, this is my science

299
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,491
teacher, Mr. Givens.

300
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,160
Nice to meet ya.

301
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,160
Hi.

302
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,786
This is strange,

303
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,786
I never think of you

304
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,579
as existing outside

305
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,579
of school.

306
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,706
Well, it turns out I do.

307
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,875
And you're here

308
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,875
buying food.

309
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,502
I am.

310
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,379
Fascinating.

311
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,256
All right.

312
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:27,882
Well, I'll see you on Monday.

313
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:27,882
Wait.

314
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,634
Would you like

315
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,634
to sign my petition

316
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,927

317
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,927
Home Bakeries?

318
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,304
Well, what have they done?

319
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,054
They're making their bread

320
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,054
faster and cheaper

321
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,097
to save money.

322
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,808
That's terrible.

323
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,311
It is. Would you like to sign?

324
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,355
I would.

325
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,355
Excellent.

326
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,565
I'll get you on the way out.

327
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,565
Thank you.

328
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,152
Well, that's one.

329
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,488
Yeah.

330
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,288
GEORGE JR.:

331
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,288
I know it's tough,

332
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,288
but you gotta be strong.

333
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,832
And remember,

334
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,832
you're not alone.

335
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:01,875
Hello?

336
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,460
Kinda busy.

337
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:04,961
Well, there's only one bathroom

338
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:04,961
in the house, Georgie,

339
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,921
and it's not

340
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,921
for phone calls.

341
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,089
I got to call you back.

342
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,509
Sorry.

343
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,260
Who you talking to?

344
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,970
That Veronica girl?

345
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:14,929
Yeah.

346
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,181
What's going on with that?

347
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,932
Nothing. We're

348
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,932
just friends.

349
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,602
Okay. You ever want to run

350
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,602
any of this stuff by me,

351
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,729
I'm here for you.

352
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,898
Why would I want

353
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,898
to run it by<i> you?</i>

354
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,484
Well, I was once

355
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,484
a 15-year-old boy.

356
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,445
I know what it's like to have

357
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,445
strong feelings for a girl.

358
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:34,449
Gross. I'm not gonna

359
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:34,449
talk to you about this.

360
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,493
I-I saw that kid

361
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,493
on<i> Who's the Boss</i>

362
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,745
talk to Tony Danza

363
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,745
about<i> his</i> problems.

364
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,873
They're not related.

365
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,873
This is totally different.

366
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,424
Damn it, Georgie, you could

367
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,424
flush once in a while.

368
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,424
(toilet flushes)

369
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:53,176
On behalf of

370
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:53,176
sandwich-loving children

371
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,969
everywhere, I thank you.

372
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,847
How many is that?

373
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,847
13.

374
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,558
A baker's dozen.

375
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,558
What do you say we

376
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,309
pack up and head

377
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,309
outta here?

378
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,395
No, we have to wait

379
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,395
for Channel 7 news.

380
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,645
Channel 7?

381
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,314
Yes. I called them this morning

382
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,732
and told them

383
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,732
there was a human interest story

384
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,067
at the supermarket.

385
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,068
What story?

386
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,570
Classic Americana.

387
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,280
Little guy

388
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,280
versus corporate greed.

389
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,032
Honey, Channel 7

390
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,032
is not coming.

391
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,742
(horn honks)

392
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,660
You Sheldon Cooper?

393
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,745
Yes, ma'am.

394
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,205
You got to be kidding me.

395
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,498
How's my hair look?

396
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,048
Hey, how'd it go?

397
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,758
Great.

398
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,758
Turn to Channel 7.

399
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,009
But I'm watching

400
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,009
the game.

401
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,095
But I'm going

402
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,095
to be on Channel 7.

403
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,179
What's he talking about?

404
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,099
He's gonna be on Channel 7.

405
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,394
SHELDON (on TV):

406
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,394
I was shocked to learn

407
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,271
that the Happy Hearth Home

408
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,271
Bakeries had been bought out

409
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,022
by the Domestic

410
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,022
Food Corporation,

411
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,484
and they started making

412
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,484
their bread faster and cheaper.

413
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,944
And you don't

414
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,944
like that, do you?

415
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,944
No.

416
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,571
REPORTER:

417
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,571
And you're collecting signatures

418
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,448
to make them stop.

419
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,448
I am.

420
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,825
Corporations

421
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,825
shouldn't be allowed to make

422
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,201
these decisions on their own.

423
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,620
REPORTER:

424
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,620
Well, who should?

425
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,288
The people who eat the bread.

426
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,748
This wouldn't happen if there

427
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,748
were centralized control

428
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,167
over all these big corporations.

429
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,709
REPORTER:

430
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,709
Are you suggesting

431
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,838
a communist form of government

432
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,838
in Texas?

433
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,922
I suppose I am.

434
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,299
MEEMAW:

435
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,299
Hang on a sec...

436
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,177
There you have it.

437
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,177
Local boy Sheldon Cooper

438
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,555
says communism

439
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,555
is what Texas needs.

440
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,681
Oh, dear God.

441
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,521
I just... You...

442
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,772
Why... I-I-I-I-I...

443
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,898
Why would you...

444
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,276
What were you th...

445
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,944
Oh, God.

446
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,944
MARY:

447
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,944
Calm down.

448
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,155
It was just the 4:00 news.

449
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,155
I'm sure no one saw it.

450
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,490
I hope a lot of people saw it

451
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,782
and Happy Hearth is forced

452
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,451
to give our country

453
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,451
good bread again.

454
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:42,743
No! No more bread.

455
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,871
No more country.

456
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,871
No more talking.

457
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,290
Excuse me.

458
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,000
Where are you going?

459
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,044
I'm gonna go put up an American

460
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,044
flag in front of my house.

461
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,587
That's a great idea.

462
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,587
Mare, where's our flag?

463
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,548
Uh, uh, it's in the garage.

464
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,759
Is something wrong?

465
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,555
Yes, Sheldon,

466
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,555
something is wrong.

467
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,806
(doorbell rings)

468
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,806
Oh, now what?

469
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,061
Is anybody going to fill me in?

470
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,022
Not a good time, Brenda.

471
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,483
I don't want your boy playing

472
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,483
with my boy anymore.

473
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,943
Excuse me?

474
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,943
(phone ringing)

475
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,153
Someone get that!

476
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,155
I just saw Sheldon on the news.

477
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,365
He doesn't need to be filling

478
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,201
Billy's head

479
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,201
with crazy commie ideas.

480
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,744
Crazier than sitting on an egg

481
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,744
and trying to hatch it?

482
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,623
'Cause I saw your precious son

483
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,623
do that the other day.

484
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,125
Oh, so you're spying on us.

485
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,545
Good to know.

486
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,838
(grunts)

487
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,757
Yes, I do understand we're

488
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,757
in the middle of a cold war.

489
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,260
But have you seen

490
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,221
how many people wait in

491
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,221
line for bread in Moscow?

492
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,640
It stands to reason their

493
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,640
bread must be great.

494
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:46,849
Who you talking to?

495
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,561
A reporter from<i> Time</i> magazine.

496
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,561
No!

497
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,312
He didn't mean it.

498
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,897
God bless America.

499
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,233
(exhales)

500
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,910
Traitors.

501
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,910
Yeah, go back to Russia.

502
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,828
Go back?

503
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,956

504
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,956
in the first place.

505
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,708
Well, have a great

00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,708
day, Georgie.

507
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,544
A great day?

508
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,544
Are you out of your mind?

509
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,170

00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,030
All right, George.

584
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,950
But if I hear

585
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,950
from one more angry parent...

586
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,828
Thank you. Thank you.

587
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,873
(phone rings)

588
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:59,041
He's not here.

589
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,549
Mary, you understand

590
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,549
these people are atheists.

591
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,217
I get it. They're not my people.

592
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,803
You're my people.

593
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,178
Then what's this all about?

594
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,097
My son just wanted

595
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,097
a better sandwich.

596
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,141
Why is this so hard

597
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,141
for y'all to understand?!

607
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,208

Three, two...

609
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,376
Thanks for having me on.

610
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,629
You're welcome.

611
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,629
Now, I understand

612
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,130
you wanted to set

613
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,130
the record straight

614
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,924
regarding your

615
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,924
son's communism.

616
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,342
Yes. N-No!

617
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,761
He's not a communist.

618
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,761
He's ten years old.

619
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,847
Listen,

620
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,847
I fought for this country.

621
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,348
I love this country.

622
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,850
My kids love this country.

623
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,058
Isn't that right, Sheldon?

624
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,560
Yes.

625
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,395
Although, in all fairness,

626
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,648
the Social Security system

627
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,648
<i>is</i> a form of...

628
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,983
You love this country!

629
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,983
I love this country.

630
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,246
I have something important

631
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,246
that I'd like to say.

632
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,667
These last few days,

633
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,419
I've been giving

634
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,419
the new Happy Hearth bread

635
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,671
another chance,

636
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,671
and I've decided

637
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,464
it's not so bad.

638
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,635
Also, it toasts well.

639
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,639
So, I'm going to say

640
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,517
that's a sign of personal

641
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,517
growth on my part.

642
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,311
In fact, let's call it maturity.

643
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,652
Still not talking to me, huh?

644
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:54,365
Well...

645
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:54,365
I'll check back in tomorrow.

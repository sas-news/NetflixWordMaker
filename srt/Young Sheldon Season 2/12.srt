1
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:03,504
Now, can anyone tell me

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:06,340
why Melville shifts

3
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:06,340
the narrative voice

4
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:09,092
from Ishmael to Ahab?

5
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,058
(sighs)

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,935
Sheldon.

7
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:19,227
I have a tummyache.

8
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,813
I'd like to see the nurse.

9
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:22,230
A "tummyache"?

10
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,567
Yes, Derek,

11
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,567
I have a tummy and it aches.

12
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,068
Ergo, tummyache.

13
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,028
Ergo?

14
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,488
It's Latin, Derek.

15
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,072
Go to the nurse.

16
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,784
And to answer your question,

17
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:35,035
the shifting point of view

18
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,787
grants the reader

19
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,787
a broader perspective

20
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:39,748
of events than typically allowed

21
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:39,748
by first-person narration.

22
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,626
Where were we?

23
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:46,087
And "ergo" is Latin for "hence,"

24
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:46,087
Derek.

Hey, there's

33
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,238
my favorite patient!

34
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,407
What hurts today?

35
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,616
Tummy troubles.

Oh, no. Sorry to hear it.

37
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,245
Let me grab your file.

<i>close calls...</i>

43
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,294
This is just a blister.

44
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,671
Are you sure?

45
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:30,674
Sheldon, I promise

46
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:30,674
you don't have leprosy.

47
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,594
Ooh, that's bright.

48
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,263
Proving you don't have

49
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,263
hysterical blindness.

50
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,097
Well, can you test

51
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,097
for just hysterical?

52
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,435
Oh. Looks like

53
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,435
you bit your cheek.

54
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,938
How do you know it's not scurvy?

55
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,522
Because you're not a pirate.

56
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,816
So, we've got

57
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,816
a tummyache?

58
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,652
Yes. I'm afraid

59
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,652
it might be cholera.

60
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:51,820
Again?

61
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,864
I have one of the symptoms.

62
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,658
Okay, on a scale of one to ten,

63
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,658
what's your pain level?

64
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,702
Three...

65
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,746
point four seven.

66
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,081
That's pretty serious.

67
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:06,334
But since you're at a 3.47,

68
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,795
I'm gonna give you

69
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,795
the strongest medication

70
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:11,882
I'm allowed to give you.

71
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:14,301
You're an angel

72
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:14,301
of mercy, Nurse Nora.

73
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,512
Ooh, cherry.

74
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,268
(phone ringing)

75
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,519
Hello?

76
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,563
Oh. Hey, Nora.

77
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,565
What is it this time?

78
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,150
(scoffs)

79
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,402
Okay, yeah,

80
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,402
thanks for lettin' me know.

81
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:35,030
I'll keep an eye on him.

82
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,074
Sheldon back in

83
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,074
the nurse's office?

84
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:37,950
Yep.

85
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:39,493
Let me guess.

86
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,662
Yellow fever. Dengue fever.

87
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,914
Cat scratch fever.

88
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,457
Cholera.

89
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,793
Ooh! I was gonna say cholera.

90
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,670
(both laughing)

91
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,170
A quadrilateral

92
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,090
that can be inscribed

93
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,090
in a circle

94
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,134
is an example of

95
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,134
a cyclic polygon.

96
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,844
(groans)

97
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,597
Sheldon, don't argue with me,

98
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,597
I'm looking at it right here.

<i>questionable math skills</i>

107
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,733
<i>certainly weren't helping.</i>

111
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,450
(groans softly)

112
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,369
You're gonna be fine.

113
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,663
One good dump

114
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,663
and you'll feel right as rain.

115
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,874
Can you please not call it that?

116
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,000
What, "dump"?

117
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,126
Yes.

118
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,460
You want me to say "poop"?

119
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,671
I want you to stop

120
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,671
talking about it.

121
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,464
B.M.?

122
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,257
Dad!

123
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,968
Where is he?

124
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,219
He's fine.

125
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,679
He's in the bathroom

126
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,679
workin' it out.

127
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,807
Shelly, you okay in there?

128
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,142
SHELDON:

129
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,142
No.

130
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,685
Give it a few more minutes!

131
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:47,936
Eyes on the prize!

132
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,564
SHELDON:

133
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,564
This is not a fecal issue!

134
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,107
I'm coming in.

135
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,984
SHELDON:

136
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,984
My tummy really hurts, Mom.

137
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,360
MARY:

138
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,360
You do feel a bit warm.

139
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,278
Okay, you finish

140
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,278
up in here,

141
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,906
get in bed, and I'll

142
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,906
bring you some ginger ale.

143
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,407

144
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,407
Canada Dry?

MARY: Yes.

146
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,242
SHELDON: Room temperature?

147
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,536
MARY: Yes.

148
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,536
SHELDON: Mostly flat?

149
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,287
I'll stir the fizz out

150
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,287
with a spoon.

151
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,372
SHELDON:

152
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,372
Thanks, Mom.

153
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,416
(sighs)

154
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,709
Why don't you dote

155
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,709
on me like that?

156
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,794
Because he's my baby.

157
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,546
Well, I could be your baby.

158
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,757
Oh, now I have a stomachache.

159
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,302
How you feelin', baby?

160
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,431
Remember the tuna sandwich

161
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,431
I had at the bus station?

162
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,390
Yeah?

163
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,808
Worse than that.

164
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,603
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

165
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,688
I'm sure you'll feel

166
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,688
better in the morning.

167
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,816
Hey, Mom, you know how twins

168
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,816
can feel each other's pain?

169
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,443
You're going to

170
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,443
school tomorrow.

171
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,987
I think she's gettin' smarter.

172
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,489
(TV droning quietly)

173
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:46,078
Relax, he's sleeping.

174
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,580
How come when I'm sick

175
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,580
it's no big deal,

176
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,873
but when Sheldon gets sick

177
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,208
you act like

178
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,208
it's the end of the world?

179
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,419
Because he's

180
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,419
a fragile little boy

181
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,880
and you're gettin' to be

182
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,880
a big, strong man.

183
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,298
That's true.

184
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,508
Puberty has done right by me.

185
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,971
Mom? Something's really

186
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,971
wrong with Sheldon.

187
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,477
We need a doctor here!

188
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,477
(Sheldon groans)

189
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,395
ADULT SHELDON:<i> In that moment,</i>

190
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,395

00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,284
So how's he doing?

196
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,661
Aw, poor little guy.

197
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,789
All right, well,

198
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,789
if there's anything you need,

199
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,707
let me know.

200
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,293
I love you, too.

201
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,795
Well?

202
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,797
Your brother's gonna be fine,

203
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,882
but he has to have

204
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,882
his gallbladder removed.

205
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,341
How's he gonna pee?

206
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,261
Not that bladder,

207
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,261
his gallbladder.

208
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,804
What's the gallbladder do?

209
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,140
I guess not much,

210
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,140
if they're takin' it out.

211
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,017
You think he'll bring it home

212
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,017
so we can see it?

213
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,895
I'll ask.

214
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,445
Oh, I feel terrible.

215
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,823
How was I supposed to know

216
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,823
it was his gallbladder?

217
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,408
The doctor says

218
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,408
it's rare in children.

219
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,912
Well, he's always complaining

220
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,912
about some health issue

221
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,331
and it... it's usually nothin'.

222
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,999
I know, George.

223
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,335
I mean, how many times...

224
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,376
I'm prayin' here!

225
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,420
Right, sorry. Sorry.

226
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,630
(beeping steadily)

227
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,262
So, those pain meds should

228
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,262
already be kicking in.

229
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,722
Then my buddy Gary here

230
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,225
is gonna administer the gas,

231
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,225
which'll help you sleep.

232
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,727
And once you're under,

233
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,727
we'll make a little incision

234
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,021
and snatch that guy

235
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,021
right outta there.

236
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,064
Any questions?

237
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,606
Yes.

238
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,150
What kind of doctor says,

239
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,485
"Snatch that guy

240
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,485
right out of there?"

241
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,071
Just trying to put you at ease.

242
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,530
It didn't work.

243
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,615
Where did you go

244
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,615
to medical school?

245
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,117
University of Nebraska.

246
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,577
Uh-oh.

247
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,372
Did you at least graduate

248
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,372
with honors?

249
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,413
Top of my class.

250
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,833
Have you had any alcohol

251
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,252
in the last 24 hours?

252
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,502
Not a drop.

253
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,129
How much sleep

254
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,129
did you get last...

255
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,757
Gary, can we...

256
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,757
Got it.

257
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:07,635
Just relax and start counting

258
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:07,635
backwards from 100.

259
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,929
Wait, Gary...

260
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,099
Where did you study

261
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,099
anesthesiolo...

262
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,603
(dramatic music playing)

263
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,355
Hard to port!

264
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,565
Aye aye, Captain Ahab.

265
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,446
Thar she blows!

266
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,448
Gallbladder dead ahead!

267
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:31,576
(whale vocalizing)

268
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,620
Captain Ahab,

269
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,620
are you hungry?

270
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,122
Do you want

271
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,122
a bowl of gruel?

272
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:39,042
Not now, Mom, I'm in pursuit

273
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:39,042
of my inner demons.

274
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,920
Aye, she's a

275
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,920
formidable organ.

276
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,671
Just looks like a whale.

277
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,549
It's a metaphor, doofus.

278
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,926
ALL:

279
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,926
Arrr!

280
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,054
Sweet dreams, honey.

281
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,973
I'll try.

282
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,434
Your brother's gonna be

283
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,434
just fine.

284
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,978
Yeah, I know.

285
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,687
I'll tell you what.

286
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:04,109
If I hear any news,

287
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:04,109
I will come and wake you up.

288
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,987
Thank you.

289
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,241
Night night.

290
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,600
(sighs)

291
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,148
This is ridiculous.

292
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,401
They said an hour and a half;

293
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,401
it's been almost two.

294
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,944
I'm gonna go yell at somebody.

295
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,696
Good. Yell

296
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,696
at everybody.

297
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,657
Uhp, ah,

298
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,657
y'all can exhale.

299
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,908
Surgery went great.

300
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,494
Thank you, Jesus.

301
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,496
Sheldon's gonna need

302
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,496
to stay here three, four days,

303
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,830
which is standard,

304
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,290
but, uh, after that

305
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,290
he's good to go home.

306
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,043
Really appreciate it, Doctor.

307
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,043
Oh. (chuckles)

308
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,337
We can't thank you enough

309
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,337
for takin' care of him.

310
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,297
He's extremely intelligent,

311
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,297
isn't he?

312
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,298
Oh, yeah.

313
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,758
He's our special little boy.

314
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,180
(exhales)

315
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,180
Oh.

316
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,849
Are you ready

317
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,849
to see your family?

318
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,309
Yes.

319
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,102
That's good, 'cause

320
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,102
they're ready to see you.

321
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,229
Okay.

322
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,398
There he is, there's my baby.

323
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,400
(chuckles): Hey, buddy.

324
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,400
How you feeling?

325
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,984
I brought you

326
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,984
some comic books.

327
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:31,029
Hi, Moonpie.

328
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:31,029
Hi, Meemaw.

329

MISSY:

330
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,155
Where's your gallbladder?

331
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,240
I want to see it.

332
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,741
They throw it away, honey.

333
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,326
Why?

334
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,326
(groans)

335
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,994
Can I go home now?

336
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,580
No, baby, they need

337
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,580
to keep you here

338
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,499
a little while,

339
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,499
make sure you're okay.

340
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,791
Overnight?

341
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,460
Actually, a...

342
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,379
few nights.

343
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,589
No, tell them I'm going home.

344
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,050
Shelly, the doctors know

345
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,050
what's best for you.

is to be at home, in my own bed,

349

with my books and my computer.

350
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,099
Well, I can bring you whatever

351
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,099
you want. Just-just tell me.

352
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,351
I just told you: bring me home.

353
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:04,062
Moonpie, you're looking

354
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:04,062
at this all wrong.

355
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,399
You got your own room here,

356
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,399
your own TV.

357
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:11,319
Is no one listening to me?

358
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:11,319
I want to go home.

359
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,030
I'm listening, but I

360
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,030
have no say in this.

Now all I can taste is towel.

387
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:58,283
♪ Not me... ♪

388
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,201
And pulp.

389
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,911
♪ Not me. ♪

390
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,580
(beeping)

391
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:06,416
Ugh, man, it's Cooper again.

392
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,084
Can you take it?

393
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:11,505
Do I have to? He asked me if all

394
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:11,505
the jobs for men were taken.

395
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:15,509
I'll get it. You just stay here

396
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:15,509
and do your nails.

397
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,926
(sighs)

398
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,303
What?

399
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,514
Do you know where my mother is?

400
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,474
I think she went down to

401
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,474
the cafeteria. What do you need?

402
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:23,808
I can't sleep.

403
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,059
Did you try counting sheep?

404
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,312
Oh, no, I'm afraid

405
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,312
of farm animals.

406
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:30,524
Of course you are. Well, I don't

407
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:30,524
know what I can do for you.

408
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,526
Do you know

409
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,526
the "Soft Kitty" song?

410
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,027
No.

411
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,321
I'll teach it to you.

412
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,321
Get a notepad.

413
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,699
Okay.

414
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,744
I got your pillow

415
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,744
and your blanket.

416
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,497
(grunts)

417
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,834
Shelly, what do you say?

418
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,587
Why does it smell like Missy?

419
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,007
You're doing great, honey.

420
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,596
What's going on?

421
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,890
This is Ricky,

422
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,890
your new roommate.

423
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,809
Nice to meet you.

424
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,690
I am so sorry.

425
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,323
It's just for one night.

426
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,991
They said

427
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,991
you going home tomorrow.

428
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,951
They also said

429
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,951
I'd have my own room.

430
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,704
He better not be contagious.

431
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,706
He's not.

432
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,706
Are you sure?

433
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,332
Should we ask his doctor?

434
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,710
You just asked me and I said no.

435
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,546
But you're not a doctor.

436
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,546
Your career stalled at nurse.

437
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:37,382
Okay, listen.

438
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:41,802
I done put up with your nonsense

439
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:41,802
long enough, and it ends now.

440
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,431
That boy is your roommate,

441
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:48,226
that's the situation and you

442
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:48,226
gonna make the best of it.

443
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,977
You get my drift?

444
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,234
(TV droning quietly)

445
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,654
So Sheldon comes home tomorrow?

446
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,155
Yep.

447
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,075
Everybody's thinking it,

448
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,075
so I'm gonna say it.

449
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,244
This has been a nice break.

450
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,414
Hey. Don't talk about

451
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,414
your brother like that.

452
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,249
Since when are you on his side?

453
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,084
Since Dad almost let him die.

454
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,339
No!

455
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,339
SHELDON: Unbelievable.

456
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,301
It's either cartoons

457
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,301
or men in their underwear

458
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,094
banging their heads together.

459
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,097
RICKY:

460
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,097
You complain a lot.

461
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,016
Excuse me?

462
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:33,146
Seriously, dude,

463
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:33,146
you need to relax.

464
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,606
How can I relax?

465
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,609
I'm being held captive

466
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,609
in a bacterial playground.

467
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,653
Why are you here?

468
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,530
I had to have my gallbladder

469
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,530
removed. Why are you here?

470
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,240
I'm having surgery tomorrow.

471
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,784
How come?

472
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,786
I was born with a hole

473
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,786
in my heart.

474
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:50,871
My mom says everyone is born

475
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:50,871
with a Jesus-shaped hole

476
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,458
in their heart, but I'm guessing

477
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,458
this is different.

478
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,127
Yeah, they're gonna

479
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,127
put a patch on it.

480
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,004
And then it just

481
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,004
stays there forever?

482
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,466
Yeah, like a Band-Aid

483
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,466
you never have to pull off.

484
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,302
That's great, because that's

485
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,302
the worst thing about Band-Aids.

486
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,595
(laughs softly)

487
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:06,929
They may have removed

488
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:06,929
my gallbladder,

489
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,182
but not my wicked sense

490
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,182
of humor.

491
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,357
Whatcha working on?

492
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,983
A welcome home sign for Sheldon.

493
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,361
Oh, that's a nice thing.

494
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,988
Yeah, but this "W"

495
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,988
took me half an hour.

496
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,906
Hmm. You want some help?

497
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:26,991
Yeah.

498
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:30,244
Georgie, get your ass in here!

499
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,831
How did you find out you have

500
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,831
a hole in your heart?

501
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,708
I fainted playing soccer.

502
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,544
Hmm, I guess I'm fortunate.

503
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,544
Why?

504
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,879
I don't and never will

505
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,879
play soccer.

506
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,549
How did you know something was

507
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,549
wrong with your gallbladder?

508
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,258
It started

509
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,258
as a minor tummyache,

510
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,969
then escalated

511
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,969
to a major tummyache.

512
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,013
Luckily, I handle pain well.

513
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,061
(quietly): What are you gonna

514
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,061
do when you get home?

515
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,523
Enjoy a bathroom

516
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,523
I can relax in.

517
00:14:58,565 --> 00:14:59,816
Although I do like that there's

518
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:02,109
a big red emergency button

519
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:02,109
in there.

520
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,529
I actually don't mind it here.

521
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,656
What about the food?

522
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:10,201
It's not as good as my grandma's

523
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:10,201
tamales, but nothing is.

524
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,370
How long has she been

525
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,370
taking care of you?

526
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,872
My whole life.

527
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,541
She'd be here,

528
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,541
but she's watching my brother.

529
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:20,670
My meemaw takes care of us

530
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:20,670
sometimes, too.

531
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:24,298
I'm excited for my heart

532
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:24,298
to be fixed, 'cause then,

533
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,885
she won't have to worry

534
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,885
about me anymore. But hey,

535
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,887
once they put

536
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,887
the patch on my heart,

537
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,180
I'll sort of be like Iron Man.

538
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:34,851
Technically, Iron Man has

539
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:34,851
a magnet, not a patch.

540
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,936
And technically,

541
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,936
I said "sort of."

542
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,897
Touché.

543
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,483
(grunts softly)

544
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,074
Where'd he go? Where's Ricky?

545
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,243
He's in surgery.

546
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,621
Oh.

547
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,205
But look what I'm doing.

548
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,583
I'm packing up so

549
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,583
we can go home.

550
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,959
Can we wait until he's done?

551
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,211
I think it's gonna

552
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,211
be a while, honey,

553
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,171
but why don't we get a move on

554
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,882
and then we can

555
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,882
check on him later?

556
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,386
Okay.

557
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,059
One second.

558
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,186
Excuse me, Nurse Robinson?

559
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,690
Yes?

560
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,690
Will you give this

561
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,690
Iron Man comic to Ricky?

562
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,400
I'll see that he gets it.

563
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,736
Thank you.

564
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,736
Mm-hmm.

565
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:29,405
And thank you

566
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:29,405
for taking care of me.

567
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,282
(chuckles):

568
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,282
You're welcome.

569
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,742
You stay healthy.

570
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,327
I will.

571
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,872
When did he become nice?

572
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,040
(elevator chimes)

573
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,177
Uh, I'll get the next one.

574
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,405
I actually missed you.

575
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:13,491
Ain't that nice?

576
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,367
What about me did you miss?

577
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,703
I don't know.

578
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,204
Well, think about it

579
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,204
and get back to me.

580
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:20,580
Ha, he gave you homework.

581
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,541
Sheldon, I just got off

582
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,541
the phone with that nurse

583
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,960
from the hospital.

584
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,712
Your little roommate's

585
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,712
gonna be just fine.

586
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:27,380
Oh, good. That's a relief.

587
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,840
Would you like to go visit him?

588
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,467
No. Why?

589
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,889
Okay, here we go, Sheldon.

590
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:41,435
One "precision astronomical

591
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:41,435
refractor telescope."

592
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,270
Wow. Thanks, Dad.

593
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,732
ADULT SHELDON:<i> For the next few</i>

594
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,732
<i>weeks, my guilt-ridden father</i>

595
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,026
<i>continued to lavish me</i>

596
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,026
<i>with gifts.</i>

597
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,445
<i>Then the football playoffs</i>

598
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,445
<i>started and that was that.</i>

599
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,823
Time's up.

600
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,823
What did you miss about me?

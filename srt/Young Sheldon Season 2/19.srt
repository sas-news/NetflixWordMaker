1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:04,546
ADULT SHELDON:

2
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:04,546
<i>Not all science</i>

3
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:04,546
<i>is created equal.</i>

4
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,591
<i>There's physics,</i>

5
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,591
<i>the undisputed king of science.</i>

6
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,384
<i>There's chemistry.</i>

7
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,384
<i>It's no physics,</i>

8
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:12,053
<i>but it's not a bad way</i>

9
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:12,053
<i>to pass a rainy afternoon.</i>

10
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,389
<i>And then there's biology,</i>

11
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,183
<i>the squishiest of the sciences.</i>

12
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:17,601
<i>Ugh!</i>

13
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,562
Once you have deposited

14
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,562
enough saliva

15
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:21,689
in the blue

16
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:21,689
Benedict's solution,

17
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,983
we'll mix it

18
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,484
in the centrifuge.

19
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,444
After that, we'll pass it

20
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,444
through the spectrometer

21
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:30,197
to measure

22
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:30,197
how much glucose is present.

23
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,491
And won't that be a party?

24
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,659
Sheldon.

25
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,460
(whirring)

26
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,921
(hissing, clanging)

27
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,386
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

28
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,346
It's warm. Oh, dear.

29
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,517
♪ Nobody else

30
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,517

31
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,311

35
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,493
And then there was some

36
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,493
extra money in the budget,

37
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,412
so I was able to order

38
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,412
those tackling dummies

39
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,788
I had my eye on.

40
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,916
I don't understand

41
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,916
why the football program gets

42
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,959
so much money, while

43
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,959
the equipment in the science lab

44
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,878
is outdated and falling apart.

45
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,086
Oh, I can explain that.

46
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,213
This is Texas.

47
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,339
Pass the ribs.

48
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,298
Well, it's not fair.

49
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,466
It's a school.

50
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,052
Education should be

51
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,052
their priority.

52
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,595
All right, I'll

53
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,595
explain it again...

54
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,095
MEEMAW: I think

55
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,095
Shelly's got a point.

56
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,348
The school is supposed

57
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,348
to prepare these kids

58
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,850
for the future.

59
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,850
How many of 'em

60
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:42,185
are gonna be

61
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:42,185
professional football players?

62
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,896
No one at this table.

63
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,440
But how many of 'em

64
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,440
are gonna be scientists?

65
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,775
I know.

66
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,485
George, isn't there

67
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,485
a way they can take some

68
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,362
of the football money

69
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,362
and spend it on science?

70
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,782
Really?

71
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,782
I need to explain it again?

72
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,784
You know, Moon Pie, in the '60s,

73
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,784
when the hippies wanted

74
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,244
to change things,

75
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,244
they would just protest.

76
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,080
You were a hippie?

77
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,080
Oh, no.

78
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,498
But I wrote a letter

79
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,498
complaining about the hippies,

80
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,834
and the police chased 'em

81
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,834
right out of that park.

82
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,210
So my point is...

83
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,128
maybe you could write a letter.

84
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,548
Ooh! Maybe I can lodge

85
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,548
a formal complaint

86
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,009
with the school board about

87
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,009
the sports budget infringing

88
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,260
on the other departments.

89
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,303
Okay, last time:

90
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,013
Canada,

91
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,640
the other states,

92
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,558
us.

93
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,228
(indistinct chatter)

94
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,024
(shouts)

95
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,024
(shouts)

96
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,151
What are you doing,

97
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,151
standing there?

98
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,445
I wrote a formal complaint

99
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,445
letter to the school board

100
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,447
on how much money is

101
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,447
spent on football.

102
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,616
I was hoping you could

103
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,616
deliver it to them.

104
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,785
You do realize

105
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,785
your father's a coach here.

106
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,244
Yes, sir, I do.

107
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,955
Maybe you ought to talk to him

108
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,955
about this first.

109
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,123
I did.

110
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,000
He didn't care

111
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,000
for the idea at all.

112
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,335
Well, there you go.

113
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,337
There I go what?

114
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,007
Let me see that.

115
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,758
(sighs)

116
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,012
"Barbaric sport...

117
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,012
encourages bloodlust similar

118
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,847
"to Roman gladiator

119
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,847

120
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,765
"Christians, lions...

121
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,267
money better spent

122
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,267
on science and learning."

123
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,145
You're joking, right?

124
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,981
Did you see the word "bazinga"

125
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,981
anywhere in that letter?

126
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:13,986
Out.

127
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:17,114
I'll just have to go

128
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:17,114
over his head.

129
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,243
President Cooper.

130
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,245
That's serendipitous.

131
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,832
Hello.

132
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:27,958
(gasps)

133
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:27,958
(shouts)

134
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,584
What?

135
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,337
I understand that you're

136
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,337
in charge of student elections.

137
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,755
(exhales)

138
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,007
I am.

139
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,217
I'd like to run

140
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,217
for class president.

141
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,886
Really?

142
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,387
Really.

143
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,222
Okay.

144
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,017
You can sign up,

145
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,017
but I have to warn you--

146
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,853
you'll be running

147
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,853
against Nell Cavanaugh.

148
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,063
So?

149
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,398
She's well-liked

150
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,398
by the student body.

151
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,983
So?

152
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:56,195
These elections tend to be a

153
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:56,195
bit of a popularity contest.

154
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,239
So?

155
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,239
You're gonna make

156
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,239
me say it, huh?

157
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,407
Say what?

158
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,409
People don't like you.

159
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,120
Well, as my meemaw likes to say,

160
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,120
water off a duck's back.

161
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,330
Elections shouldn't be

162
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,330
about popularity.

163
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,708
They should be about who has

164
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,708
the best ideas.

165
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,169
And what's your idea?

166
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,587
Less money on football,

167
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,130
more on science.

168
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,050
Really.

169
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,635
Guess what. I'm running

170
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,635
for class president.

171
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,221
Good for you.

172
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,805
You're encouraging him?

173
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,599
He's gonna get destroyed.

174
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,017
You don't know that.

175
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,769
I feel like I do.

176
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,562
Well, whether you win or not,

177
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,606
I think it's great

178
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,606
that you're trying.

179
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,691
But you think I'll win, right?

180
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,987
God's listening, Mom.

181
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,115
I think it's

182
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,115
certainly possible.

183
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,075
Do you have a campaign strategy?

184
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:44,034
No.

185
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,535
Do you have a catchy slogan?

186
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,578
No.

187
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,955
Does he have a shot at winning?

188
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,081
No.

189
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,628
Hello, I'd like to speak

190
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,628
to the mayor, please.

191
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,754
My name is Sheldon Cooper.

192
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,131
I'm running for class president

193
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:00,383
and was hoping

194
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:00,383
he could give me some advice.

195
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,676
I'm ten years old.

196
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,220
But if it helps get him

197
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,220
on the phone,

198
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,388
I'm well-behaved,

199
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,388
a straight-A student,

200
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,474
and have impeccable hygiene.

201
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,809
(beep)

202
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,809
Hello.

203
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,310
This is Mayor Harrison.

204
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,063
I understand

205
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,063
you are running for office.

206
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,397
Class president.

207
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,441
Do you have any advice

208
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,441
on how to win?

209
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,693
The most important thing

210
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,693
is to get out there

211
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,279
and connect with people.

212
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,738
That's tricky.

213
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,490
I'm not terribly fond of people.

214
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,826
Well, you might need

215
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,826
to get over that.

216
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,077
Assuming I can,

217
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,536
how do I connect with them?

218
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,831
A friendly handshake

219
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,831
is a great start.

220
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,915
Oh, boy.

221
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,625
Now I have to touch them?

222
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,794
ADULT SHELDON:

223
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,794
<i>Over the next few days,</i>

224
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,838
<i>I mounted my campaign.</i>

225
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,632
My name is Sheldon Cooper, and

226
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,632
I'm running for class president.

227
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,842
Okay.

228
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,802
Put her there.

229
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,721
Greetings, fellow students.

230
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,556
I'm running for class president.

231
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,892
Here's a button.

232
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,520
Have a grown-up put them on you.

233
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,980
They're sharp.

234
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,148
Hello.

235
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,398
I'm Sheldon Cooper,

236
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,900
and I'm running

237
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,900
for class president.

238
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,359
Yeah?

239
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,359
I understand

240
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,695
you had a baby last year.

241
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,072
If you bring it in,

242
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,072
I'll try to kiss it.

243
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,663
Vote Sheldon

244
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,663
for class president.

245
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,082
Vote Sheldon

246
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,082
for class president.

247
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:17,336
Vote Sheldon for

248
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:17,336
class president.

249
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,338
Don't worry--

250
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,338
it's a number two.

251
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,131
You can use it on

252
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,131
standardized tests.

253
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,590
Okay.

254
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,884
And, of course, homework.

255
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,177
I love homework.

256
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,637
Well, it's so nice

257
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,637
to finally meet you.

258
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,638
I'm Nell Cavanaugh.

259
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,265
My opponent.

260
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:33,018
I would shake your hand, but

261
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:33,018
my mom is washing my mittens.

262
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,936
Okay.

263
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,563
(chuckles)

264
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,939
She was really nice.

265
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,067
She even said, "May

266
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,067
the best student win."

267
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,235
That's sweet.

268
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,861
This was a great idea.

269
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,364
Children like cupcakes,

270
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,364
and, by giving them cupcakes,

271
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,448
they'll transfer

272
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,448
that affinity to me.

273
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,702
That's another way

274
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,702
of looking at it.

275
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,663
By that reasoning, a rich person

276
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,663
could simply buy people's votes.

277
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,540
It's been known to happen.

278
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:56,750
Until my ship comes in,

279
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,501
I guess it's cupcakes.

280
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,837
Georgie, check it out.

281
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,964
Oh, man, I hate

282
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,964
that he's doing this.

283
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,716
What? It's cute.

284
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,926
It's embarrassing.

285
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,303
I would think

286
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,303
you'd be proud of him.

287
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,805
That's 'cause you're

288
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,805
a better person than me.

289
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,516
Maybe you ought to ask God

290
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,516
to take away your anger

291
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,976
and replace it with love.

292
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,396
Can I ask him to take away

293
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,396
my brother instead?

294
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,688
Georgie.

295
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,274
Not kill him--

296
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,525
just strand him

297
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,525
on an island somewhere.

298
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,444
A nice island,

299
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,363
with coconuts and stuff.

300
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,699
(indistinct chatter)

301
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,163
(chuckling)

302
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,339
Nell Cavanaugh,

303
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,801
it appears

304
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,801
we're taking the mittens off.

305
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,220
Well, that's unfortunate.

306
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,972
Oh, this goes

307
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,972
well beyond unfortunate.

308
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,390
It's flat-out unfair.

309
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,892
Did you not say that

310
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,892
you love homework?

311
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,936
Of course I said it.

312
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,936
I say it all the time.

313
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,897
But she took it out of context

314
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,897
and is using it against me.

315
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,941
Well, that is what

316
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,941
happens in politics.

317
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,525
People stretch the truth.

318
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,445
Well, those people

319
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,445
are dirty dogs.

320
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,570
They certainly are.

321
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,530
Now, let me ask you something.

322
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,699
How bad do you want

323
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,699
to win this election?

324
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,786
Bad enough to let

325
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,786
105 kids shake my mitten.

326
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,204
Okay, then you need

327
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,204
to toughen up.

328
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,457
Politics is not

329
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,457
for the weak-kneed.

330
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,792
Are you suggesting

331
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,792
that I fight fire with fire?

332
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,543
I am.

333
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,964
So going to my room and crying

334
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,964
in my pillow is not an option?

335
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,341
It is not.

336
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,928
Then I have some thinking to do.

337
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:34,722
MISSY:

338
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:34,722
Oh, yeah.

339
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,932
You're screwed.

340
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,725
Which is why I

341
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,725
need your help.

342
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,934
Why me?

343
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,102
You're ruthless.

344
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,438
I've seen you cheat

345
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,438
at Candy Land.

346
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,773
Thanks. Go on.

347
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:44,983
Well, I'd like to retaliate,

348
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,651
but I don't know

349
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,651
anything about her.

350
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,362
Make something up.

351
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,905
Ooh, tell people

352
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,905
she has head lice.

353
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,866
I won't resort to lying.

354
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,161
There's a Denise Cavanaugh

355
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,161
in my class.

356
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,371
Could be her little sister.

357
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,705
So?

358
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,290
I'll see if I can dig up

359
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,290
something about Nell

360
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:01,708
you can use against her.

361
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,293
Thank you.

362
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,920
Georgie, I hate

363
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,920
to have to ask this,

364
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,881
but are you going

365
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,881
to vote for me?

366
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,090
No. Go away.

367
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,384
Are you sure?

368
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,386
If I win, I can make

369
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,386
you a hall monitor.

370
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,637
Imagine the respect

371
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,637
you'll get then.

372
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,515
Get lost.

373
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:26,191
GEORGE JR.:

374
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:26,191
<i>Lord, please take away my anger</i>

375
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:26,191
<i>toward my stupid brother.</i>

376
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,817
<i>My life is hard enough.</i>

377
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,528
<i>Don't let him be president.</i>

378
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,363
<i>And while we're talking,</i>

379
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,532
<i>Veronica-- help me out.</i>

380
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,826
<i>Encourage her to do something</i>

381
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,826
<i>with me she'll regret.</i>

382
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,245
<i>Amen.</i>

383
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,247
(school bell rings)

384
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,998
Remember,

385
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,667
tomorrow

386
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,667
we'll be dissecting worms!

387
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,127
(groaning)

388
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:49,214
Ah, your sadness makes me happy.

389
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,631
Mr. Givens,

390
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,631
I just wanted you to know

391
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,467
that I'm still working hard

392
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,467
on my campaign

393
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,719
to get more funding

394
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,719
for the science department.

395
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,139
Oh, great, 'cause I've got to

396
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,139
dig up tomorrow's worms myself.

397
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,683
Anything you can do to help

398
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,683
me win a decisive victory

399
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,685
come Election Day

400
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,685
would be much appreciated.

401
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,271
Oh, well, I'm sorry, Sheldon,

402
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,314
the faculty doesn't get involved

403
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,314
in student elections.

404
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,275
Oh, I understand.

405
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,569
You have to remain neutral.

406
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,569
Wink, wink.

407
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,904
I'm sorry, wink, wink?

408
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,490
You want new science equipment

409
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,490
and I want that for you.

410
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,368
One hand washes the other.

411
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,368
Wink, wink.

412
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,079
Oh, sure, wink, wink.

413
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,915
Now you're getting it.

414
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,915
Wink, wink.

415
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,000
Wink, wink.

416
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,127
Wink, wink.

417
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,796
(sighs)

418
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,796
That kid creeps me out.

419
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:33,091
ADULT SHELDON:

420
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:33,091
<i>Another hurdle in my political</i>

421
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:33,091
<i>career was glossophobia:</i>

422
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,842
<i>fear of public speaking.</i>

423
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,887
<i>I've been known to experience</i>

424
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,887
<i>dry mouth, perspiration,</i>

425
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,223
<i>heart palpitations,</i>

426
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,223
<i>and fainting.</i>

427
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,891
<i>A similar response</i>

428
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,891
<i>to what I experience</i>

429
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,477
<i>around unleashed dogs.</i>

430
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,477
(line ringing)

431
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,562
Hello, this is Sheldon Cooper.

432
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,481
Can I please speak

433
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,481
with Pastor Jeff?

434
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:50,525
PEG (over phone):

435
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:50,525
Hold on. (coughing)

436
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,528
Hey, Sheldon,

437
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,528
what can I do for you?

438
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,572
I need to give

439
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,572
a speech at school,

440
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,491
but I have a fear

441
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,491
of public speaking.

442
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,284
Since you give a sermon

443
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,284
every Sunday,

444
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,244
I was hoping you'd have

445
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,244
some words of advice.

446
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,746
As a matter of fact, I do.

447
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:07,125
When I look down on my

448
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:07,125
congregation and I feel nervous,

449
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,128
I just ask the Lord

450
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,128
to speak through me.

451
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,130
Like a ventriloquist?

452
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,632
Not exactly.

453
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,300
I think of it more as a...

454
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:16,510
Like one of the Muppets?

455
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,844
No, not that either.

456
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,929
'Cause you do look

457
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,929
a little like Kermit.

458
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,390
Uh, okay, good luck to you,

459
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,390
Sheldon.

460
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,309
Hello.

461
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,645
Dr. Sturgis.

462
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,645
Can you give me any advice

463
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,813
on how to overcome a fear

464
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,813
of public speaking?

465
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,650
Ah, you know,

466
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,650
when I was a young man

467
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,445
I had a terrible fear

468
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,445
of speaking to an audience.

469
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,071
What did you do?

470
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,407
Actually, it kinda took care

471
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,407
of itself.

472
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:43,161
One day I was, uh,

473
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:43,161
playing miniature golf

474
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,956
with some colleagues

475
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,956
and I got struck by lightning.

476
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,000
Oh, dear.

477
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,000
No, it was fine.

478
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:53,630
When I came to, I found myself

479
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:53,630
with the gift of gab.

480
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:54,922
Big crowds,

481
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,592
small crowds,

482
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,592
you couldn't shut me up.

483
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,553
I don't see how

484
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,553
that can benefit me.

485
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:02,263
Not unless you'd like me

486
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:02,263
to take you miniature golfing

487
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,974
next time there are clouds

488
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,974
on the horizon.

489
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,943
Everything okay?

490
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,943
No.

491
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,905
I have to give a speech

492
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,905
in front of the entire assembly.

493
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,575
Oh. Got a little stage fright?

494
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,284
Unfortunately so.

495
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,287
Just thinking about it

496
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,287
causes my bladder to misbehave.

497
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,582
(chuckles) Yeah, I been there.

498
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,208
You have?

499
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,834
Sure.

500
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,294
When I first started coaching,

501
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,046
I was real nervous

502
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,046
to talk to the team,

503
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,631
you know,

504
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,631
give a locker room speech.

505
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,758
Then, one day

506
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,758
it dawned on me,

507
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,219
I'm not just talking

508
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,219
to football players,

509
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,638
I'm talking

510
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,638
to teenage football players.

511
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,806
Most of them aren't listening

512
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,806
to a word I'm saying.

513
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,808
That's an interesting

514
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,808
perspective.

515
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,644
I'll tell you

516
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,644
something else.

517
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,105
You don't give yourself enough

518
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,105
credit for how brave you are.

519
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,441
I don't?

520
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,441
No.

521
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,569
Sheldon, you are ten years old,

522
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,569
going to high school.

523
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:00,821
Everyone's older than you,

524
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:00,821
everyone's bigger than you,

525
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,951
but you keep at it,

526
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,951
day after day.

527
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,328
That's brave.

528
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,330
Any kid who can do that

529
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,330
could give a speech

530
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,250
to the United Nations

531
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,250
if he had to.

532
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,545
Thanks, Dad.

533
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,765
I heard what you

534
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,765
said in there.

535
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,975
That was very

536
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,975
beautiful.

537
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,975
Thanks.

538
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,894
I gave a similar speech

539
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,894
to my team last week.

540
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,896
Boy, did we get

541
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,896
our asses kicked.

542
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,235
ADULT SHELDON:<i> Emboldened</i>

543
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,235
<i>by my father's pep talk,</i>

544
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,570
<i>I began working on my speech.</i>

545
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,197
<i>I aspired to walk</i>

546
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,197

549
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,996
<i>and, last but not least,</i>

550
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,996
<i>Professor Proton.</i>

551
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,748
Hey, I spoke to Nell's sister.

552
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,541
Found out some

553
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,541
interesting stuff.

554
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:57,003
Thanks, but I've decided I don't

555
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:57,003
want to stoop to her level.

556
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,172
If I can't win on the quality

557
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,172
of my ideas,

558
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,424
then I'd rather lose

559
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,424
with my head held high.

560
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,801
That's really stupid,

561
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,428
but in case you change

562
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,428
your mind...

563
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,350
All right, y'all have heard

564
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,811
from your secretary candidates,

565
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,811
your treasurer candidates,

566
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,062
your vice presidents...

567
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,064
It's time for the big finale,

568
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,652
the closing event,

569
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,652
the headliners...

570
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:24,155
Nell Cavanaugh

571
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:24,155
and Sheldon Cooper.

572
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,074
One of these two will be

573
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,074
president of your class,

574
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,077
so listen to what they've got

575
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,077
to say and choose wisely,

576
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,080
which will be a whole new

577
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,080
experience for most of you.

578
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,209
Remember, heckling

579
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,209
will get you detention.

580
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,335
STUDENT:

581
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,335

Bryan Larkin, two days!

584
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,549
You want to try for a week?

585
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,634
I didn't think so.

586
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,594
Nell, floor is yours.

587
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,055
(cheering and applause)

588
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,603

00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,603
Nell!

590
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,855
(whooping)

591
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,939
Thank you, Ms. MacElroy,

592
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,526
Principal Petersen,

593
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,526
our hard-working teachers,

594
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:02,943
and my fellow students.

595
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,447
I'm blessed to call

596
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,447
so many of you friends.

597
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,241
Y'all probably know everything

598
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,241
about me already.

599
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,950
Lord knows I love to talk.

600
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,950

(laughter)

602
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,581
So instead of going on

603
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,581
about myself,

604
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,709
I'd like to talk to you

605
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,709
about my opponent.

606
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,294
Sheldon Cooper has been lobbying

607
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,921
for new science equipment here

608
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,921
at Medford High,

609
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:25,717
and while that sounds wonderful,

610
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:25,717
the truth is,

611
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:31,013
he thinks our school wastes

612
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:31,013
its money on football.

613
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,767
(students booing)

614
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,143
Do we really want

615
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,143
a class president

616
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,021
who doesn't care about football?

617
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,775
STUDENTS:

618
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,775
No!

619
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,860
I know I am proud to be

620
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,860
a Medford High cheerleader,

621
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,612
and I love football!

622
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,907
(cheering and applause)

623
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,157
But you know the one thing

624
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,953
I love more than football?

625
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,622
God.

626
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,249

00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,334

00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,795
Let me tell you

629
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,795
another interesting fact

630
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,212
about my opponent.

631
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:07,467
Did you know that Sheldon Cooper

632
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:07,467
is an atheist?

633
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,510
(students gasping)

634
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,510
That's right.

635
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,555
He doesn't believe in God.

636
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,223
Just keep that in mind

637
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,559
when you cast your vote today.

638
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,854

Here's a fun fact

00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,929
about the next two words:

705
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,347

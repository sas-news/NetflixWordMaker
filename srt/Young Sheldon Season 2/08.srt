ADULT SHELDON:<i> Since the 1970s,</i>

00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:03,378
<i>home video games</i>

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,340
<i>have been coveted by children</i>

4
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,340
<i>around the world.</i>

5
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:09,009
<i>I was not one</i>

6
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:09,009
<i>of those children.</i>

7
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,886
What do you think?

8
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,886
I won it bowling.

9
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:12,387
It was either that

10
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:12,387
or a Crock-Pot,

11
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,806
and I already got

12
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,806
three of those,

13
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:16,183
so I thought I'd surprise you.

14
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,853
No, thank you.

15
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,853
Video games are for children.

16
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:21,939
Sheldon, you are a child.

17
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,107
I just blew the hot

18
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,107
off your SpaghettiOs.

19
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,651
I'm sorry, Meemaw,

20
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,319
I just don't think

21
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,319
it's a very productive

22
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,821
use of my time.

23
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:31,657
You're a man of science.

24
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:31,657
Aren't you interested

25
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:35,870
in doing a little research here?

26
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:38,873
"Brave adventurer,

27
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:38,873
prepare to enter a world

28
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,666
"beyond your imagination.

29
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,918
"Where the only sound you'll

30
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,918
hear is your own heart pounding

31
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,753
as you race through

32
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,753
the dark woods."

33
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,339
This sounds terrifying.

34
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,339
Really?

35
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,174
You don't even want to try it?

36
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,927
Honestly, I'd have more fun

37
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,927
with the Crock-Pot.

38
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:56,181
Fine. I'll just

39
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:56,181
play by myself.

40
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,559
That's amusing.

41
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,559
Why?

42
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,770
I guess it's the juxtaposition

43
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,770
of an old person

44
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,522
using new technology;

45
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,522
it tickles me.

46
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,985
What if this old person

47
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,985
really tickles you?

48
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,611
(laughing):

49
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,611
I'll play! I'll play!

any younger.

58
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:37,973
I have to read the

59
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:37,973
instructions first.

60
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:41,268
Did you know this document

61
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:41,268
gives us specific legal rights?

62
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:44,646
We may also have other rights

63
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:44,646
which vary from state to state?

64
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,231
I did not.

65
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,859
Well, now you do.

66
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,779
All right, I'm ready.

67
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,779
Great!

68
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,239
To read the

69
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,239
manufacturer's warranty.

70
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,451
Oh, you're killing me.

71
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,381
Hey, George, how y'all been?

72
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:14,384
Good, good. Hey, fixed your

73
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:14,384
place up, looking snazzy.

74
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,470
Ah, thanks. Even got

75
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,470
a new water cooler.

76
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:20,557
It's got those pointy cups,

77
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:20,557
look like Madonna's bra.

78
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,392
(chuckling)

79
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,186
So, what's going on

80
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,186
with your truck,

81
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:29,274
other than the fact it's

82
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:29,274
got 130,000 miles on it?

83
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,069
She been running hot. I'm

84
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,069
worried I need a new radiator.

85
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:34,989
As your friend and neighbor,

86
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:34,989
I hope not,

87
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,158
but as a businessman,

88
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,158
that'd be pretty sweet.

89
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,619
It could just be the thermostat

90
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,619
not opening right.

91
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,537
That is correct.

92
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,914
How'd you know that?

93
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,457
I took auto repair last year.

94
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,001
And you actually paid attention?

95
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,586
I'm as surprised as you are.

96
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:54,382
Now we need to put in

97
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:54,382
a name before we start.

98
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,343
What are you thinking?

99
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,846
We should combine the

100
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,846
letters in our two names,

101
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,514
Sheldon and Meemaw.

102
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,391
Like, uh... ShelMaw?

103
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:07,146
No, using all the

104
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:07,146
letters, like...

105
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,647
Emelda Showmen.

106
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,316
Did you just do that

107
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,316
in your head?

108
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,609
Yes, why?

109
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,696
Never mind, just put it down.

110
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,450
All right, here we go.

111
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,201
I thought I was playing.

112
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,579
You don't know how to play;

113
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,579
you didn't read the manual.

114
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,332
You're in charge, Emelda.

115
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,709
Thank you.

116
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,171
Should I go left or right?

117
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:35,382
Why don't you try going

118
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:35,382
in that cave?

119
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,093
Why would I do that?

120
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,093
It's probably dangerous.

121
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,803
Sheldon, they wouldn't

122
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,803
have put the cave there

123
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,722
if they didn't

124
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,722
want you to go in it.

125
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,432
Seems unnecessarily

126
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,432
reckless, but okay.

127
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,188
Dark and dangerous.

128
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,522
I told you.

129
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,440
Just keep going.

130
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,653
The box was right,

131
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,653
my heart is pounding.

132
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,405
All right,

133
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,199
good news.

134
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,408
Tell me.

135
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,952
Well, the kid

136
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,952
was right--

137
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,370
it's just the thermostat.

138
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,041
Yeah, yeah.

139
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,041
So how long to fix it?

140
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,959
Nothing, 20 minutes.

141
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,959
Can I help?

142
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,171
Well, sure. Grab yourself a pair

143
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,171
of coveralls and have at it.

144
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,547
Thanks.

145
00:04:16,505 --> 00:04:17,925
Really?

146
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,760
I'm paying you

147
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,760
so my own son can fix my truck?

148
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,762
Well, we could have

149
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,762
my son do it,

150
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,140
but we know how

151
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,140
that's gonna end.

152
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,893
MEEMAW:

153
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,893
What are you doing?

154
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,519
Kill him!

155
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,519
I'm trying!

156
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,105
Well, what's

157
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,105
the problem?

158
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,856
I seem to have weak thumbs.

159
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,315
Pause it.

160
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,819
I'm a little winded.

161
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,114
Why don't you let the old person

162
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,114
give it a shot?

163
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,824
Would you like me to give

164
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,824
you a tutorial first?

165
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,285
Give it to me.

166
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,285
I'll figure it out.

167
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,038
We are such different

168
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,038
people, Meemaw.

169
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,249
Thank you.

170
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,881
Die, you sumbitches, die!

171
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,968
Very different people.

172
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,968
Die, you son bitches!

173
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,680
When I grow up, will I be

174
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,680
a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader?

175
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,268
"Not likely." Darn it.

176
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,602
Did you tell her?

177
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:11,853
Why don't you tell her?

178
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,230
Tell me what?

179
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:15,107
Herschel offered me

180
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:15,107
a part-time job.

181
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,818
Really?

182
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,818
Between that

183
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,445
and football practice,

184
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,445
when would you do your homework?

185
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,738
When does he do it?

186
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,824
Are you okay with this?

187
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,617
Yeah, I think it'll

188
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,617
be good for him.

189
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:29,246
I don't know, I think his

190
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:29,246
education should come first.

191
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,372
Come on, Mom. It's not like

192
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,372
I'm gonna graduate

193
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,125
"val-dictator-torian."

194
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,210
You heard him.

195
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:39,173
(sighs) Fine, but I want you

196
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:39,173
here for dinner every night,

197
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,382
and if your grades slip,

198
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,382
you are done.

199
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,551
Thank you.

200
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,551
Now go wash up.

201
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,846
And don't get grease

202
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,846
all over my towels.

203
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:49,432
He really did know his stuff

204
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:49,432
at the shop. It was impressive.

205
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,560
All right, well,

206
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,560
maybe it'll be a good thing.

207
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,648
How about a Houston

208
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,648
Oilers cheerleader?

209
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,235
"Signs point to yes."

210
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,235
I'm gonna marry a quarterback.

211
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,653
(sighs)

212
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,036
ADULT SHELDON:<i> </i>

213
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,036
<i>Over the next few days,</i>

214
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,453
<i>I ran to my meemaw's house</i>

215
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,164
<i>so we could save</i>

216
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,164
<i>the 8-bit princess.</i>

217
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,832
<i>And if it's unclear</i>

218
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,832
<i>how important this was,</i>

219
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,126
<i>let me say it again: I ran.</i>

220
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,503
Right behind you,

221
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,503
monster, monster!

222
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,838
I see him!

223
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,923
You're losing life points,

224
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,923
do something!

225
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,925
Calm down, I've got this.

226
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,468
No, no, no,

227
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,468
you're going to die!

228
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,262
We're going to have

229
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,262
to restart this level!

230
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,557
Okay, we need to set

231
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,557
a few ground rules.

232
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,725
Rules, love 'em.

233
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,768
Mazes, puzzles,

234
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,768
panic attacks,

235
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,854
you're in charge.

236
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,066
Whooping monster butt,

237
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,066
that's my purview.

238
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,567
Understood.

239
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,567
However...

240
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,277
Excuse me. Is there

241
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,277
a monster on that screen?

242
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,820
Yes, ma'am.

243
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:48,075
And can two players

244
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:48,075
swing the magic sword?

245
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:48,075
No.

246
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,869
So what does that mean

247
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,869
as we go forward?

248
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,205
I have to shut my yap.

249
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,332
Attaboy.

250
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,918
Can I still have

251
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,918
a panic attack?

252
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,628
If you do it quietly.

253
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,257
(game beeping)

254
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,259
(whoops)

255
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,136
(laughing): No, no, no.

256
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,973
So me and Herschel dropped

257
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,973
the engine on this Pacer today.

258
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,808
It was so cool.

259
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,808
(chuckles)

260
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,436
I had a buddy in high school

261
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,436
had a Pacer

262
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,230
with the flames

263
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,230
painted on the side,

264
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,315
which was funny 'cause

265
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,315
the damn thing caught fire

266
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,359
during the Homecoming parade.

267
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,693
Too bad he didn't know Herschel.

268
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,405
He can fix anything.

269
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,405
Guy's a genius.

270
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,283
You mean

271
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,283
a car genius.

272
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,911
Is Dad getting his

273
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,911
feelings hurt? "Yes."

274
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,997
The ball don't lie.

275
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,457
Sorry!

276
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,750
MEEMAW:

277
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,750
Excuse us.

278
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,629
Thank you.

279
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,672
See you later.

280
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,672
(door closes)

281
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,762
(Meemaw whoops)

282
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,142
SHELDON: There it is!

283
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,142
The cyclops!

284
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,602
MEEMAW: I see it!

285
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,602
Get it, get it!

286
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,771
I'm trying!

287
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,771
Use the sword!

288
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,856
Use the sword!

289
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,856
Your yap is open again.

290
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,401
Hello?

291
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:06,361
What?

292
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,363
It's past his bedtime. Let's go.

293
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,241
Oh, come on, five more minutes?

294
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,826
No. Now say good night

295
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,826
to your grandson.

296
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,454
You'll play with him

297
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,454
again tomorrow.

298
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,664
Good night, Sheldon.

299
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,958
Good night, Meemaw.

300
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,544
Don't play without me.

301
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,046
Of course not.

302
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,342
How old are you?

303
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,968
(blows raspberry)

304
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,053
And I got my answer.

305
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,436
Hey, neighbor, what's up?

306
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,895
Sorry to bother you so late,

307
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,106
but one of my guys

308
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,106
called in sick tomorrow...

309
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,983
So we couldn't find

310
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,983
the key to the palace,

311
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,320
but then I figured out it was

312
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,320
in the hay behind the stables.

313
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,529
Great.

314
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,032
Hey, Herschel.

315
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,032
Mary.

316
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,075
I also found us extra life

317
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,075
points inside a demon.

318
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,452
There are demons in this game?

319
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,454
Don't worry, Meemaw

320
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,454
cut his head off.

321
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:00,457
Anyhoo, uh, I was wondering

322
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:03,293
if Georgie could come by after

323
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:03,293
school tomorrow and help me out.

324
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:06,254
Oh, I don't know, Herschel,

325
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:06,254
he's got football practice.

326
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,382
Mm.

327
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,382
What's going on?

328
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,550
Herschel's asking if you

329
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,550
want to work after school.

330
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,759
Great, I'll be there.

331
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,720
What about football?

332
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,720
What about it?

333
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,138
I mostly sit

334
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,138
on the bench all day.

335
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,639
That's because

336
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,639
you got to earn your way

337
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,058
on to first string.

338
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,894
Or I can earn some money

339
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,894
working for Herschel.

340
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,188
Why don't you and I talk a bit

341
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,188
before you make a decision?

342
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,107
Sorry, I-I didn't mean

343
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,107
to cause a problem.

344
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,734
I'll find somebody else.

345
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,734
Y'all have a good night.

346
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,486
Night, Herschel.

347
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,486
Night.

348
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,822
Thanks a lot.

349
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,032
You really want

350
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,032
to quit football

351
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,368
to go work

352
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,368
in a garage?

353
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,368
Hell yeah.

354
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,245
I thought you loved the game.

355
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,664
I do, but look at me.

356
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,664
I weigh 125 pounds.

357
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,875
That's not important.

358
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,875
It's not?

359
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,002
Every time I get tackled,

360
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,002
somebody's got to run over

361
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,296
with smelling salts

362
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,296
just to wake me back up.

363
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,299
Well, this isn't your decision.

364
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,299
You're gonna play football.

365
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,592
You can't make me.

366
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,636
Oh yeah? Wait and see.

367
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,931
Screw this.

368
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,398
ADULT SHELDON:

369
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,398
<i>Even while sleeping,</i>

370
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,649
<i>my quest to save</i>

371
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,649
<i>the princess continued,</i>

372
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,194
<i>which was quite a departure</i>

373
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,194
<i>from my usual dreams,</i>

374
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,530
<i>such as determining</i>

375
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,530
<i>the coolest prime number--</i>

376
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,574
<i>which, by the way, is 73.</i>

377
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,368
Kill it, Meemaw! Kill it!

378
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,455
What do you think I'm trying

379
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,455
to do? It won't die.

380
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,164
Maybe you need

381
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,164
a different weapon.

382
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:26,042
I already tried the

383
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:26,042
slingshot and the boomerang.

384
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,711
All I have left is

385
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,711
the damn flute.

386
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,589
It's a piccolo.

387
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,589
Didn't you pay attention

388
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,466
when the old lady gave it to us?

389
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,800
(gasps)

390
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,307
MEEMAW: Hello?

391
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,307
Meemaw.

392
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,893
I'm sorry for waking you, but

393
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,893
I know how to kill the cyclops.

394
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,562
We have to play the piccolo.

395
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:46,813
Ooh.

396
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,023
What a great idea, moonpie.

397
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,317
We'll try it tomorrow.

398
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,444
Excellent... Wait.

399
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:55,155
How'd you answer your phone so

400
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:55,155
fast? It's not next to your bed.

401
00:10:55,196 --> 00:11:00,368
Uh, well, actually,

402
00:10:55,196 --> 00:11:00,368
I was on my way to the bathroom.

403
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,330
You know us old people

404
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,330
and our bladders.

405
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:06,040
I'll call you right back.

406
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,089
That fibber.

407
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,509
You're playing

408
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,509
the game right now.

409
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,759
I am not.

410
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,095
I saw you with my binoculars.

411
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,222
Oh. How about that.

412
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,057
You promised not to play

413
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,057
without me.

414
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,143
We're a team.

415
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,143
Emelda Showmen, remember?

416
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,896
I'm turning off the game

417
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,896
and going to sleep right now.

418
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,149
You'd better.

419
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,443
I love you, good night.

420
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,864
Binoculars for his birthday.

421
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,740
What was I thinking?

422
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,954
(radio playing faintly)

423
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,540
Where's Georgie?

424
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,375
Don't worry about it.

425
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,917
I wasn't worried.

426
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,253
I was practicing chitchat.

427
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,382
Your mother's taking him

428
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,382
to school.

429
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,385
That's not very efficient.

430
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,385
Our car's already going there.

431
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,554
Not that it's any

432
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,554
of your business,

433
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,347
but I needed a break

434
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,347
from your brother.

435
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,559
I certainly understand that.

436
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,559
He's an acquired taste.

437
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,561
Like Grape-Nuts.

438
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:10,063
The first time I tried it,

439
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:10,063
I thought I was eating gravel.

440
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,274
But then I put a little sugar

441
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,274
on it and let it get soggy.

442
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,527
Now it's in my top six cereals.

443
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,154
I'll try soaking Georgie

444
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,154
in a bowl of milk.

445
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,699
Sarcasm?

446
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:21,991
Yeah.

447
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,742
I had a feeling.

448
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,705
The clue was you don't normally

449
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,705
put people in bowls of milk.

450
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,456

his older brother also?

464
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,958
Nah. She doesn't

This is hooky, Meemaw.

Hooky is a serious offense.

Not really.

That's it? You're not gonna

490
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,479
ask me what's going on?

I feel bad about Georgie

545

I appreciate that,

548

but you got to know

549
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,679
there's an upside to this.

550
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,222
And that would be?

551
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:17,310
Your son has got a special gift.

552
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,019
A gift?

553
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,730
We are talking

554
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,730
about Georgie, right?

555
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,691
Yeah. I mean, first off,

556
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,691
the kid really knows his way

557
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,736
around an engine,

558
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,736
which is all well and good.

559
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:30,030
But when it comes

560
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:30,030
to fixing tires,

561
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:34,160
I swear, I've never seen

562
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:34,160
anything like him.

563
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,078
Tires? How do you mean?

564
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,123
George, I've been patching flats

565
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,123
for 25 years.

566
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,125
You know,

567
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,125
slap some soapy water on them,

568
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,585
look for

569
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,585
the air bubble.

570
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:46,673
But your son,

571
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:46,673
he doesn't need any tricks.

572
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:50,134
He knows

573
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:50,134
where the puncture holes are.

574
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,427
He knows?

575
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,596
He knows.

576
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,683
He's got a sixth sense

577
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,683
for tire damage.

578
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,058
I mean,

579
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,058
you got to see him in action.

580
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,394
I-It'll give you chills.

581
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,604
You know, now that you say it,

582
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:02,897
whenever we had

583
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:02,897
a leaky football,

584
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,983
he knew exactly

585
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,983
where the hole was.

586
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,736
I am telling you, your boy's got

587
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,736
a future in the tire business.

588
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:12,656
Goodyear, Firestone, somebody's

589
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:12,656
gonna scoop him up first round.

590
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,701
Thanks, Herschel.

591
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,117
That does my heart good.

592
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,913
So I guess you got two geniuses

593
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,913
in the family.

594
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,373
Guess I do.

595
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,542
Who knows,

596
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,542
maybe Missy'll make it three.

597
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,503
Or it's two.

598
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,214
(both laugh)

599
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:41,561
I won. I saved the princess.

600
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,604
I knew you could do it!

601
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,315
Yes! We saved her!

602
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,192
We saved the princess!

603
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,192
We did it!

604
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,277
We did it.

605
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,277
Yep.

606
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,280
(chuckles)

607
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,449
(music stops)

608
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,869
So now what?

609
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:01,121
We just return

610
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:01,121
to our ordinary lives?

611
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,667
I guess so.

612
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:11,883
Or... we could just go to

613
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:11,883
the store and buy another game.

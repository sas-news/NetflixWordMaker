I'm Paige.

4
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,339
This is a very advanced class.

5
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,800
Do you know how to differentiate

6
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,800
under the integral sign?

7
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:09,009
No.

8
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,218
(chuckling):

9
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,218
Do you know anything?

10
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,011
I know you're in my spot.

11
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:15,015
These are parents

12
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:15,015
we can actually relate to.

13
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:16,642
Sounds good.

14
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:16,642
Oh, thank you, Lord,

15
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,310
for connecting us

16
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,310

18
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,691
You kids are special, too.

19
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,694
I used to work at the practice

20
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,694

21
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,570
once Paige's schedule

22
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,570
started to get busy.

23
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,448
Well, a unique child can

24
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,448
require a lot of attention.

25
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,241

Barry, it sounds like

27
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,452
you might be feeling left out.

28
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:36,954

00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,145
Fine.

148
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:49,479

149
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,856
Five dollars.

150
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,856
Each.

151
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:51,940
Each.

152
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,359
That's pretty steep.

153
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,277
How about I give you

154
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,277
a buck apiece?

155
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,948
Let's meet in the middle--

156
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,948
three dollars each.

157
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,992
Now we're haggling.

158
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,493
Let me ask you a question.

159
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,953
If you break something today,

160
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,164
are you prepared

161
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,164
to cover the cost of that?

162
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,707
No.

163
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,707
Nuh-uh.

164
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,707
Mm.

165
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,667
Well, we're gonna have

166
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,667
to factor that in.

167
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,753
And did you bring

168
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,753
your own lunch?

169
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,214
You said we were

170
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,214
getting pizza.

171
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,298
Well, I did,

172
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,298
but pizza ain't free.

173
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,009
And I'm teaching you

174
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,009
about negotiating,

175
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,511
which is a pretty valuable

176
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,511
life lesson, right?

177
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,346
Yeah.

178
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,346
I guess so.

179
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,306
So, if my math is right,

180
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,477
you owe me...

181
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,477
two dollars each.

182
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,105
We owe you?

183
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,481
The numbers don't lie.

184
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,734
Dang it.

185
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,652
All right, listen.

186
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,780
I love ya, and you're family,

187
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,991
so if you do it for nothing,

188
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,991
we'll call it even.

189
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,534
Take it, take it, take it.

190
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,745

(muffled laughter):

194
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:53,252
Now start bringing

195
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:53,252
that crap outside.

Oh, my.

00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,723
GEORGE SR.:

200
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,723
Yeah.

201
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,349
I bet he dresses down

202
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,894
to about 6,000, 7,000

203
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,894
pounds of USDA prime.

204
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,187
You would eat him?

205
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,022
He'd eat me.

206
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,444
Wow. You're really

207
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,444
cleaning house.

208
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,280
Got to get rid of

209
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,280
the old gar-bage,

210
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,157
make room for the new gar-bage.

211
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,532
This was Dad's.

212
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,577
You're not getting

213
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,577
rid of this, are you?

214
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:28,829
Didn't need it when he shot it,

215
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,080
didn't need it

216
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,080
when he stuffed it,

217
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,372
don't need it now.

218
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,372
Really?

219
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,583
It was his first

220
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,583
attempt at taxidermy.

221
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,960
He was so proud.

222
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,670
If it has sentimental

223
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,670
value to you,

224
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,421
I'll let you have it

225
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,421
for five dollars.

226
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,174
Ooh. For this nasty thing?

227
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,758
(drops raccoon on table)

228
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,303
Oh, you're selling

229
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,303
his golf clubs, too?

230
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,345
Which one of your

231
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,345
children do you see

232
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,473

233
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,473
Palmer in the future?

234
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,685
Dad's clothes,

235
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,685
his shoes, his pipes?

236
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,271
Honey, it's just stuff.

237
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:56,023
I know, but still...

238
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,607
I get how you're feeling.

239
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,067
I do.

240
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,277
Now go away.

241
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,445
I got a lot of crap to sell.

You gonna be okay by yourself?

I actually prefer it.

Yep. I'm leaving.

I'm so happy to see you.

Are you happy to see me?

261
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,439
Not immediately.

00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,607
That's okay.

263

Oh, Paige's mom.

What a nice surprise.

00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,218
I just dropped Paige off

281
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,218

282
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,635

Well, how about that?

Sure.

Mm.

Oh, Barry?

Who cares? (laughs)

294
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,407
That doesn't sound good.

295

Oh, sorry. Just ignore me.

00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,453
Okay. (chuckles)

Oh, hey, you want a wing?

Yeah, no, thank you.

Oh, no, not at all. Enjoy.

311
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,275
Oh... forget it. (laughs)

Fine, I'll tell you. Barry and I

haven't been in a good place

315
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,116
in a long time, and I...

316
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,743
I think we're headed

317
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,743
for divorce.

318
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,871
I'm sorry. Uh...

319
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,748
I don't know what to say.

320
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,792
Uh, oh. (sniffles)

321
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,961
You don't have to say anything.

(laughs)

323
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,046
That I can do.

00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,340
Ooh.

All right, everybody, welcome.

330
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,225
Glad to see

331
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,225

Well, hello.

334
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,147
Hi.

335
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,147
Hi.

336
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,147
This is a nice surprise.

337
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,233
I don't usually see

338
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,233

339
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,278

accelerator mass spectrometry,

341
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,863
and wanted to find out more.

342
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,239
Is that so?

343
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,033
And you?

344
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,535
I read this magazine.

345
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,995
Uh-huh.

346
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,080
It has puzzles, too.

347
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,458
Okay.

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,625
(clears throat)

349
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,419
Do you want to kick this off

350
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,587
and tell us

351
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,587
exactly what carbon dating is?

352
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,217
The 5,730-year half-life

353
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,217
of carbon 14

354
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,843
is used as a geochronometer.

355
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,928
Anything else you'd like to add?

356
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,557
Um...

357
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:21,853
carbon dating is how we figured

358
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:21,853
out how old my grandmother is.

359
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,605

I mean, you, of all people,

367
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,415
would understand.

368
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,375

I do, I do.

372
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:48,338
How do you and Mary

373
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:48,338
handle the stress?

374
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,965
Well, we actually have

375
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,965
a pretty good system.

376
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,509
Oh, please tell me.

377
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,844
We don't talk about it.

378
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,513
Not at all?

379
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:57,931
Zippo.

380
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,600
Boy, that doesn't sound

381
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,600
like it could work.

382
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,728
Suit yourself,

00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,728
but I'm having a nice day;

384
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,814
you're crying

385

386
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,444
For now, let's neglect changes

387
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,444
in the isotopic

388
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,987
ratio of the air

389
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,987
over thousands of years.

390
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,074
(whispering):

391
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,074
This is pretty basic stuff.

392
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,159
(whispering):

393
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,159
Yes.

394
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,161
I'm bored.

395
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,080
Let's get out of here.

396
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,124
I can't. I told my dad

397
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,667
I'd stay here until

398
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,667
the end of the lecture.

399
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,004
Okay. Be a baby.

400
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,881
I'm leaving.

401
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,967
In our case,

402
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,967
the math yields

403
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,887
approximately

404
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,887
48,000 years.

405
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,056
ADULT SHELDON:

406
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,056
<i>I was most certainly</i>

407
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,056
<i>not a baby.</i>

408
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,142
<i>If anyone was a baby,</i>

409
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,142
<i>it was she,</i>

410
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,018
<i>because people</i>

411
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,018
<i>who call other people babies</i>

412
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,979
<i>are the real babies.</i>

413
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,523
(whispering):

414
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,523
Wait up.

415
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,861
(sniffing)

416
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,238
I like it.

417
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,157
It likes you.

418
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,409
How much?

419
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,409
Five dollars.

420
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,161
I only have 50 cents.

421
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,829
That's okay.

422
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,829
We're haggling.

423
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,914
I don't know what that means.

424
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,501
You make me an offer, and

425
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,501
we meet in the middle.

426
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,669
The middle of what?

427
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,839
I'm not really sure.

428
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,636
Hmm.

429
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,430
(chuckles)

430
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,059
What are you doing?

431
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,062
Considering buying this jacket.

432
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,858
I found chewing tobacco

433
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,858
and Juicy Fruit in the pocket.

434
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,611
Does that come with it,

435
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,611
or is it extra?

436
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,447
Actually, that's not for sale.

437
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,407
Why don't you look

438
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,407
for something else.

439
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,368
You sure?

440
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,368
There's a price tag on it.

441
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,036
Just take it off.

442
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,788
Is this some kind of

443
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,788
bargaining technique?

444
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,415
Because I should warn you.

445
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,543
I've been to the

446
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,543
bazaars in Istanbul,

447
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:54,755
where the negotiations are fast,

448
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:54,755
furious and bilingual.

449
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,550
Just take it off, damn it.

450
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,180
What just happened?

451
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,891
That's my dad's jacket.

452
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,143
Oh.

453
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,230
Still don't know what happened.

454
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,942
Do you think humans will become

455
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,942
extinct like the dinosaurs?

456
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,862
Yes, but before that happens,

457
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,862
some of us will merge

458
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,947
with computers and

459
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,947
become immortal cyborgs.

460
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,949
That's a fascinating idea.

461
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,201
Thank you.

462
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,704
Did you get that

463
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,704
from a TV show?

464
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,163
No.

465
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,500
A comic book.

466
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,338
(sportscaster speaks on TV)

467
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,338
And then when Paige turned six,

468
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,338
it was obvious

469
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,755
she wasn't like

470
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,755
the other kids,

471
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,299
and she needed a school

472
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,299
where she could excel.

473
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,635
Uh-huh.

474
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,635
But Barry's

475
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,635
dental practice

476
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,721
was 50 miles

477
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,721
outside of Fayetteville,

478
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,390
and do you know what's available

479
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,390
for extraordinary children

480
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,642
50 miles outside

481
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,642
of Fayetteville?

482
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:48,976
I'm gonna guess not much.

483
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:48,976
Nothing.

484
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,687
Mm-hmm.

485
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:53,189
So I packed us up, and I made

486
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:53,189
him move to Texas where,

487
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,275
believe it or not,

488
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,275
people do get cavities.

489
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,611
I believe it.

490
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,611
I had a humdinger last summer.

491
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,154
Face swelled up

492
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,154
like a cantaloupe.

493
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,154
And do you know

494
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,906
he's been cool to me ever since,

495
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,991
even though

496
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,991
his practice is making money

497
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,535
hand over fist.

498
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,535
Yeah, yeah.

499
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:06,911
SPORTSCASTER:

500
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:06,911
A flag down...

501
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,329
And as much as he

502
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,329
says I ignore him,

503
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,914
he ignores me just as much.

504
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,333
I mean, would it kill him

505
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,333
to get a babysitter every once

506
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,544
in a while and take me

507
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,544
to dinner, maybe a movie?

508
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:15,587
It would not.

509
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,756
Oh, darn. You didn't see me.

510
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:22,218
Then you've got fourth down,

511
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:22,218
and he throws the...

512
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,512
BARRY:

513
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,512
George!

514
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,266
Hey.

515
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,266
(chuckles)

516
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,476
Paige's dad.

517
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,437
Barry. Yeah, of course,

518
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,437
I remember.

519
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,854
What are you doing here?

520
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,315
Uh, just, you know,

521
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,233
Sheldon wanted to go

522
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,233
to a science lecture.

523
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,485
No kidding.

524
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,818
We just dropped Paige off there.

525
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,780
You don't say. (chuckles)

526
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,448
PAIGE: Ooh. (chuckles)

527
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,199
Caveman stuff.

528
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,199
I love that.

529
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,327
Where are you going?

530
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,327
It's closed.

531
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,913
I can read... baby.

532
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,209
Just so you know,

533
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,209
that won't work every time.

534
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,797
You haven't, uh,

535
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,797
seen Linda around, have you?

536
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,507
Linda.

537
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,841
Your wife, Linda.

538
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,843
(laughing):

539
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,843
Yeah. No.

540
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,554
So what's new?

541
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,139
Oh, not much.

542
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,182
Hey, you like football?

543
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,517
No.

544
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,519
Well, you sure?

545
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,519
It's a close game.

546
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,063
Uh, no, no, I'm, uh,

547
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,063
more of a tennis man.

548
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,318
Well, those are two very

549
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,318
different sports, aren't they?

550
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,195
SPORTSCASTER:

551
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,195
I think you've got to go outside

552
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,946
and rely on somebody like...

553
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:28,409
George... can I confide in you?

554
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,422
♪ ♪

555
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:45,844
This is oddly reminiscent

556
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:45,844
of a dinner with my family.

557
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,470
You're funny.

558
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,180
I know.

559
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,307
My family never

560
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,307
eats dinner together.

561
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,100
Why not?

562
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,103
My dad always manages to come

563
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,103
home from work after we're done.

564
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,982
Hmm. My dad never

565
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,982
misses a meal.

566
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,194
Do you think Stone Age parents

567
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,194
stayed together forever?

568
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,446
They had to.

569
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,446
There were no lawyers.

570
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,906
(laughs)

571
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,906
What?

572
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,199
That was funny.

573
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,827
Right, we've

574
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,827
established I'm funny.

575
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,204
Well, I think my parents

576
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,204
are getting a divorce.

577
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,539
Why?

578
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:15,832
They fight all the time.

579
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:18,167
About what?

580
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:18,167
Mostly me.

581
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,961
Hmm. That's too bad.

582
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,797
I guess I'm lucky.

583
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,257
Why?

584
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,092
I'm the glue that holds

585
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,092
our family together.

586
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,761
(knocking)

587
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,888
What are you kids

588
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,888
doing in there?

589
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,018
Okay, ten cents a week

590
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,018
for a whole year.

591
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,647
I get the raccoon, and to tell

592
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,647
people you're my girlfriend.

593
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,942
15 cents a week, and if you

594
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,942
say hello to me in school,

595
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,277
I'll say hello back.

596
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,446
Deal.

597
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,451
Connie, I need to apologize.

598
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,203
Oh, that's okay.

599
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,203
Don't worry about it.

600
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,080
No, I am worrying about it.

601
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,793
I didn't realize that with you

602
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,793
and I being in a relationship,

603
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,878
me wearing

604
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,878
your dead husband's clothes

605
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,214
would be emotionally

606
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,214
challenging for you.

607
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,801
All right, apology accepted.

608
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,427
Thank you.

609
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,349
Are you okay?

610
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:22,565
I guess I just didn't expect

611
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:22,565
that getting rid of my...

612
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:26,486
my husband's stuff

613
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:26,486
was gonna hit me so hard.

614
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,699
He must have been

615
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,699
a wonderful man.

616
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:35,077
(laughs)

617
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:35,077
Well, he had his moments.

618
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:39,540
He was married to a wonderful

619
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:39,540
woman, so that says a lot.

620
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,877
You're pretty

621
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,877
wonderful yourself.

622
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,046
Thank you.

623
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:50,217
Now, let's talk

624
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:50,217
about this hula girl lamp.

625
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,345
What's your best price?

626
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,555
It's my gift to you.

627
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,015
Nice haggle.

628
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,476
Nice mullet.

629
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,728
Thanks again.

630
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,481
Real sorry

631
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,481
about this.

632
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,441
What were you

633
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,441
thinking?

634
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,693
I got bored.

635
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:07,734
'Cause you're a baby.

636
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:08,862
LINDA:

637
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:08,862
What happened?

638
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,195
BARRY:

639
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,195
Everything's fine.

640
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,906
They just

641
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,906
wandered off.

642
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,032
Hey, Linda, nice to see you.

643
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,368
George, Sheldon's dad.

644
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,579
Oh, sure, yes. Hi.

645
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:22,165
Well, good to see you folks.

646
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,084
Take care.

647
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,924
Did you know that her parents

648
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,924
are getting a divorce?

649
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,134
Just keep walking.

650
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,134
Keep walking.

651
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,308
(laughing):

652
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,308
What... what is that for?

653
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,310
Well, can't I

654
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,310
appreciate my wife?

655
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,312
What did you do now?

656
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,480
I didn't do anything.

657
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,524
Want to hear something cool?

658
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,943
Sheldon skipped out

659
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,943
of that lecture

660
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,654
with that little Paige girl,

661
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,654
snuck into a closed exhibit.

662
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,948
You're kidding.

663
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,948
True. (laughs)

664
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,368
Even got, uh, "arrested"

665
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,368
by the museum security cops.

666
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,203
Why would you think that's cool?

667
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,330
Sheldon got into trouble

668
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,330
with a girl!

669
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,290
I'm bursting with pride.

670
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,751
(sighs)

671
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,420
You know what? I don't

672
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,420
want to talk about it.

673
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,214
There, right there.

674
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,466
That's why I love you.

675
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,434
You gonna eat

676
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,434
your beans?

677
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,937
Yeah, I'm gonna

678
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,937
eat my beans. Duh.

679
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,271
What about your tots?

680
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,773
Those, too.

681
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,773
Georgie!

682
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,190
Just eat your

683
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,190
own dinner.

684
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,358
Dad?

685
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,735
Can't have my

686
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,735
tots, either!

687
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,320
(grunting)

688
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,823
(George Sr. grunts)

689
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,617
(all grunting)

690
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,203
(bird screeches,

691
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,203
grunting continues)

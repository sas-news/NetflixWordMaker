Duncan hugging you?

4
00:00:03,963 --> 00:00:05,923
I'm tutoring her

5
00:00:03,963 --> 00:00:05,923

00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:08,216
Just between us,

00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:08,216
she's a little slow.

8
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,636
That's not what I heard.

9
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,220
There's nobody

10
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,220
at my house.

11
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,640
You want to come over?

12
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,640
Yes.

13
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,391
What's that?

14
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,391
Some stupid haunted house

Fine, what are you working on?

There's a number,

44
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,224
then there's a line,

45
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,309

imagine a pie.

The number on the bottom

76
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,113
Doesn't matter.

77
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,489

Fine, it's banana cream.

80
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,536
I don't like banana cream.

81
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,289
Okay, what kind of pie

82
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,289

83
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,125

00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,878
Sure.

86
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,878
I burned my mouth

You-you changed your hair.

93
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,350
I did.

94
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,603
It's shorter.

95
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,064

96
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:29,357

99
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:35,030
I-I'm here for your mom's

100
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:35,030
Bible study.

101
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:38,826
Oh, sure, of course.

102
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,452
I'm glad you could join us.

103

104
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,332
(chuckles)

105
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,332
You're part of the group, too?

106
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:49,920
Faith, the Bible, God,

107
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:49,920
I'm nuts for that stuff.

108

(laughs softly)

109
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:58,762
So one-fourth

110
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:58,762
of the 12 pieces of pie is...?

111
00:02:58,804 --> 00:02:59,805
Three?

112
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,515
Yes.

113
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,144
And one-third

114
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,144
of the 12 pieces is...?

115
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,603
Four?

116
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:09,230
Yes. Now how much is one-third

117
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:09,230
of the pie plus

118
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,941
one-fourth of the pie?

119
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:16,446
Well, three plus four is seven,

120
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:16,446
but there's 12 pieces,

121
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,949
so seven-twelve-iths.

122
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:22,161
It's twelfths. And yes.

123
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,538
I did it.

00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,512
What's it look like?

132
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,512
I'm here for Bible study.

133
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,597
Did you just take a shower?

134
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,724
No.

135
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,559
(sniffs)

136
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,559
You did, too.

137
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,187
So I want to be clean for Jesus.

138
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,187
Get off my back.

139
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,606
Interesting.

140
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,984
Georgie, if you want

141
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,984
to be a good Christian,

142
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,944
maybe you should stop

143
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,944
lying through your teeth.

144
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,821
Just be happy

145
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,821
I brushed them, okay?

146
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,365

While we're here,

151

would you like me

152

153
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,121
Al who?

154
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,748
Oh, boy.

155
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,290
It's not a person, it's

156
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,290
an ancient Arabic method

157
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,460
of finding the value

158
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,460
of variables.

159
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,588

Are you sure?

If you learn a little algebra,

165

I'll give you a banana.

166
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,895

195
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,532
Need any help there, Sheldon?

196
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,532
I'm looking

197
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,701
for some books

198
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,701
on education theory.

199
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,369
What for?

200
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,369
I'm trying

201
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,080
to develop a technique

202
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,080
to teach someone

203
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:33,000
who falls into the conventional

204
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:33,000
category of "stupid."

205
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,086
Oh. Well, now, there's a wide

206
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,086
range of stupid.

207
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,005
Can you narrow it down?

208
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,174
She wrote a fan letter to Alf.

209
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:44,552
Got it. So you're looking

210
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:44,552
to make a pretty radical change.

211
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,139
Well, ideally, I'd like to wipe

212
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,139
my sister's brain clean

213
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,766
and start over,

214
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,766
but my mom wouldn't like that.

215
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,144
Yeah. Moms are no fun.

216
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,287
Hey, Veronica.

217
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,914
Georgie.

218
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,914
So, listen,

219
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,791
I was doing my prayers

220
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,791
last night and, uh,

221
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,544
you won't believe it,

222
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,544
but I think God spoke to me.

223
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,379
Really? What did he say?

224
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,965
Well, I couldn't

225
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,965
understand

226
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,176
all of it, 'cause it was in

227
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,176
an ancient language,

228
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,760
but the part I did understand

229
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,596
is he wants us to spend

230
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,596
more time together.

231
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,765
Doing what?

232
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,434
Oh, you know, praying,

233
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,434
helping the needy.

234
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,478
Your usual Christian activities.

235
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,981
Well, I'm okay with that.

236
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:42,485
Good. So you, me and God,

237
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:42,485
we'll hang out.

238
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,238
Sounds good.

239
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,115
Okay. See you later.

240
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,077
(chuckles)

241
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,077
See you.

242
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,538
I may be going to hell.

243
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,748
(exhales sharply)

244
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,666
So you're hoping

245
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,666
to create an army

246
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,669
of super-intelligent children

247
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,669
who will do your bidding?

248
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,380
In a perfect world, yes.

249
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,464
You should spend more time

250
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,464
with my mother.

251
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,674
That's her goal, too.

252
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,593
SHELDON: Ooh, this

253
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,593
is interesting.

254
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,428
According to Socrates,

255
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,428
all knowledge exists

256
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,224
within the student

257
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,224
and just needs to be drawn out

258
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,975
through skillful questioning.

259
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:17,478
Are you saying I knew that

260
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:17,478
before you even said it?

261
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,522
I don't know, did you?

262
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,522
Well, according

263
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:23,068
to Socrates, you do know

264
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:23,068
and the answer's inside you.

265
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,071
Well, then, ask me a skillful

266
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,071
question to draw it out.

267
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:30,491
Do you know

268
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:30,491
if I knew before I knew?

269
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,161
No.

270
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,705
Hey, it works.

271
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,041
It does.

272
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,508
(camera beeps, whirs)

273
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,511
I'm recording my findings

274
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,432
so that future generations

275
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,432
of mankind can understand

276
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,227
the steps I took to create

277
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,227
<i>homo novus,</i> "new man."

278
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,939
Of course, there's a strong

279
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,939
likelihood that my<i> homo novi</i>

280
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,399
might've wiped out

281
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,399
all future generations,

282
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:05,235
so I have no idea

283
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:05,235
who's watching this.

284
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,279
What are you doing in here?

285
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,531
I'm keeping a video diary of my

286
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,531
experiment to create<i> homo novus.</i>

287
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,992
<i>Homo</i> what?

288
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,786
<i>Novus.</i> It's Latin.

289
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,786
It means "new man."

290
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,165
Oh. I guess that's okay.

291
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,668
Y-Your mom's at church.

292
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,668
W-What do you want for dinner?

293
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:26,589
I believe you know

294
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:26,589
what I want for dinner.

295
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,258
Is that right?

296
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,759
It's Thursday.

297
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,679
What does Mom always make me

298
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,679
on Thursdays?

299
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,554
Spaghetti and hot dogs?

300
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,684
Socrates. Got to love him.

PASTOR JEFF:

318
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,220
And now,

319
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,222
why don't we take

320
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,222
a moment to pray,

321
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,140
uh, keeping in mind

322
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,140
that our prayers

323
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,559
should not be

324
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,559
for our own benefit,

325
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,978
but for our family, friends,

326
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,900
fellow Texans, Americans

327
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,900
of all races and religions

328
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,443
and the world.

329
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,736
Well, most of the world.

330
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,654
Y'all know what countries

331
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,654
to pick.

332
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,951
MARY:<i> Lord, please look</i>

333
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,951
<i>after my family.</i>

334
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,954
<i>Give them everything they need</i>

335
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,954
<i>to be happy and healthy.</i>

336

<i>And this lovely young girl</i>

337
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,249
<i>with me tonight,</i>

338
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,959
<i>help her stay on the path</i>

<i>of righteousness.</i>

VERONICA:<i> God,</i>

<i>please look after my sister.</i>

<i>You can find her at the women's</i>

<i>correctional facility</i>

<i>in Lubbock.</i>

345
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,467
<i>Help her seek salvation in you</i>

346
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,970
<i>instead of cocaine, marijuana</i>

347
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,970
<i>and bass players.</i>

GEORGIE:<i> Jesus, I'm sure,</i>

349
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,223

<i>how hot the girl</i>

351
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,183
<i>sitting next to me is.</i>

352
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,477
<i>And I know I'm not supposed</i>

353
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,477
<i>to pray for myself,</i>

354
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,396
<i>but here's the deal:</i>

355
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,396
<i>if you can get her</i>

356
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,273
<i>to fall in love with me,</i>

357
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,273
<i>and you know,</i>

358
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,857
<i>make some bad decisions,</i>

359
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,402
<i>I swear I'll come to church</i>

VERONICA:<i> And please protect me</i>

<i>from impure thoughts,</i>

370
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:26,209
<i>and teach me to respect</i>

<i>the sanctity of my body.</i>

<i>not only do I become</i>

<i>a devout Christian,</i>

380
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,096
<i>I will also bug everybody</i>

<i>I meet to do the same.</i>

382
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,722
<i>And you know</i>

<i>I can be real annoying</i>

00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,099
<i>when I set my mind to it.</i>

385
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,392
MARY:

386
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,392
<i>Amen.</i>

387
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,727
VERONICA:

388
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,727
<i>Amen.</i>

389
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,398
GEORGIE:<i> I'm gonna take</i>

390
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,398
<i>your silence as a yes. Amen.</i>

391
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,157
What are you working on?

392
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,535
A list of possible boyfriends

393
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,535
for my Cabbage Patch doll.

394
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:04,038
How do you think Celeste would

395
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:04,038
look next to Joey Lawrence?

396
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,124
I don't know who that is.

397
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,917
He's Blossom's brother.

398
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,128
I don't know who<i> that</i> is.

399
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,047
It's a show. She wears hats.

400
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,800
Anyway, I've been

401
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,800
doing some research,

402
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,844
and I've come to the conclusion

403
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,844
that I don't need

404
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,095
to teach you anything.

405
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,721
You already know everything.

406
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,056
Cool.

407
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,600
Your brain already

408
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,600
contains all the math

409
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,101
that will ever be known.

410
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,228
I heard you and I said "cool."

411
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,938
Well, wouldn't you

412
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,938
like to explore

413
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,441
that great treasure

414
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,441
trove of knowledge?

415
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:34,528
That depends. What's a trove?

416
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:37,614
We'll circle back to that.

417
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:37,614
True or false?

418
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,492
At times, you have referred

419
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,492
to yourself as being dumb.

420
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,076
True.

421
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,371
And do you enjoy

422
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,371
feeling that way?

423
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,498
No.

424
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,333
Well, let me change that.

425
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,959
I'm presenting you

426
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,959
with an opportunity

427
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,962
to achieve the full potential

428
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,962
of your mind.

429
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,425
Are you gonna do some experiment

430
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,425
where we switch brains?

431
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,052
No.

432
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,554
'Cause I've seen it

433
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,554
on<i> Gilligan's Island</i>

434
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,013
and I've seen it

435
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,013
on<i> The Flintstones</i>

436
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,265
and it never goes well.

437
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,767
(exhales sharply)

438
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,854
Ooh. Gilligan.

439
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:14,609
♪ Then sings my soul,

440
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:14,609
my savior God... ♪

441
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,944
Oh, who do you think

442
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,944
you're fooling here?

443
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,573
I have no idea

444
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,573
what you're talking about.

445
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,867
Listen to me. Veronica has

446
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,867
a rough family situation,

447
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,952
and she's trying

448
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,952
to improve her life.

449
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,914
And I admire that.

450
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,914
Very inspirational.

451
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,290
Georgie,

452
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,418
believe me, I'm glad

453
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,418
to see you in a church,

454
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,129
but I do not want you taking

455
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,129
advantage of that girl.

456
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:39,551
Taking advantage? Veronica and I

457
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:39,551
are Bible buddies, nothing more.

458
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,637
I'm serious.

459
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,637
Right.

460
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,265
Maybe you should ask yourself

461
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,265
what's in you

462
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,559
that makes you see sin

463
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,559
in the hearts of others.

464
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,977
Okay, now you're pushing it.

465
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:55,066
Lord Jesus, please help

466
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:55,066
my mother with her anger.

467
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,696
Can I get an amen?

468
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,696
No.

469
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,782
Why do we need the camera?

470
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,578
So people in the future can see

471
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,578
your transformation.

472
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,995
(camera beeps)

473
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,289
Where are you going?

474
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,625
To put on a dress

475
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,625
for the future people.

476
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,752
Hello, people of the future.

477
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,795
My name is Missy Cooper and this

478
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,795
is my best friend Celeste.

479
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:20,300
(whispers):

480
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:20,300
She's dating Joey Lawrence.

481
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,761
(sighs)

482
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,391
You want to hang out Saturday?

483
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,769
Can't. I signed up

484
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,769
to get baptized.

485
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,812
Oh, yeah. I've been

486
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,812
meaning to do that.

487
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:37,233
Well, why don't you join me?

488
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:37,233
We could do it together.

489
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,069
Sure. You and me, getting

490
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,069
double dunked. I like it.

491
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,946
Can you imagine afterwards?

492
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,907
All of our sins

493
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,907
will be washed away.

494
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,826
Yeah, and we can start

495
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,826
cranking out fresh ones.

496
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,457
I just don't know

497
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,457
where I went wrong.

498
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,083
Are you sure your questioning

499
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,083
was skillful?

500
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,504
I thought so, but after

501
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,504
two hours of interrogation,

502
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,506
all I could extract

503
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,506
from my sister's brain

504
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,676
was that there was some sort

505
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,676
of block with new kids on it.

506
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,843
Sheldon, how's your

507
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,843
educational project going?

508
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,763
Poorly. I've hit a wall.

509
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,474
Have you considered B.F.

510
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,474
Skinner's behavior modification?

511
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,518
What's that?

512
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,518
It uses punishment

513
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,852
and reward to get

514
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,852
the results you want.

515
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,648
Ooh, punishment.

516
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,648
I like the sound of that.

517
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,110
(quietly):

518
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,110
In the right context, so do I.

519
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,154
I took a real beating

520
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,154
at the craps table,

521
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,199
and then I won it all back

522
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,199
playing Caribbean Stud Poker.

523
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,535
Well, how does

524
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,535
Caribbean Stud Poker work?

525
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,870
I have no idea.

526
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,870
I was drunk off my ass.

527
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,372
(both laugh)

528
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,372
MARY:

529
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,372
Way to go, Mom.

530
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,749
Way to lead a Christian life.

531
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,835
Oh, does my daughter

532
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,835
think poorly of me?

533
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,085
Yes.

534
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,047
Good. I can die happy.

535
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:45,510
Hey, Mom, just a heads-up,

536
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:45,510
I'm getting baptized tomorrow.

537
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,346
Good Lord.

538
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,516
That boy's randiness

539
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,516
knows no bounds.

540
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,767
What are you talking about?

541
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,060
He's only doing it

542
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,436
'cause of that Veronica girl.

543
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,605
Oh, sure. That makes sense.

544
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,273
What do you mean,

545
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,273
it makes sense?

546
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,526
When I was his age,

547
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,526
I hitchhiked to Florida

548
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,695
'cause I had a friend

549
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,695
that had a girlfriend

550
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,946
who knew a girl

551
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,946
who might be willing.

552
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,615
But then you met my daughter

553
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,615
and you didn't have

554
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,701
to travel so far.

555
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,701
(laughs)

556
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,036
(bottles clink)

557
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,998
SHELDON:

558
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,998
According to B.F. Skinner,

559
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,251
if I can find the appropriate

560
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,251
punishment to motivate Missy,

561
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:22,380
there's no limit to what

562
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:22,380
she might be able to learn.

563
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,299
But what might

564
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,299
that punishment be?

565
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,552
Whip her with a rubber hose?

566
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:31,890
No. That sounds like a recipe

567
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:31,890
for tendonitis.

568
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,435
Administer small

569
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,435
electric shocks?

570
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,228
Tricky.

571
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,355
If I get the voltage wrong, I

572
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,355
could spend the rest of my life

573
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,525
in an institution

574
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,525
for the criminally insane.

575
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,029
Or I inflict harm

576
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,742
on the object she loves

577
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,742
more than life itself.

578
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:58,291
Celeste, you're about to become

579
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:58,291
part of scientific history.

580
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,587
All right, everybody,

581
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,587
welcome to the 1990

582
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,130
East Texas Baptist Olympics.

583
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,466
(laughs)

584
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,051
'Cause we're in the pool

585
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,051
of water.

586
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,220
Anyway, I want to welcome

587
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,598
our little sister

588
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,598
Veronica Duncan,

589
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,934
who I will be dunkin'.

590
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,934
(chuckles)

591
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,351
Sorry.

592
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,062
I can't turn it off.

593
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,062
And I also want to welcome

594
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,231
George Cooper,

595
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,231
who has recently found

596
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,858
his way to the Lord.

597
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,985
Howdy. Praise Jesus.

598
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,445
(sighs)

599
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,989
Are you ready to learn

600
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,989
some advanced calculus?

601
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,365
Nope.

602
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,367
Be right back.

603
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,745
Take your time.

604
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:38,038
Veronica, do you trust

605
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:38,038
in Jesus Christ

606
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,708
as your personal

607
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,708
Lord and savior?

608
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,085
(laughs softly):

609
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,085
I do.

610
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,338
JEFF: It's upon

611
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,338
your profession of faith

612
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,715
that I baptize you, my sister,

613
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:53,179
in the name of the Father, the

614
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:53,179
Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

All right, let's

try this again.

625
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,877
Would you be ready to learn

some advanced calculus

627
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,880
if it saved Celeste's pigtails?

628
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,716
What are you doing?

629
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,716
Put her down.

630
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,468

639
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,363

Is it working?

644
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,539
Are you feeling motivated?

645
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,666
Very.

646
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,043
(animal growling)

647
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,506

(all gasping)

649

Care to explain yourself?

650
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,843
I was trying

651
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,843
to motivate Missy

652
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,303
to expand her

653
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,303
intellectual horizons.

654
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,639
By torturing

655
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,639
her Cabbage Patch doll?

656
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,808
Well, it's not like I shocked

657
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,808
her with electrodes,

658
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,602
which was an option.

659
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,602
Enough.

660
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,021
To be clear, I meant to

661
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,021
shock Missy, not the doll.

662
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,272
That would be ineffective.

663
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,232
Enough! And you.

664
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:31,235
Getting baptized just to kiss

665
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:31,235
a girl? What were you thinking?

666
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,780
Sounds like you know

667
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,780
what I was thinking.

668
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:37,116
Well, you are both grounded.

669
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,878
<i>I like you because you're</i>

Ha. What a cutie pie.

683
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,026
Hey, hey, Barbara, we got

any more of those pink T-shirts

Oh, oh, and get me

some chicken nuggets, huh?

690
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:22,536
Hello? Anybody out there?

691
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,082
Apparently not.

692
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,043
Barb!

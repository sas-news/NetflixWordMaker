22
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,993
MR. GIVENS:

23
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,993
All right,

24
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,494
with Thanksgiving

25
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,494
weekend approaching,

26
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,037
it's the perfect

27
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,037
opportunity to observe

28
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:40,833
family dynamics and how

29
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:40,833
our parents, relatives

30
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,001
and siblings affect us.

31
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,335
Now, the...

32
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,044
Yes, Sheldon.

33
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,714
I don't find that interesting.

34
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,549
Well, tough knuckles,

35
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,549
that's the assignment.

36
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,719
Now, you'll all be expected

37
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,719
to collect data on your family,

38
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,221
form a hypothesis,

39
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,221
and make a prediction.

40
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,057
So you're giving us

41
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,057
homework for Thanksgiving?

42
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,142
Yes.

43
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,269
Oh, boy!

came up today

52
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,004
that we need

53
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,004
to talk about.

54
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,004
What's that?

55
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:29,924
I maybe have a shot

56
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:29,924
at a better job.

57
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:33,761
Oh, George, they're finally

58
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:33,761
gonna make you head coach?

59
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,094
Better than that.

60
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,556
Special Teams Coach,

00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,556
University of Tulsa.

62
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,474
In Oklahoma?

63
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,061
That is where they're keeping

64
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,061
Tulsa these days.

65
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,478
No need to be lippy.

66
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,023
You're not seriously

67
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,023
thinking about moving

68
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:48,525
this whole family

69
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:48,525
to Oklahoma, are you?

70
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,611
GEORGE SR.: It's 400 miles away,

71
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,611
I wasn't gonna commute.

00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,279
MARY:

73
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,279
Well, that's not gonna work.

74
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,532
The kids are all settled in

75
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,532
with school and friends,

76
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,492
and I've got my job

77
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,492
at the church,

78
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,869
and then there's Mom.

79
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,788
Am I supposed to just

80
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,788
walk away from her?

81
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,497
GEORGE SR.: No, what

82
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,497
you're supposed to do

83
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,583
is support my efforts

84
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,583
to improve our life.

85
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,051
Notes for

86
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,051
psychology paper.

87
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:15,385
What you doing?

88
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:18,097
Shh. Family conflict

89
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:18,097
has been observed.

90
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,017
Subject M and Subject D have

91
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,017
opposing views on relocating.

92
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,604
You better not be recording

93
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,604
over my Janet Jackson tape.

94
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,314
Would you please?

95
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,108
Who's Subject M and Subject D?

96
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,819
I can't tell you that,

97
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,819
you might skew the results.

98
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,738
Okay, then tell me

99
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,738
what skew means.

100
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,657
Are you going to talk

101
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,657
the whole time?

102
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:40,160
It seems to be annoying you,

103
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:40,160
so, yeah.

104
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,960
Mary, I just can't thank you

105
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,960
enough for inviting me today.

106
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:51,088
You're very welcome, John.

107
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:51,088
Love having you here.

108
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,925
Last Thanksgiving, I just sat

109
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,925
in my apartment all by myself

110
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,927
and ate a turkey sandwich.

111
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,303
That is so sad.

112
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,263
Well, it wasn't

113
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,263
at the time,

114
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,557
but now that I have something

115
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,557
to compare it to,

116
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,184
I realize what

117
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,184
a pathetic loser I was.

118
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,437
You were never a loser.

119
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,898
Yeah, you were.

120
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,067
Hey, Georgie,

121
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,277
you have any sentimental

122
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,277
attachment to this town?

123
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,697
I don't know, why?

124
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,697
I'm just curious if,

125
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,074
you know, we ever did

126
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,074
pick up and live somewhere else,

127
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,408
how you'd feel about it.

128
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,328
Well, if it was Hawaii,

129
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,328
I'd feel pretty great.

130
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,872
That's where they make

131
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,872
<i>Magnum, P.I.</i>

132
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,499
I don't think Hawaii's

133
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,499
in the cards.

134
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,834
How about Miami?

135
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,794
Let me guess,

136
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,794
'cause of<i> Miami Vice?</i>

137
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,462
<i>Golden Girls.</i>

138
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,048
Course.

139
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,465
Car.

140
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,052
I saw this one

141
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,095
where Blanche dates

142
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,095
this little guy

143
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:43,891
who breaks up with her 'cause

144
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:43,891
she's not Jewish. So good.

145
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,435
Forget about Miami

146
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,435
and Hawaii and Blanche.

147
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,189
I mean, how do you feel about

148
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,189
not staying in Medford forever?

149
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,191
Well, I guess

150
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,191
I'd be okay with it.

151
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,109
All right.

152
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,527
Good to know.

153
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,655
Subject D is attempting

154
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,655
to influence Subject G

155
00:03:58,697 --> 00:03:59,948
regarding relocating.

156
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,158
What about you, Sheldon?

157
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,702
What about me what?

158
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,913
Could you ever see yourself

159
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,913
leaving Medford?

160
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,791
I'm sorry, Dad,

161
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,791
but I'm unable to express

162
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,459
an opinion at this time.

163
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,544
Why not?

164
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,254
In the interest of science,

165
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,297
I have to remain

166
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,297
a neutral observer.

167
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,718
Glad I asked.

168
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,387
Hey, fellows, may I join?

169
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,265
Sure. Here you go.

170
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,518
GEORGE JR.:

171
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,518
Dang, nice catch.

172
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,981
SHELDON:

173
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,981
Car.

174
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,027
Listen, I'm gonna need

175
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,027
your help with something.

176
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,862
Is it about money?

177
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,862
No.

178
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,031
Then I'm your gal.

179
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,031
What's up?

180
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:44,201
George is up for a coaching job

181
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:44,201
at the University of Tulsa.

182
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,620
Tulsa? Ugh.

183
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,706
Last year, I lost $800

184
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,706
on that damn team.

185
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,625
I'm sorry to hear that.

186
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,710
I'm fine with most

187
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,710
of the Division I stuff,

188
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,171
but these independent teams,

189
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,757
I j-- I just can't seem

190
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,757
to get a handle on it.

191
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,718
You think if George got that job

192
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,718
he might give me an inside line?

193
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,262
Mom.

194
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,721
Well, I'd cut him in,

195
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,431
make it look like

196
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,431
a Christmas present.

197
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,975
Would you please listen to me?

198
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,268
If we move up there,

199
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,019
other than holidays,

200
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,687
you're not gonna

201
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,687
see your grandkids.

202
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,482
Oh, that's a point.

203
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:18,652
You make it sound like

204
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:18,652
a<i> Sophie's Choice</i> kind of deal.

205
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:22,239
During dinner,

206
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:22,239
maybe you could express

207
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:25,742
how devastating it would be

208
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:25,742
to be away from the kids.

209
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,495
Well, I don't think I'd use

210
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,495
the word "devastating."

211
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,830
That doesn't sound like me.

212
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,666
Okay, well,

213
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,666
use whatever word you want.

214
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:36,711
I might use... "heartbroken."

215
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,588
Good, use that.

216
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,549
Yeah, maybe.

217
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,549
Have you got a thesaurus?

218
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,931
Oh, dear.

219
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,017
Don't be scared, Sheldon,

220
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,017
it's just a parade.

221
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,601
I already

222
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,601
don't like dogs.

223
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,937
Gigantic and floating

224
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,937
does not help.

225
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,982
Hey, how's the parade?

226
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,982
MISSY: Great.

227
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,692
Alf is one of the hosts.

228
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,821
Alf, cool. Hey, so listen,

229
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,199
how attached are you

230
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,199
to living here in Medford?

231
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,574
I don't know

232
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,574
what that means.

233
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,285
If we moved away,

234
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:11,205
do you have really good friends

235
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:11,205
that you'd miss a lot?

236
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,580
I have really

237
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,580
good friends,

238
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,373
but I think they

239
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,373
would mostly miss me.

240
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,210
'Cause you make friends

241
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,210
wherever you go.

242
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,377
I do. People

243
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,377
are drawn to me.

244
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,546
Ugh.

245
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,050
Sorry, I'm neutral.

246
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,844
Okay, so what I'm hearing

247
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,844
is that

248
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,554
you'd be happy no matter

249
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,554
where we lived.

250
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,973
I guess. Dad, please,

251
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,973
I'm trying to watch TV.

252
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,434
Sorry. I'll leave you to it.

253
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,608
Oh dear, Big Bird.

254
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,701
You're making a sandwich?

255
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,536
I'm a creature of habit.

256
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,913
(chuckles)

257
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,956
Hey, why don't we all

258
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,956
go around the table

259
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,958
and say what we're thankful for?

260
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,417
Come on, really?

261
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,711
Yes, really.

262
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,338
I'll start.

263
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,883
I'm thankful to be surrounded

264
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,883
by my loving family.

265
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,551
What about that guy?

266
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,387
That guy--

267
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,387
Dr. Sturgis--

268
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,305
is part of our

269
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,305
extended family.

270
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,973
Mm, thank you.

271
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:15,936
And I'm also thankful

272
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:15,936
for this warm and comfy home

273
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,772
that God has blessed us with

274
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,772
and this great neighborhood

275
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,732
with my mom living

276
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:21,858
right across the street,

277
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,903
and of course

278
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,903
our excellent

279
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,447
school system that

280
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,447
provides our children

281
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,449
with a world-class education.

282
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,492
Missy?

283
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,288
I'm thankful that there's two

284
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,288
different<i> Ghostbuster</i> cartoons.

285
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,496
That's it?

286
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,457
Unless you know

287
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,457
about a third one.

288
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,793
Okay, my turn. (chuckles)

289
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:43,380
Um, I am so thankful

290
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:43,380
to be able to watch

291
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,589
my grandchildren grow up.

292
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,507
And I can't

293
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,507
even tell you

294
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,135
how much it

295
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,135
means to me

296
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,637
that y'all live

297
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,637
right across the street.

298
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,764
And if y'all weren't,

299
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,934
I would just be... heartbroken.

300
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,439
And not just heartbroken--

301
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,608
crestfallen and chagrined.

302
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,277
And, uh,

303
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,861
I'm also thankful

304
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,861
for my health,

305
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,530
that that mole on my hip

306
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,530
turned out to be nothing,

307
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,116
and, uh,

308
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,034
I'm very thankful for John here,

309
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,535
who has

310
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,289
brought so much happiness to me.

311
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,915
(chuckles)

312
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,584
That's it for me.

313
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,421
STURGIS:

314
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,421
Oh, my.

315
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,421
Aw, lovely, Mom.

316
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,131
Oh, my, I don't know

317
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,131
where to begin.

318
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:30,302
Well, first of all,

319
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:30,302
I'm thankful to you, Connie,

320
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:34,847
for how you make me laugh,

321
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:34,847
make me feel cared for,

322
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,808
all the ways you're

323
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,808
affectionate to me

324
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,355
that I can't discuss

325
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,355
in-in front of children

326
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,606
because that would be

327
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,606
inappropriate, right?

328
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,983
Right.

329
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,195
And I'm thankful

330
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,195
to be here

331
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,864
with your wonderful family.

332
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,909
This is something I didn't

333
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,909
experience growing up.

334
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:59,206
See, my father was away

335
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:59,206
a great deal on business

336
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,000
and it was just me and my mother

337
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,504
and she was a cold

338
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,504
and distant woman

339
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,466
who blamed the world

340
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,466
for her club foot.

341
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:10,717
Sweetie.

342
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:10,717
And I...

343
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,093
Wrap it up.

344
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,054
Sorry.

345
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,348
My gratitude

346
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,348
knows no bounds.

347
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,683
Thank you.

348
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,683
Georgie?

349
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,728
Um, I'm thankful for my job

350
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,604
at the auto shop.

351
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,316
Uh, let's see...

352
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,860
Oh, Alyssa Milano

353
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,860
from<i> Who's the Boss?</i>

354
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,989
She's really hot.

355
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,989
Mm... That's about it.

356
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,534
That's wonderful. Shelly?

357
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,869
I'm sorry, Mom, but if

358
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,869
I answer that question,

359
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,080
I'd be violating

360
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,080
my experimental protocol.

361
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,999
Okay, moving on. George?

362
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,501
Well... (clears throat)

363
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,211
I'm thankful to share

364
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,211
Thanksgiving dinner

365
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,213
with my family, of course.

366
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,298
I'm also thankful

367
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,298
for this fine country we live in

368
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,592
and all the opportunities

369
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,592
it provides us.

370
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,428
Especially when

371
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,428
those opportunities

372
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,472
come once in a lifetime

373
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,472
and require taking a small risk

374
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,766
and believing in one another.

375
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,269
We're really gonna do this now?

376
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,439
Hey, you started it with

377
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,439
all that school system crap.

378
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,774
I only did that

379
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,774
because you've been

380
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,692
trying to twist

381
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,692
the kids' heads around.

382
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,570
All right, who talked?

383
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,654
Who do you think?

384
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,654
Missy.

385
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,073
Yup.

386
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,700
Well, it doesn't matter

387
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,700
because you obviously

388
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,370
went to your mother and made her

389
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,370
your stalking horse.

390
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,788
Of course

391
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,788
she went to me.

392
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,458
Move to Oklahoma,

393
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,458
what's wrong with you?

394
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,126
Wait, we're moving

395
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,126
to Oklahoma?

396
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,211
I thought Texans

397
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,211
don't like Oklahoma.

398
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,921
You're damn right we don't.

399
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,881
What's wrong with Oklahoma?

400
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,881
I'll tell you later.

401
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:34,259
Okay, that's enough of this.

402
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:34,259
Nobody's moving anywhere.

403
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,761
Let's just have

404
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,761
a nice, quiet dinner.

405
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,348
That's it? Y-You're gonna

406
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,348
make the decision for me?

407
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,808
I'm making a decision for us.

408
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,018
All right, then.

409
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,312
Where are you going?

410
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,563
George.

411
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:47,981

416
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:06,082

Difficult day.

427
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,737
Yes.

428
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,617
Psychology? Is that a

429
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,617
new interest of yours?

430
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:43,662
It was either this

431
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:43,662
or milking cows.

432
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:43,662
Oh.

433
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:46,789
I once was

434
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:46,789
licked by a cow.

435
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,375
You made the

436
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,375
right choice.

437
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,001
I'm not so sure.

438
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,419
Why is that?

439
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,755
Well, I was supposed

440
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,755
to observe family dynamics

441
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,091
over Thanksgiving

442
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,091
for my hypothesis,

443
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,301
then make a prediction.

444
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:01,346
Oh. All right.

445
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,806
So, um, what

446
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,806
did you observe?

447
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,893
My mom and dad arguing

448
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,893
over moving to Oklahoma

449
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,144
for my dad's job.

450
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,771
I would concur with

451
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,771
that observation.

452
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,568
Now, can you form a

453
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,568
hypothesis based on that?

454
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:18,572
Well, their marriage

455
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:18,572
is a zero sum game.

456
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,906
What's good for my father

457
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,908
isn't good for my mother

458
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,908
and vice versa.

459
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,243
Excellent.

460
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,452
And your prediction?

461
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,913
Well, based on

462
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,913
previous arguments

463
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,998
I've observed,

464
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,998
my father will try

465
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,458
to reassert his dominance

466
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,586
by making a meaningless

467
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,586
symbolic gesture.

468
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,714
Really? That seems

469
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,714
a bit of a stretch.

00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,145
the Thanksgiving weekend

559
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,814

561
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:00,233
I observed my father

565
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,572

566
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,572
economic advancement

567
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,616

568
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,616

where she will

583
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,760
constantly disapprove

584
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:30,764
of my hot, blonde,

585
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:30,764
American wife.

586
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,061
Okay. Uh, I think we all

587
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,061
learned something there.

588
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,312
Uh, thank you, Tam.

589
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,314
Uh, Mr. Cooper,

590
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,314
you're up.

591
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,779
(clears throat)

592
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,989
Beginning on Wednesday night,

593
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,989
I observed my parents

594
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,535
arguing over the possibility

595
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,535
of us moving to Tulsa, Oklahoma.

596
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,871
Ugh, Oklahoma.

597
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:57,457
The argument escalated

598
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:57,457
and then my father stormed out

599
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,960
and bought a Fiero.

600
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,712
(voice breaking):

601
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,712
And then I went to my Meemaw's

602
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,255
and slept in my underwear!

603
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,674
(sobbing)

604
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:07,967
(door opens)

605
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,387
That's it; I've wasted my life.

606
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,890
(music plays quietly on radio)

607
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,310
You want to tell

608
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,310
me what happened?

609
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,228
Instead of remaining

610
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,228
a neutral observer,

611
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,189
I got emotional in front

612
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,189
of the whole class.

613
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,441
Well, that's

614
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,441
not a big deal.

615
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,652
Yes, it is; I'm a scientist.

616
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,112
You never hear about Newton

617
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,112
crying like a baby

618
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,156
when he got brutalized

619
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,156
by an apple.

620
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,325
I think you're being

621
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,325
a little tough on yourself.

622
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:36,120
I wonder why this

623
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:36,120
is affecting me so much.

624
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,749
Well, maybe it has something

625
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,749
to do with your parents arguing.

626
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,460
Us moving? I don't think so.

627
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,921
Texas, Oklahoma...

628
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,921
what's the difference?

629
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,590
Hey, now, I think you

630
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,590
might want to crack open

631
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:51,177
your psychology textbook

632
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:51,177
'cause that there is crazy talk.

633
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:55,014
I did read a chapter

634
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:55,014
on repressing emotions.

635
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,809
I suppose I could've been

636
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,809
doing that to avoid dealing

637
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,519
with the fear of change,

638
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,146
and moving would certainly

639
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,146
be a big change.

640
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,816
That's very astute.

641
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,816
I'd have a new room,

642
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,818
in a new house,

643
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,444
and the new house would probably

644
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,444
have a different smell,

645
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,238
and I probably

646
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,238
wouldn't like that smell

647
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,991
because I don't like new smells,

648
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:16,076
and I'd be going to a new school

649
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:16,076
with new kids and new teachers,

650
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:17,912
and I bet they'd all

651
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:17,912
smell different, as well.

652
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,204
Okay, now calm down.

653
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,915
That's easy for you to say.

654
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,291
Your olfactory senses

655
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,291
aren't about to be assaulted

656
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,669
by the state of Oklahoma.

657
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,796
Okay, let's try

658
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,796
a different approach.

659
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,298
Can I take you

660
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,298
to get some ice cream?

661
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,218
I'm having an emotional

662
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,218
crisis, Meemaw!

663
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,261
You can't fix that

664
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,261
with ice cream.

665
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,015
Right. Sorry.

666
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,435
You want to go

667
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,435
to Radio Shack?

668
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,063
Yes, I want to go

669
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,063
to Radio Shack!

670
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,404
Well, sir, that's the tour.

671
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,574
What do you think,

672
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,574
nicer than East Texas?

673
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,200
(chuckles) Very impressive.

674
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,036
Not sure how

675
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,036
you did it,

676
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,454
but that is the least disgusting

677
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,454
locker room I've ever been in.

678
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,706
Yes, sir.

679
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,499
Every bit of it's

680
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,499
brand, spanking new.

681
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,085
I bet if you had to, you could

682
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,085
even eat lunch in there.

683
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,047
(laughs) So what

684
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,047
do you say, George?

685
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,298
I could sure use a man

686
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,298
with your track record

687
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,885
to coach special teams. Please.

688
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:18,014
Thank you. I got to say,

689
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:18,014
I'm real tempted.

690
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,891
How does the family feel

691
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,891
about relocating?

692
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:24,144
Oh, they're all pretty excited

693
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:24,144
about the opportunity.

694
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,814
The kids see it as an adventure.

695
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:31,235
So why am I feeling like

696
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:31,235
you got some hesitation?

697
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,486
If it's about the money,

698
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,447
I believe I can get you

699
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,447
some more money.

700
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,991
No, no, no, the money's good.

701
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,118
Well, that's it, then.

702
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,118
You're gonna fit in perfectly

703
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,620
with our program here.

704
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,705
We got a lovely little house

705
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,705
for you and your family,

706
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:43,915
and best of all,

707
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,166
you're gonna be out of Texas.

708
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,166
(laughs)

709
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,586
I thought you started out

710
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,586
in Houston?

711
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:52,214
Shh. I'm trying

712
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:52,214
to fit in around here.

713
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,259
(both laugh)

714
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,386
So we have a deal?

715
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,890
(sighs)

716
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,538
What happened?

717
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,085
Can I take my coat off?

718
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,544
No. What happened?

719
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,380
(sighs) I turned it down.

720
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,590
Why?

721
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,676
'Cause you're

722
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,676
afraid of Mom?

723
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,178
'Cause I don't want to live

724
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,178
in Oklahoma.

725
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,429
George.

726
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,348
What difference

727
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,348
does it make, Mare?

728
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,641
We're not moving.

729
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,395
ADULT SHELDON:<i> As a child,</i>

730
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,395
<i>I never understood</i>

731
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,649
<i>the sacrifices my father made</i>

732
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,649
<i>for his family's happiness,</i>

733
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,818
<i>which made me somewhat</i>

734
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,818
<i>less compassionate</i>

735
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,111
<i>than I should've been.</i>

736
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,821
SHELDON:

737
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,821
Yay! We're not moving!

738
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,739
MISSY:

739
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,739
We're staying in Texas!

740
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,783
(all cheering, laughing)

741
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,374
MEEMAW:<i> John?</i>

742
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,374
STURGIS:<i> Yes?</i>

743
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:13,212
Could we do it

744
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:13,212
just one more time?

745
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:16,382
Really? I don't want you

746
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:16,382
to get tired of it.

747
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:21,179
I won't. Please?

748
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,639
Well, I can't say no to you.

749
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,142
(both chuckle)

750
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:29,062
Fire in the hole.

751
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:33,232
(laughs) Unbelievable.

752
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,403
Again, again.

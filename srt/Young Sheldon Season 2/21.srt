00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:03,337
ADULT SHELDON:<i> A few times a</i>

2
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:03,337
<i>year, there was a dedicated day</i>

3
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,255
<i>where my school was closed.</i>

4
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:06,882
<i>This allowed</i>

5
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:06,882
<i>the teachers to catch up</i>

6
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,467
<i>on their administrative duties.</i>

7
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,219
<i>While I was normally against</i>

8
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,219
<i>a break from learning,</i>

9
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:14,264
<i>I did applaud the Medford</i>

10
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:14,264
<i>faculty's commitment</i>

11
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,308
<i>to our education.</i>

12
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,308
Oh, man.

13
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,353
How great is this place

14
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,353
without kids in it?

15
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,353
(laughs): I heard that.

16
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:22,147
ADULT SHELDON:<i> On one of those</i>

17
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:22,147
<i>days, I got to spend time</i>

18
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,565
<i>with my mom at her job.</i>

19
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:24,650
SHELDON:

20
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:24,650
Did you write that?

21
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,777
You betcha.

22
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,777
Instead of puns,

23
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:29,697
have you considered composing

24
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:29,697
a humorous palindrome?

25
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,950
It's a phrase that reads

26
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,950
the same backwards as forwards.

27
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:35,703
For example, "Do geese see God?"

28
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,831
Trust me. Both ways.

29
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:41,082
Come inside.

30
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:44,628
SHELDON: Some other good ones

31
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:44,628
are radar, level, kayak.

32
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,630
That's a funny word. Kayak.

33
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,256
Never get me in one.

34
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,676
So what's the plan?

35
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,093
How will I be entertained

36
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,093
all day?

37
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,304
I thought you could be

38
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,304
my little helper.

39
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:57,349
I prefer executive assistant.

40
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:57,349
Carries more weight.

41
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,686
Fine. You stay here, I'm gonna

42
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,686
go talk to Pastor Jeff.

43
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:01,937
Mom.

44
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,146
What?

45
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,149
"Mom" is also

46
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,149
a palindrome. M-O-M.

47
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,864
Good morning, Peg.

48
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:14,909
Any morning you wake up

49
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:14,909
is a good morning. (coughs)

50
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,911
Okay.

51
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,412
(wheezing)

52
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,163
(knocking on door)

53
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,163
Come in.

54
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,875
Good morn-- oh,

55
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,875
it's dark in here.

56
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,418
Uh-huh.

57
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,420
Everything okay?

58
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,463
Mm-hmm.

59
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,466
I need you to use your words.

60
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,387
My marriage is over.

61
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,764

in the same bed anymore.

72
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,542
In the '50s,

73
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,542
people had separate beds.

74
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,753
Lucy and Ricky did it.

75
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,753
Their marriage worked.

76
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:13,050
I-I'm sure

77
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:13,050
it's just a rough patch.

78
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:15,343
Boy, I hope so.

79
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,055
Well, if there's any way

80
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,055
I can make your life easier,

81
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:19,389
you let me know.

82
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,517
Thank you, Mary.

83
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,517
I really appreciate it.

84
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,982
Oh, I almost forgot, um,

85
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,982
Sheldon's here with me today.

86
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,150
Great.

87
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,375
Hey, little man. How you doing?

88
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,419
You smell like cigarettes.

89
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,421
You're fun.

90
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,965
Do you know what this binder is?

91
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:56,969
It's a record of donations

92
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:56,969
people make to the church.

93
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,054
This data could

94
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,054
easily be transferred

95
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,514
into a computerized spreadsheet.

96
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,640
Why isn't it?

97
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,058
No idea.

98
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,227
You also smell

99
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,227
like mothballs and Ben-Gay.

100
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,648
Bye.

101
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,612
I hope you don't mind, I invited

102
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,612
Pastor Jeff for dinner.

103
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:16,780
That's fine.

104
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,197
I was talking to your father.

105
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,449
What's the occasion?

106
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:22,494
No occasion,

107
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:22,494
just thought it'd be nice.

108
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,912
His wife coming, too?

109
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,956
No. Just him.

110
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,206
They having problems?

111
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,208
He's just coming to dinner.

112
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,208
That's all.

113
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,836
You two having problems?

114
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:31,920
Are we?

115
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:32,963
No.

116
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,131
Pastor Jeff's wife

117
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:35,757
is so much prettier than him.

118
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,926
It's like Barbie

119
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,926
married a turtle.

120
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,470
Hey. Here's a fun idea:

121
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,139
how about you and Sheldon

122
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,139
have dinner

123
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,224
at Meemaw's tonight?

124
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,224
All right.

125
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,643
(quietly): They<i> are</i> a

126
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,643
weird-looking couple.

127
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,269
You want to eat

128
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,269
at my mom's, too?

129
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,438
Oh, come on. You got eyes.

130
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,112
Pastor, would you like

131
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,112
to lead us in grace?

132
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,740
I'd be honored.

133
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,826
Heavenly Father,

134
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,826
thank you for this food.

135
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,787
I pray that it nourishes

136
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,787
and strengthens us,

137
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,122
and bless Mary for preparing it.

138
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,583
(crying):

139
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,583
And thank you

140
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,583
for the Coopers

141
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:14,421
who have invited me

142
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:14,421
into their loving home.

143
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,464
They are

144
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,464
a shining example

145
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,928
of what a marriage can be.

146
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:25,348
One that I hope

147
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:25,348
to have again someday.

148
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,309
Amen.

149
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,309
And please give

150
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,309
me the strength...

151
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,519
(whispers):

152
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,519
Sorry.

153
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,813
The strength to walk this road

154
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:36,735
with unconditional love

155
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:36,735
and joy in my heart.

156
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,736
Amen.

157
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:38,904
Amen.

158
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:38,904
Amen.

159
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,906
(sniffles)

160
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,076
Well, let's eat!

161
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,122
Cheers.

162
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,122
Cheers.

163
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,124
Cheers.

164
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,124
Cheers.

165
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,918
Dang, this place is nice.

166
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,879
That's because it was

167
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,879
supposed to be a date.

168
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,006
Cool. My first date.

169
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,967
Meemaw, I've been going through

170
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,967
the church records,

171
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,761
and I noticed you haven't made

172
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,761
a donation in quite a long time.

173
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,930
Why are you going

174
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,930
through the records?

175
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,015
I'm an executive assistant.

176
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,642
Good for you.

177
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,642
MEEMAW:

178
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,642
You see,

179
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,436
God and I have a deal. And

180
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,436
when he helps me win big

181
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,605
at the casino,

182
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,605
I give him a cut.

183
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,315
And lately, he has

184
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,315
not been holding up

185
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,733
his part of the bargain.

186
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,612
"Steak<i> aw poyver</i> with<i> fritties"?</i>

187
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,363
It's French.

188
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,363
Oh.

189
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,865
What's a crock monster?

190
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,575
It's croque monsieur,

191
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:29,412
and it's really just a grilled

192
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:29,412
cheese sandwich with ham.

193
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,123
I want that.

194
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:34,375
(chokes) There's

195
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:34,375
lemon in this water.

196
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:45,553
So, uh, who do you

197
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:45,553
think the Oilers

198
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,014
are gonna take in the draft?

199
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,683
Oh, I don't

200
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,683
really follow sports.

201
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,186
I'm just gonna eat.

202
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,645
(door opens)

203
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,317
What's he doing here?

204
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,317
Y'all getting a divorce?

205
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:01,278
No. No, he's just

206
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:01,278
here for dinner.

207
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,531
Oh. Welcome, Your Holiness.

208
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:08,160
I thought you were hanging

209
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:08,160
out with Veronica tonight.

210
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,704
We were supposed to,

211
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,704
but then she invited a bunch

212
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,331
of her choir friends over,

213
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,499
and it turned

214
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,499
into a stupid Bible study.

215
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,501
No offense.

216
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,501
None taken.

217
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,878
Hmm.

218
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,878
GEORGE JR.:

219
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,878
Honestly,

220
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,880
I do not understand

221
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,880
the female mind.

222
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,715
(quietly):

223
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,715
Do something.

224
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,218
Georgie, why don't you go eat

225
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,218
dinner in front of the TV?

226
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,179
No, it's all right. Sounds like

227
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,179
Georgie's having trouble

228
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,056
navigating the perilous waters

229
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,598
of a relationship.

230
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,684
Believe me, I can understand.

231
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,478
You having problems

232
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,478
with your hot wife?

233
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,317
Maybe<i> I'll</i> go eat by the TV.

234
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,614
I'm liking my crock monster.

235
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,075
Mmm. Me, too.

236
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,244
I can't taste anything

237
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,244
after the lemon water.

238
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,411
I'm glad y'all

239
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,411
are having a good time.

240
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,496
You're welcome.

241
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,123
Where we having dinner tomorrow?

242
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,958
Nowhere.

243
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,794
Dr. Sturgis and I are going to

244
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,794
Louisiana, do a little gambling.

245
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,214
So a donation could

246
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,214
be forthcoming?

247
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,590
Don't jinx me.

248
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,801
It's my first time

249
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,801
going to a casino.

250
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,180
It's amazing. There's bright

251
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,180
lights and bells and buzzers

252
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:11,306
and people yelling.

253
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,267
BOTH:

254
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,267
Ugh.

255
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,063
Veronica says

256
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,063
I'm the nicest guy she knows.

257
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,065
She also says she only wants

258
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,065
to date nice guys.

259
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,650
Does that mean

260
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,650
she wants to date me?

261
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,650
I bet she doesn't.

262
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,070
No, she does not.

263
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,070
Doesn't make any sense.

264
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,863
Nothing they do

265
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,863
makes any sense.

266
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,824
GEORGE JR.: I know...

267
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,824
At least

268
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,824
he's not crying anymore.

269
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,285
JEFF: Devil's got

270
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,285
something to do with it.

271
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,333
Mary, George, I can't

272
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,333
thank you enough for this.

273
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,709
It was our pleasure.

274
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,587
So, Pastor, are you gonna try

275
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,756
and talk things out with Selena?

276
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,967
Well, we're really

277
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,967
not on speaking terms,

278
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,053
so I'll just be heading back to

279
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,053
my office, sleep on the couch.

280
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,889
That's ridiculous.

281
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,889
He can stay with us, can't he?

282
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,850
Uh, I guess that'd be okay.

283
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,603
Of course it would.

284
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,603
JEFF: Oh.

285
00:07:58,645 --> 00:07:59,896
I couldn't possibly impose.

286
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,189
GEORGE JR.:

287
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,189
Sure you could.

288
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,817
In fact, you can take my room.

289
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,987
Well, y'all are too kind.

290
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,280
(door opens)

291
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,073
Hello.

292
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,073
Oh.

293
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,491
Did y'all

294
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,491
have a good time?

295
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,327
Yes.

296
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,327
It was great.

297
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,495
Oh, Mom, Pastor Jeff is

298
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,495
gonna be spending the night.

299
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,414
If the kids could

300
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,414
sleep at your place?

301
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:19,499
No. Bye.

302
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,261
(whispering):

303
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,261
George.

304
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,429
(snorts)

305
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,429
What? What's wrong?

306
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:35,807
The pastor's up making tea.

307
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,933
What, you want me to blow on it?

308
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,769
Go talk to him.

309
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,104
About what?

310
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,063
(exhales)

311
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,063
I don't know.

312
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,108
Maybe you could give him

313
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,108
a male perspective

314
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,401
on relationship issues.

315
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,112
How about this?

316
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,991
What if I close my eyes

317
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,991
and pray on it?

318
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,202
Hey.

319
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,996
Oh, hi. I hope

320
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,996
I didn't wake you.

321
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,958
Uh, no, no.

322
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,958
Just... get-getting some water.

323
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,626
(clears throat)

324
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,713
Can I fix you some chamomile?

325
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,257
No, thanks.

326
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,388
(sighs)

327
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,388
So...

328
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,309
Tough times, huh?

329
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,727
Yeah.

330
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,437
Yeah.

331
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,202
Hey, uh,

332
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,202
does the Bible say anything

333
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,120
about heartache and such?

334
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,749
Psalm 147, verse three:

335
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,749
"The Lord healeth

336
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,419
the broken in heart,

337
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,419
and bindeth up their wounds."

338
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,004
Well, there you go-eth.

339
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,006
Except I'm feeling kicked

340
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,006
in the nethers right now,

341
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,717
and he sure is taking

342
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,717
his sweet time with the healing.

343
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,970
He takes his sweet time

344
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,970
about a lot of things.

345
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,765
Uh, not that I'm complaining.

346
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,768
You know, his will, not mine,

347
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,768
et cetera.

348
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,978
(clears throat)

349
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,693
You know, one thing

350
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,693
I can say is that

351
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:15,031
having a happy marriage

352
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:15,031
is-- it's hard work.

353
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,325
Oh, I know. (chuckles)

354
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,325
As the pastor, people come to me

355
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,536
with relationship problems

356
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,536
all the time.

357
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:22,163
(chuckles) Bet you hear

358
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:22,163
some juicy ones, huh?

359
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,165
"Juicy" doesn't begin

360
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,165
to describe it.

361
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,168
Oh... give me a sample.

362
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,168
I can't.

363
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,422
There's strict pastor-flock

364
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,422
confidentiality.

365
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,257
Sure. Sure.

366
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,551
Mm.

367
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,551
(exhales)

368
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,930
Mary doesn't tell you

369
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,930
things about us, does she?

370
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,766
I'm... not at liberty to say.

371
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,935
But she does, doesn't she?

372
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,729
Yeah.

373
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,729
Yeah.

374
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,406
These people clearly don't know

375
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,406
what ten percent means.

376
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:57,991
What are you talking about?

377
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,118
This is the list

378
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,118
of all the people who belong

379
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,245
to the church

380
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,245
and how much money they donate.

381
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,705
Dorothy and Fred Nelson

382
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,705
gave a dollar last week.

383
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,501
So?

384
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,501
They own the Piggly Wiggly.

385
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,210
They can afford

386
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,210
to give much more.

387
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,711
Weird.

388
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,548
You say "Piggly Wiggly"

389
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,548
and suddenly I'm hungry.

390
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,177
Really?

391
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,803
You're drinking

392
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,803
in the morning now?

393
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,598
What? Oh, look at that.

394
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,350
Felt later.

395
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,143
Hey, I haven't seen the pastor.

396
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,143
He go home?

397
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,937
He hasn't come out

398
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,937
of Georgie's room.

399
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,524
Maybe he found

400
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,524
Georgie's magazines.

401
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,817
He's a man of God.

402
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,236
You're adorable.

403
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,452
(indistinct chatter)

404
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,412
I have stories.

405
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,412
Come back here.

406
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,040
It's my favorite table.

407
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,040
Oh, hey, Connie.

408
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,375
Hi, Felicia.

409
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,876
Chip me for a deuce.

410
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,212
How's your daughter doing?

411
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,505
Oh, surgery went great.

412
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:54,673
Thanks for asking.

413
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,424
Her daughter got

414
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,424
kicked by a horse.

415
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,135
They had to pin a

416
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,135
couple of bones together.

417
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,135
Oh, my.

418
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,970
She won't be stealing

419
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,970
any more horses

420
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,263
for a little while.

421
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,263
(laughs)

422
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,307
Your usual, Connie?

423
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,307
Yeah.

424
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,434
John, you want something?

425
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,311
I would like a Fresca, please.

426
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,937
Got it, hon.

427
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,937
MAN:

428
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,937
Connie.

429
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,857
Duke-North Carolina's

430
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,857
about to start. Want a piece?

431
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,318
Yeah, baby. Give me the

432
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,318
points on Duke for a nickel.

433
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,237
All right.

434
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,237
(laughing): A nickel.

435
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,572
That's a silly bet.

436
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,989
It's 50 bucks.

437
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,825
A thousand nickels.

438
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,825
Less silly.

439
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,412
I must say, uh...

440
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,540
this is a side of you

441
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,540
I've never... seen before.

442
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,250
You're all right with it,

443
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,250
aren't you?

444
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,626
Oh, sure.

445
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,504
When are you gonna

446
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,504
give that man your $50?

447
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,755
Don't worry

448
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,755
about it. Hit me.

449
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,425
I'm a little worried.

450
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,176
(coins jangling, people cheer)

451
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,514
Pastor Jeff?

452
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,558
Everything all right in there?

453
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,309
Oh, yeah.

454
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,395
I've just been praying,

455
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,395
napping, crying.

456
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,979
I like to mix it up.

457
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,065
Well, how's it going?

458
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,983
Good, actually.

459
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,279
I have this feeling inside

460
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,279
that I should head home.

461
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,866
Well, then you got to honor

462
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,866
that feeling, that's God.

463
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,453
You're right. You

464
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,453
want to come with?

465
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,162
Do you really want me there

466
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,164
while you patch things up

467
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,164
with your wife?

468
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,126
She's less likely to throw any

469
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,126
steak knives if we have company.

470
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:18,089
Um... if you think

471
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:18,089
it'll help, I suppose...

472
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,507
Great, let's hit it.

473
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,594
Oh...

474
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,096
Hello, is this

475
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,096
the Nelson residence?

476
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,641
Oh, good. I'm

477
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,641
Sheldon Cooper,

478
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,142
the executive

479
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,142
assistant secretary

480
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,269
at the First Baptist

481
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,269
Church of Medford.

482
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,979
I'm looking through

483
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,979
our donation records,

484
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,022
and I've noticed that

485
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,022
you've tapered off a bit.

486
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,569
Well, yes, your children's

487
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,569
education is expensive,

488
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,195
but so is running a church.

489
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,821
Oh, boy!

490
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:46,200
I'll be sure to tell

491
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:46,200
the pastor. Goodbye.

492
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:52,666
That earned a sip of Yoo-hoo.

493
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,833
Okay. Who's next?

494
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,337
Wendy and Bill Mackenzie.

495
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,046
Of Mackenzie Chevrolet?

496
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,716
Now those are what we call

497
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,716
"deep pockets."

498
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:05,886
Pat here, double the ten,

499
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:05,886
and split the aces.

500
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,221
Connie...

501
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,475
I found an old-fashioned

502
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,475
malt shop where we can

503
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,770
have milkshakes and

504
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,770
listen to the jukebox,

505
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,229
like I never did

506
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,229
in high school.

507
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,607
Yeah, great.

508
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,607
Not now, John.

509
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,151
Okay, well, I was just hoping

510
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,151
we could do something together.

511
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,655
For God's sake, John. I'm

512
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,655
getting my ass kicked here!

513
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,407
I'm sorry.

514
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:34,040
Oh, Felicia,

515
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:34,040
you're killing me.

516
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,709
(sighs)

517
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,044
Chip me another deuce.

518
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,755
(door opens)

519
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,012
Hello?

520
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,472
Selena?

521
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,351
Ooh. Big TV, fancy.

522
00:14:56,563 --> 00:15:00,608
(reading in Spanish)

523
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,530
<i>"Con amor,</i> Selena."

524
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,031
Which means?

525
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:11,452
"Life is too short to be

526
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:11,452
married to a loser.

527
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,538
"I'm leaving you.

528
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,498
Love, Selena."

529
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,542
"Love, Selena"?

530
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,461
Well, that's kind

531
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,461
of a mixed message.

532
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,461
Yeah.

533
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,593
Oh, I couldn't tell you

534
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,593
how much to give.

535
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,803
But I can tell you

536
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,803
the Stuckeys stepped up

537
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,930
for a thousand dollars.

538
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:34,851
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

539
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:37,771
Well, you need to give what's

540
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:37,771
comfortable for you.

541
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,689
And of course, I don't need

542
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,689
to remind you,

543
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,816
it's entirely tax deductible.

544
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,154
And at the next

545
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,154
pancake breakfast,

546
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,156
you can hold

547
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,156
your head high.

548
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,244
Thank you. That's

549
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,244
very generous.

550
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,454
Goodbye.

551
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,291
The pancake line

552
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,291
closed it.

553
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,710
We are so going

554
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,710
to heaven.

555
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,254
I don't understand why

556
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,254
God would tell me to go home

557
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,131
just to find out

558
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,131
my wife left me.

559
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,383
Not that he needs me

560
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,383
to defend him,

561
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,303
but in God's defense,

562
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,303
he didn't say she'd be there.

563
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,807
Mary, I hate to say this,

564
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,807
but I think it's time

565
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,266
for me to move on.

566
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,226
I thought even as a

567
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,226
teenager, I'd been called

568
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:21,147
to preach the word of God,

569
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:21,147
but maybe that was just my ego.

570
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,023
Maybe I'm not meant to do this.

571
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,945
Don't say that.

572
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,945
You're a great preacher.

573
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,945
Thank you.

574
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,739
But it's clear. I need

575
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,739
to trod a new path.

576
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:33,451
Well, what would you do?

577
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:33,451
Trodding wise.

578
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,077
I don't know.

579
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,789
Maybe work with my hands

580
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,789
amongst men, on an oil rig,

581
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,290
or a fishing trawler.

582
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,794
I also know how

583
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,794
to blow glass.

584
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,212
I could turn a pretty

585
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,212
penny at swap meets.

586
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:49,843
Those all sound

587
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:49,843
like solid options.

588
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:49,843
Mm-hmm.

589
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,094
Oh, red light, red light!

590
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,431
(horn blaring)

591
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,266
(siren wailing)

592
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,192
Oh, phooey.

593
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,694
Tell you what, Jody.

594
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:10,279
Why don't you go upstairs

595
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:10,279
to your daddy's bedroom,

596
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,156
and see how much

597
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,156
is in his wallet?

598
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,493
Don't worry, it's not

599
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,493
stealing if it's for God.

600
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,873
What are y'all up to?

601
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,873
Just helping Mom with

602
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,873
some church work.

603
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,666
Well, aren't you two great kids.

604
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,544
We like to think so.

605
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,086
(chuckles)

606
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:29,007
Really? That much?

607
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,052
(coins jangling)

608
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,937
I think I need

609
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,937
to apologize.

610
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:46,065
I know you do.

611
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:46,065
I'm very sorry.

612
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,817
Sometimes when things

613
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,817
aren't going my way,

614
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,235
I just get

615
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,235
a little cranky.

616
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,405
May I ask you

617
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,405
a personal question?

618
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,405
Sure.

619
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,950
Does your gambling

620
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,950
constitute a problem?

621
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,704
Not today. Bam!

622
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:00,955
(both laughing)

623
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,623
Come on. Let me

624
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,623
take you out to dinner.

625
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:03,917
(whooping)

626
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:03,917
(chuckling)

627
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,294
Don't forget that

628
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,294
you promised Sheldon

629
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,422
if you won,

630
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,422
you'd donate to the church.

631
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,257
You want to see me

632
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,257
get cranky again?

633
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,844
No, I don't.

634
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,844
Well, let's go strap on

635
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,844
some bibs and eat lobster.

636
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,262
Whoa!

637
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,139
So you're over at First

638
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,139
Baptist Church, huh?

639
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,182
Yes, Officer.

640
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,559
I'm new in this area.

641
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,143
I've been looking

642
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,143
for a church.

643
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,480
Well, you're in luck.

644
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,480
It's a wonderful congregation,

645
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,233
and this man right here

646
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,233
is our beloved pastor.

647
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,987
Oh. Are you his wife?

648
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,198
Oh, no, I'm church secretary.

649
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,198
He's actually single.

650
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,868
Well, technically...

651
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,868
He's single.

652
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,162
Well, I'll try

653
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,162
to come by sometime.

654
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,415
Tomorrow's Sunday.

655
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,415
He'll be speaking.

656
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,418
All right. Maybe I'll

657
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,418
see y'all tomorrow.

658
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,923
You have a nice day.

659
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,883
Aren't you gonna

660
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,883
give me a ticket?

661
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,510
Do you<i> want</i> a ticket?

662
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,221
He does not.

663
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,221
Thank you, Officer.

664
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,016
(chuckles)

665
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,062
Pastor?

666
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,062
Yeah?

667
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,730
You were saying

668
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,730
you don't understand

669
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,817
why God told you to go home.

670
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,817
You get it now?

671
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,693
Think I do.

672
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,992
Welcome, church.

673
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,493
I pray you all had a blessed

674
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,493
and prosperous week.

675
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,536
I'm excited to

676
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,246
share with you

677
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,958
what the Lord put on

678
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,958
my heart for today.

679
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,835
I'm surprised you're here

680
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,835
this morning.

681
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,879
Hey. I got to

682
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,879
support my pal.

683
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,423
The renewal of faith

684
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,423
is something that happens

685
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,092
over and over.

686
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:40,054
When you have faith...

687
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:40,054
You need to move

688
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:40,054
fast, Officer.

689
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,140
He's not gonna be on

690
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,140
the market for long.

691
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,767
Roger that.

692
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,767
JEFF: For so many months,

693
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,061
our little parish

694
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,061
has been struggling financially.

695
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,605
But by the grace of God

696
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,605
and his provision,

697
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:53,067
we have received the most

698
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:53,067
donations in church history!

699
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,569
Praise Jesus!

700
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,698
ALL: Praise Jesus!

701
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,698
(applause)

702
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,534
So it's all Jesus, we

703
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,534
don't get any credit?

704
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,662
We need to start

705
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,662
our own church.

706
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,662
They don't pay taxes.

707
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,289
It's a very sound

708
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,289
business model.

709
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,583
JEFF:<i> Say amen</i>

710
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,583
<i>when you get there, huh?</i>

00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,924
-Ah!
-[woman] She looks excited!

2
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:11,052
I'm so excited because I love mess.

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:14,347
[man] It's a never ending battle
to fight the clutter.

4
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,349
-[knocking]
-Oh!

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,019
I want things to be more simple.
I don't know how to fix it.

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,438
With the baby coming,
it's gonna be more chaos.

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,314
-[clattering]
-[gasping, squealing]

8
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,567
[man] Oh, my God! We have too much stuff!

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,028
Hello, I'm Marie Kondo.

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,279
[in Japanese] My mission

11
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,741
is to spark joy in the world
through cleaning.

12
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:33,950
Ching!

13
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,995
[narrator] <i>Best-selling author</i>
<i>and world-renowned tidying expert</i>

14
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:41,583
<i>Marie Kondo is dedicated to inspiring</i>
<i>the world to choose joy</i>

15
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,334
<i>with the KonMari Method.</i>

16
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,253
[in Japanese]
A feature of the KonMari Method

17
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:48,256
<i>is that you clean by item</i>
<i>and not by location.</i>

18
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:51,718
And we will always clean using
the same categories.

19
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,386
[in English] First, is clothing.

20
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,096
-[Marie grunting]
-[laughter]

21
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,264
I can't reach.

22
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,849
Next, is books.

23
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,852
[Iida] Giving them a little shake
and wake them up.

24
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,479
Then, paper.

25
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,438
[man sighs] I can't do the papers.

26
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,690
[deep groan]

27
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,027
The largest category is <i>komono.</i>

28
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,614
<i>Komono </i>is kitchen, bathroom,

29
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,740
and garage.

30
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,868
Everything miscellaneous.

31
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,163
Finally, sentimental items.

32
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,999
It's kinda hard to let it go,
'cause I really like this one.

33
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,212
[sniffling] This is kinda hard.

34
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:30,131
I don't want to just, you know, dump it.

35
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,093
But I want to be thoughtful about it.

36
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,554
[man 2] <i>From the moment she</i>
<i>set foot in our house,</i>

37
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,473
<i>she had this presence to her.</i>

38
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,767
She wants to see this place turned around.

39
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,895
Marie brought a whole bunch
of joy upon our home.

40
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,313
This is amazing.

41
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,440
[girl] You're so cute! I love you!

42
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,734
You're so cute.
I love you, too. [laughing]

43
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,028
These are, like, happy, happy tears.

44
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,197
Thank you for what you've brought
to our home, really.

45
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:06,668
[in Japanese] The tidying process
provides a unique opportunity

46
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,795
to understand what is
most important in one's life.

47
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:12,590
In this episode,
you will meet Aaron and Sehnita.

48
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:18,263
Join me as I help this family create
an ideal home for their desired future.

49
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,978
[birds chirping]

50
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,151
[boy] <i>Dada, could we go to Toys R Us?</i>

51
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,945
No, Ashton. We're getting rid of things
not going out and getting more.

52
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,364
[woman ] <i>And being happy with</i>
<i>how much we already have.</i>

53
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,158
-[Ashton] Okay.
-[doorbell chiming]

54
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,910
-[man] Hi.
-[Marie] Hi. Nice to meet you.

55
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,579
-I'm Marie.
-Nice to meet you.

56
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,080
Hi, very nice to meet you. Aaron.

57
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,249
I have to try. [speaking Japanese]

58
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,750
[Marie speaking Japanese]

59
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,336
Hi, I'm Iida, Miss Marie's interpreter.

60
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,797
Hi, Iida. Miss Marie's interpreter.
Nice to meet you.

61
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,133
And Natalia is two-and-a-half years old.

62
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,302
She's asleep.
She's taking a nap right now.

63
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,345
-[Iida translating]
-Oh, wow.

64
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,599
-My daughter is same, two years old.
-Oh, really?

65
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,725
And one years old.

66
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,727
-You have a two- and a one-year-old?
-Yes.

67
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,061
And you're organized?

68
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,646
[laughing]

69
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,148
We have no excuse. Alright.

70
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,900
We have no excuse.

71
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:15,987
I'm Sehnita.

72
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,071
I'm Aaron.

73
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,156
We're the Mattisons.

74
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,200
[Aaron] <i>We've been married 17 years.</i>

75
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,161
We met at the
University of Michigan junior year.

76
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,746
-I think we just--
-End of junior year,

77
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,705
start of senior year.

78
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,749
Started dating senior year,

79
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,210
we basically decided we want
a change of venue,

80
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,045
<i>the weather, time to get</i>
<i>some better weather.</i>

81
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,339
<i>We drove out to Los Angeles</i>
<i>and set up here.</i>

82
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,590
[Aaron] What's going on, guys?

83
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,217
-[Sehnita laughing]
-[Natalia squealing]

84
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,760
We live with our two children.

85
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,429
We have a
seven-and-a-half-year-old boy, Ashton

86
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,224
<i>and an almost three-year-old Natalia.</i>

87
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,268
We're here and we love it,

88
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,937
and we planning on being here
a long time.

89
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,064
[Aaron] <i>There's a thought, though,</i>
<i>as our lives,</i>

90
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,024
<i>we have so much love to give,</i>

91
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:56,444
<i>we live in a wonderful home, we're part</i>
<i>of a wonderful school district.</i>

92
00:03:56,527 --> 00:04:01,282
<i>We have a lot of opportunity to bring</i>
<i>another baby into this house,</i>

93
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,452
but the clutter, it just feels heavy.

94
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,704
It's just, you know, and overwhelming.

95
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,999
<i>We have a major amount of cleaning</i>
<i>that we need to undertake</i>

96
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,292
<i>before we move forward.</i>

97
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,504
[speaking Japanese]

98
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,005
[Aaron] This, yeah, this is the room
we use the most.

99
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,966
Like, the kitchen, the living room.

100
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,387
Definitely a lot of time spent watching TV
or, you know, playing.

101
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,097
[speaking Japanese]

102
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,266
Okay, so I see part of the problem.

103
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,394
Yeah, you're also seeing
part of the problem. [laughing]

104
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,814
[Sehnita] <i>You know, we've been</i>
<i>in our house for seven years.</i>

105
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,192
[Aaron] <i>But it's a never ending battle</i>
<i>to fight the clutter.</i>

106
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,735
<i>We have things,</i>

107
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,655
and those things end up taking
a space in our house and it's--

108
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,448
They get spread around,

109
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,368
<i>just multiplies, and pretty soon</i>
<i>our house is a chaotic mess.</i>

110
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,662
If we have a space that opens up,

111
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,372
pretty soon it'll get filled up.

112
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,207
[humming playfully]

113
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,793
-You fill up space, too.
-I do, I do.

114
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,086
It's gotta go somewhere.

115
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,255
And, look, there's an open spot!
How about there?

116
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,840
[laughing] Yes.

117
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,594
[Sehnita] <i>I feel like the clutter</i>
<i>is just-- it's like a big block now.</i>

118
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:07,765
<i>But added to it is</i>
<i>it's so stressful to clean the house.</i>

119
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,601
<i>It's hard to think about</i>
<i>doing anything else</i>

120
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,770
<i>'cause it always feels like,</i>
<i>"No, I gotta go clean."</i>

121
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,440
<i>So even when I'm relaxing,</i>
<i>I should be cleaning.</i>

122
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,067
-We have a fish on our table.
-We have a fish.

123
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,652
I don't why. But there it is.

124
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,903
[chuckling]

125
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,281
This is Natalia.

126
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,825
This is Miss Marie and Miss Iida.

127
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,493
-Can you say hi?
-[Marie] Hi.

128
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,704
Hello. [Marie laughing]

129
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,290
-No. She'll just sit here for a while.
-[Iida] Not yet, not yet.

130
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,250
Well, this is Ashton's room in here.

131
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,168
[Iida] Okay.

132
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,672
[Sehnita] This is his nice, big closet.

133
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:43,092
-So these are his--
-Clothes. Oh, pajamas?

134
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,137
His pajamas, his, uh, shirts.

135
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,432
Aaron wandered in here and realized that

136
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,435
I have taken over these three drawers.

137
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,103
They're awaiting your magic.

138
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,521
[Marie] What is that?

139
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,900
So, I was born in Pakistan.

140
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:03,529
So if we have Pakistani occasions,
I have my shawls to take.

141
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,073
When's the last time you wore them?

142
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,327
You know, I feel such a disconnect
to my culture to begin with.

143
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,872
<i>I don't have a big</i>
<i>Indian-Pakistani community</i>

144
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,124
<i>being here in Los Angeles.</i>

145
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,417
So...

146
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:22,256
you know, that's a little piece of
connection that I would like to hold onto.

147
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,758
[Aaron] This is our master.

148
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,885
We have lots of mess.

149
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,970
[Sehnita] This one is Aaron's closet.

150
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,306
Yeah, these are more like
my dress shirts, I go to work.

151
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,349
-Um...
-[Iida translates]

152
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,519
-[Aaron] Sehnita's clothes.
-[Marie] And some books?

153
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,854
[Sehnita] This might be my little problem.

154
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,065
I have a hard time
letting go of magazines.

155
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,901
This whole pile was in our bathroom.

156
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,445
I'd kind of hidden it from downstairs,

157
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,447
brought it upstairs, hidden it up there.

158
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,449
[speaking Japanese]

159
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,993
[Iida] Do you have any magazines
left in the bathroom right now?

160
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,955
Not in the bathroom.
I might have piles elsewhere.

161
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:58,459
I do think that Sehnita has a tendency
to hold onto more things.

162
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,379
[Aaron] <i>That's why working with Marie</i>
<i>would be very helpful.</i>

163
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,132
<i>I can't do it by myself.</i>
<i>I can't make her do it.</i>

164
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,967
-Those are mine. Close that door.
-Wait, okay.

165
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,885
-Let me go to--
-Go ahead and close that door.

166
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,762
No. Those aren't-- No.

167
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,763
You can close those.

168
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,974
-Let me try the next one.
-You can't throw those things.

169
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:16,602
I understand that I either hold onto
things or I'm sentimental about things.

170
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,355
<i>But we're not dying in here, like,</i>

171
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,860
they don't have to, like, airlift me out
of this house 'cause there's no path out.

172
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,279
I'm workable! [laughing]

173
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,572
[Marie speaking Japanese]

174
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,907
[Iida] Oh, my goodness.
Look at this closet. It's huge!

175
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,243
[speaking Japanese]

176
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,705
Okay, so all of your dresses here. I see.

177
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,875
So, half of these dresses
I can't wear right now, but...

178
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,086
I don't want to give up
on getting to my goal weight,

179
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,672
so I don't want to let go of these yet.

180
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:48,301
These shorts don't fit me,
but I can't get rid of them.

181
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,343
Look at these shoes.

182
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,221
These are another one of those pairs
that I can't get rid of.

183
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,973
I don't think I've ever
seen her wear them.

184
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,435
[laughing] These are maternity clothes.

185
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:02,023
We were-- part of our goal
of wanting to clear our house is

186
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,275
we would like to add a third baby.

187
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:07,028
And it feels like
if we can't get our house clean,

188
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,655
you know, maybe we shouldn't
go down that path.

189
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,659
I just know that if we have
this much junk right now,

190
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,079
like, if we were to have a third,
it would only get worse from here.

191
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,458
[upbeat music playing]

192
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,086
-Welcome.
-Here it is.

193
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,590
I think some of the things
that we need a little help with

194
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,218
-in the garage are clothes.
-[Marie speaking Japanese]

195
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,136
[Iida] All these clothes you've kept,
you never let any of them go?

196
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,972
Not any of Ashton's clothes,

197
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,265
not any of Natalia's clothes.

198
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,433
[Aaron] These are just suitcases.

199
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,020
And these suitcases
have suitcases in them.

200
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,690
So I think we need help
minimizing a little.

201
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:48,236
I feel like-- You know, he's saying
we should get rid of them,

202
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,071
I think we need to take more family trips.

203
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,656
-[Aaron] Not all.
-To make use of them.

204
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,741
Trivial Pursuit.

205
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,076
-Two of two.
-We need them both.

206
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,036
Whole different experience.

207
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,163
We actually have three. One's inside.

208
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:03,125
And we also have kids toys over there.

209
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,835
[speaking Japanese]

210
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,713
So your kids,
they don't play with those toys?

211
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,298
-[Aaron] No.
-[Sehnita] Not right now.

212
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,177
If we can get
this whole garage organized more,

213
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,472
then they'll be in a place
where they can access them easier.

214
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,891
Once you do your magic. [chuckling]

215
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:24,313
I want to clean up my stuff,
but I feel like I'm not getting there.

216
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,232
So, for me...

217
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,278
what I've really wrapped
my head around in my life is

218
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,363
<i>if I'm not doing the things</i>
<i>that I need to do,</i>

219
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,699
<i>then, you know, go seek out experts</i>

220
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,326
that can help you make
the change that you need.

221
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,954
[speaking Japanese]

222
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:43,791
[Iida] This KonMari Method is not
a simple method to clean your house.

223
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:44,959
Mm-hmm.

224
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,752
[speaking Japanese]

225
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,588
[Iida] You mentioned my magic.

226
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,507
I'm sorry to say that
I don't use any magic.

227
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,175
Only you can do that.

228
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,469
[speaking Japanese]

229
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:59,432
[Iida] But at the same time, I have seen
many of my clients transform their lives

230
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,017
because in their heart of hearts,

231
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,102
they were ready to prepare
to change their life.

232
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:06,230
I want to, she wants to,
we want to put in the hard work.

233
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,691
And that's where I think
we're just looking for the guidance.

234
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,234
[in Japanese] Thank you so much.

235
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,820
I'm so honored and thankful
to hear you say that.

236
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,281
<i>We're ready to declutter the home because</i>

237
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:19,619
we foresee staying here for, you know,
the next 20 years maybe.

238
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:24,165
So, there's nothing that is going to
force us to go through our stuff,

239
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,125
except for something like this.

240
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,086
[Sehnita] <i>I'm so excited. </i>[laughing]

241
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:35,885
[doorbell chiming]

242
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,972
-Good morning!
-[Marie] Hi! Good morning!

243
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,849
Good to see you. Good morning.

244
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,060
-Hi. Good morning.
-Hi, good morning.

245
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,897
-[Sehnita] There's Natalia to greet you.
-[speaking Japanese, laughing]

246
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,108
[Sehnita] She had a slight run-in
with the dog this morning

247
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,902
so she's recovering.

248
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,321
-Do you want to go to the other room?
-Yes.

249
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,114
[Marie speaking Japanese]

250
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,492
[Iida] So today, we'll tackle clothes.

251
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,501
[Sehnita] Oh, my gosh.
This mountain of things.

252
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,716
[Iida] So from here, you're gonna be
going through every single piece,

253
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,967
piece by piece.

254
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,763
[Sehnita chuckling]
I feel very overwhelmed.

255
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,390
It does feel overwhelming.

256
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,517
-[speaking Japanese]
-Let's breathe.

257
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,185
Let's take a deep breath of air.

258
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,853
[deep exhale]

259
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,481
-[speaking Japanese]
-Stretch.

260
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,657
[in Japanese]
When you feel stuck while tidying,

261
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,200
try and change the air.

262
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:45,454
Simply opening the windows
will be effective,

263
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,331
but there are other ways as well.

264
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,834
[high-pitched tone sounding]

265
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:54,046
<i>Create a sound that has a great vibration.</i>

266
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,590
Light a candle.

267
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,469
<i>Spray an aromatic room spray.</i>

268
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,847
[inhaling]

269
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,557
<i>Lighting some incense...</i>

270
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,767
<i>is also an option.</i>

271
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,105
<i>By creating smoke, it'll purify the room.</i>

272
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:17,862
Of course, you can do these every day
and not just when tidying.

273
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:24,201
I use these methods
to purify my home every day.

274
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,078
[speaking Japanese]

275
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,415
So my advice is go with something that's
very easy for you to make a decision on,

276
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,167
something that you'd know right away.

277
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,921
You know, it's like...

278
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,383
it's hard to understand
my feelings because,

279
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:43,679
you know, there's some things where I'm
like, "No, this doesn't spark joy in me."

280
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,807
It fits me and that's--
and so it's practical,

281
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,601
so I'm glad it fits me.

282
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,812
But, no I'm not happy I have to wear you.
[chuckling]

283
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,815
[Marie speaking Japanese]

284
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,485
[Iida] But I do understand
because of my height.

285
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,320
You have no idea what a nightmare it is

286
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:02,948
for me to find clothes that fit me
because I'm so short, in that sense.

287
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,366
And small.

288
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,286
But, in a sense, I will just recommend

289
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,498
picking out clothes that fit you right now
that you're comfortable with

290
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,999
and decide from there.

291
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,044
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-This I wear.

292
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,462
[Iida translating]

293
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,799
This I wear.

294
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,343
-[speaking Japanese]
-And it sparks joy for you?

295
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,597
-Yeah.
-Okay.

296
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,432
-[laughing]
-[speaking Japanese]

297
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,268
Instead of just basing it on
whether you wear it or not,

298
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,145
think about,
"Do I really need this piece?"

299
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,563
"Is it necessary for my life?"

300
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:39,401
[Sehnita] <i>My problem with clothing</i>
<i>and feeling the joy,</i>

301
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:44,281
<i>it's hard because it's that idea that you</i>
<i>don't let go of things if it's functional.</i>

302
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,535
Like, you don't wear
cocktail dresses all the time,

303
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,161
but if you have a cocktail party,

304
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,372
you don't want to buy
a new one each time either.

305
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,041
[Marie speaking Japanese]

306
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,711
-Yes, Aaron, you're doing very well.
-You're doing great.

307
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,713
-[Iida] Very calm.
-Aren't you the best?

308
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,840
[laughing]

309
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,134
-Don't the teachers like you?
-Don't get angry. [laughing]

310
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,136
[Sehnita] <i>Aaron and I are different.</i>

311
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,888
I'm funny, she's not.

312
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,558
-My friends think I'm funny.
-Your friends think you're funny.

313
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,770
<i>Um, yes, maybe Aaron's, like, quick</i>
<i>to want to</i>

314
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,897
you know, be like,
"Okay, I gotta clear my space,"

315
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,024
and maybe I slow him down to be like,

316
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,068
"Wait a minute,
I want you to really think, like,

317
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:24,905
are you getting rid of anything
that might be important to you?"

318
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,825
And for me, he's going to help me be like,

319
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,327
"Alright, come on, you don't
need to hold onto those things.

320
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,454
That's just more things
we have to clean up."

321
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,456
-Thank you, bye bye.
-Thank you so much.

322
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,041
-Bye.
-Bye!

323
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,502
A lot to do. The homework is now

324
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,671
go through our clothes,
sort through the things we--

325
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,214
that don't spark joy,
move them out.

326
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:48,137
[Aaron] This is what happens when you
first start going through the process.

327
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,182
[Sehnita] <i>I do still feel stuck in the...</i>

328
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,476
Like having...

329
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,814
Being in the limbo of having clothes
that I need to hold onto.

330
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,026
But when you say, "Have to hold onto,"
what do you mean have to hold?

331
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,611
Why do you have to hold onto 'em?

332
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,738
Like, you can just easily say,

333
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,407
"This sparks joy, this doesn't spark joy."

334
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,577
There's a certain amount of things that
I, yeah, honestly when I take a step back

335
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,287
and I look at some of the stuff I have--

336
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,081
Like, okay, do I want
to hold onto this because--

337
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,875
[Sehnita] You can't let go of that!

338
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,543
See, this is why I can't show you things.

339
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,087
<i>With Sehnita and I, I would love</i>
<i>better communication</i>

340
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,298
<i>dealing with items in our house</i>

341
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,926
because sometimes it feels like
she automatically goes and says,

342
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,469
"No, we should keep it."

343
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,262
[Aaron sighing] That's a lot of stuff.

344
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,056
[Sehnita] We're gonna be here
'til midnight.

345
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,767
-Not me. Nope.
<i>-We</i> are going to be here till midnight.

346
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,353
I was gonna go downstairs
and play video games with Ashton.

347
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,355
[Aaron] Goodbye.

348
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,614
[in Japanese]
Folding clothes is so much fun!

349
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,908
About folding baby clothes,

350
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,285
here's how to fold baby onesies.

351
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,788
First, fold in half vertically,

352
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,500
tuck in the sleeves,

353
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,713
fold it in half,

354
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,425
and then fold into thirds.

355
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,388
Like this, when it is folded
into a square, you are finished.

356
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,807
Next, how to fold socks.

357
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,768
Place one on top of the other

358
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,895
and just fold them in half,

359
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,314
making them very compact.

360
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,775
How to fold underwear.

361
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,988
Fold the bottom up.

362
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,616
Next fold it in half,

363
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,327
and then in half again.

364
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,750
[Aaron] That's my blue jeans here.
This is gonna be my sweaters here.

365
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:46,088
I think I'm getting close to
getting my stuff gone through.

366
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,881
I feel good, um...

367
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,425
[laughing]

368
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,219
Isn't that great? He feels good.

369
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:55,889
I am finding it really challenging
to go through my clothes

370
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,392
because even things I like don't fit well,

371
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,812
so I'm not willing to let go
of all those things.

372
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,440
I just realized I'm on camera
and I didn't put on makeup.

373
00:17:04,522 --> 00:17:07,108
Hmm. Alright, so I'm gonna end this video.

374
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,162
[doorbell chiming]

375
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,498
-[Aaron] Hey, Sehnita.
-Yeah?

376
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,958
-[Aaron] Marie's here.
-Oh, okay.

377
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,627
-Hi, good morning.
-Good morning.

378
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,255
-Good to see you again.
-Good to see you.

379
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:31,216
-Morning, good to see you.
-Sehnita's just upstairs doing some work.

380
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,886
[Aaron] These are all the clothes
we'll be getting rid of.

381
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,971
So this is a mixture
of Sehnita's and mine.

382
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,681
[Marie speaking Japanese]

383
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,349
-[Iida] That's wonderful.
-[Aaron] Yes.

384
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,977
And she's in Ashton's room.

385
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,562
Ooh.

386
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,815
-Good morning, hi!
-Hi, Marie. How are you?

387
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,609
Good to see you.

388
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,319
-Good morning.
-Good morning, how are you?

389
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,822
I'm feverishly trying to
go through these, uh, scarves

390
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,908
and you're here at a perfect time
'cause I was like

391
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,285
I don't know if I know how to fold them.

392
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,370
[speaking Japanese]

393
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,915
[Iida] Oh, but you did it just right.

394
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,000
-Nearly there.
-Okay.

395
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,877
[Iida] Okay, so first...

396
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,670
[speaking Japanese]

397
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,675
I would make sure that
the fringe is rolled inside.

398
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,718
Okay.

399
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,805
[speaking Japanese]

400
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:23,435
[Iida] This way you'll protect the fringes
and you'll avoid any unwanted wrinkles.

401
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,730
And then if they're different sizes,
like, I was trying to do this one

402
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:31,026
and it was a little bit bigger,
so do I try to get it this size?

403
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,861
[Marie speaking Japanese]

404
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,281
So you can just categorize by size
if that's the case.

405
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:41,495
I'm sure you have other bigger scarves
as well, so just keep those together.

406
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:45,082
Well I'm-- I like this method
because honestly, um,

407
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:49,461
it was so hard when I was stacking them
to know what color was in there,

408
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:53,090
which one to get,
so I probably didn't use them

409
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,551
as much as I wanted to
because I couldn't see them.

410
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,760
[Marie speaking Japanese]

411
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,470
[Iida] This applies to every
storage space,

412
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,390
but when you open the drawer and
you can immediately see what's inside,

413
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,307
it's really useful.

414
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,435
[Sehnita]
It is so useful. It was a lot of work.

415
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,313
It was a lot of work to go through
all of our clothes,

416
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,233
um, but we're ready
for the next challenge.

417
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,990
[Aaron] <i>We have ten boxes of books,</i>

418
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,867
<i>four or five boxes of magazines.</i>

419
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,328
[Marie  speaking Japanese]

420
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,498
Something that I do
is to wake them up first.

421
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,835
Books that have been stored in boxes
for a long time are sleeping.

422
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,420
They would like some waking up.

423
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,713
-Yes
-[laughing]

424
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,007
They're all sleepy. [chuckling]

425
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,383
[Marie speaking Japanese]

426
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,386
[Iida] And once we've woken them up
take each book, one by one,

427
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,556
and ask yourself, "Is this something
that I would like to bring with me

428
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,807
into the future?"

429
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,101
[Sehnita] <i>Books are a part of my identity.</i>

430
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:50,397
I mean, I do really value them
and I value them being in our house.

431
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,150
<i>It will be very hard for me</i>
<i>to get rid of them.</i>

432
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,569
-[Marie] Bye!
-[Iida] Thank you so much.

433
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,655
It just feels like
those are people's works.

434
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:02,201
Just to, like, kinda just
dump them in a trash heap--

435
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,244
it doesn't feel good to me.

436
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,622
Think you're gonna use this
or you have the internet?

437
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,540
You got the internet.

438
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,711
-Don't you think?
-Can it be in a maybe pile?

439
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,713
Where's your maybe pile?

440
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,841
Here. [laughing]

441
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,720
[Aaron] <i>I definitely understand Sehnita</i>
<i>seeing certain items</i>

442
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,223
<i>and struggling with it as far as looking</i>
<i>and saying, you know,</i>

443
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,434
<i>"Does it bring me joy or does it</i>
<i>bring me guilt for getting rid of it?"</i>

444
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,896
<i>Because even if she said</i>
<i>it's okay to let it go,</i>

445
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,189
she'll have second thoughts.

446
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,024
-Let's get rid of 'em.
-No, I'm going--

447
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,860
[whispering] No, I'm not gonna get rid--
We can't get rid of them.

448
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,946
We're going to give them
for the other baby.

449
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,322
Why are you whispering to me?

450
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,574
[whispering]
Because I'm trying not to yell.

451
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:50,540
[Sehnita] Because we're definitely
on, uh, different pages about

452
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,043
saving books for a potential third.

453
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:58,298
I don't want to, at this point,
get rid of everything just...

454
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,051
<i>to have to go buy them again next year.</i>

455
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,887
<i>That doesn't make sense to me.</i>
<i>That doesn't make fiscal sense to me.</i>

456
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,140
Like, with her I'd have to make
her feel okay

457
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,893
that I'm not just going to get rid of
things that she wants

458
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,312
<i>because I know there is</i>
<i>still this fear in her mind that</i>

459
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,941
<i>every stage she's concerned</i>
<i>that I'm going to move things out</i>

460
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,193
that she's going to regret losing.

461
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,153
[Aaron]
Final check for the books, I guess.

462
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,865
Sehnita's just doing a one last review
of the books in here.

463
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,575
Um, I thought they were all boxed.

464
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,703
I said, "Hey I'm gonna
take these to the garage."

465
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,997
She was like, "I want one more look."

466
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,002
So, so close.
I guess this is the final stage.

467
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,046
Uh-oh, she's got a pile
of books she's holding onto.

468
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,468
[Aaron] Oh, Sehni.

469
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,138
Marie's here with boxes.

470
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,224
-[Aaron] Hello.
-Hello!

471
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,684
Can I help?

472
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,686
-[Marie] it's fine.
-[Aaron] You're fine?

473
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:53,895
Hi, good to see you again.

474
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,647
Hello, how are you?

475
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:56,940
So good to see you.

476
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,650
[Sehnita] <i>The deeper we get into this,</i>

477
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,611
it's really difficult to do.

478
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,990
But I will say, little by little,

479
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,452
walking into open spaces

480
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,786
has been...

481
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,705
Like, you feel it.

482
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,416
You feel so much better.
And you know who's loving it the most?

483
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,709
<i>Mazzie the cat.</i>

484
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,919
She is loving the open spaces.

485
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,504
She's pouncing here and there

486
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,632
and I want to feel the joy
that cat is feeling.

487
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,177
[speaking Japanese]

488
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,805
-So, books, pretty much done, I see?
-[Sehnita] Yes.

489
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,475
We finished up the books.
It was tough, but like magazines,

490
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,894
she actually got rid of
a lot of magazines.

491
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:37,564
You might have thought that was a simple
task for me to get my magazines out,

492
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,775
but they were there for... [laughing]

493
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,360
...a few days, weeks.

494
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,028
[Marie speaking Japanese]

495
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,154
[Iida] Well done.

496
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,614
[speaking Japanese]

497
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:49,326
[Iida] Our focus going forward
is all the miscellaneous items.

498
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,329
The garage and also the children's toys.

499
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,585
[Marie speaking Japanese]

500
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,296
So for toys, gather them
all together at once.

501
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,550
You will be going through them as parents
and deciding how often do they get used,

502
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:09,179
but I'm sure your kids have a particular
attachment to certain toys,

503
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:11,139
so this is where you want
to engage the kids

504
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,016
and work together with them as well.

505
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,728
Really encourage them to thank
each item that they're letting go.

506
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,610
[in Japanese] When tidying kids' toys,

507
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:27,823
take out all the toys first.

508
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:33,161
If you have more than one child,
create a separate pile for each.

509
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,080
For example, these are brother's,

510
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:39,084
these are sister's,
and here are shared toys.

511
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:43,380
Have your children choose
the toys that spark joy.

512
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:49,344
However, all toys may spark joy for them.

513
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:53,223
So ask them to rank the toys.

514
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,392
When it comes to storing toys,

515
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,853
it is important to divide
the space clearly.

516
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,480
For example, this box is for him,

517
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:05,318
these boxes are for both,
and one box is for her.

518
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,404
When you store shared items,

519
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,990
you can keep them according to category.

520
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:13,410
Here are the toys for physical play.

521
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,912
And here are stuffed animals.

522
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,915
These can be stored like this.

523
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,044
[Aaron] Thank you. Bye.

524
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,629
-Bye!
-Bye, see you later.

525
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,922
See you later!

526
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,716
[Aaron] Okay, let's work.

527
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,219
Toys.

528
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,435
[sighing]

529
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:41,396
Toys are everywhere.
The toys, we have so many toys.

530
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,191
[Sehnita] Do you like your toys
all piled up, Natalia?

531
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,026
-[Natalia] Yep.
-[Aaron] Happy birthday!

532
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,944
-We got this for you.
-[Sehnita laughing]

533
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,696
[Aaron] <i>I'm ready to get rid</i>
<i>of a lot of it.</i>

534
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:53,283
<i>For Sehnita, the toys are tied</i>
<i>to emotional sentiment</i>

535
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,577
with people who gave us particular toys,

536
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,662
<i>the toys being attached to memories</i>

537
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,831
<i>from when Ashton and Natalia</i>
<i>played with them.</i>

538
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,333
[Sehnita] Ashton wanted this case.

539
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,210
Like, wanted when he was,
like, four years old?

540
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:06,213
-[Sehnita] Natalia probably wants it.
-[Aaron] You're killing me.

541
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,424
I would like to keep
the Transformer types.

542
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,884
I think they're kinda neat.

543
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,053
-Um...
-But they don't really play with them.

544
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,555
Yeah, but I do. [laughing]

545
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,350
[Aaron] Hey, Natalia, why's there
a mess on the floor?

546
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:22,187
I-- 'Cause I wanted to give it away!

547
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,231
-[Aaron] You want to give all that away?
-Yeah.

548
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,732
So you were going through your toys

549
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,734
and making a pile
of things you don't want?

550
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,903
Uh, no, I want it.

551
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,781
[Aaron] Can you pick out one toy
that you don't really play with anymore?

552
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,199
[Natalia] Hmm, ah!

553
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,992
[Aaron] Alright, and that's how you start.

554
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:43,083
[Aaron] And everyone else is setting up
for a nice, somewhat lazy Sunday,

555
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,293
but Mom and Dad are gonna
get off the couch

556
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,087
and get up to work again.

557
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,380
Not right now!

558
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,257
[Aaron] But, dear!

559
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,427
[Aaron] <i>The garage is a mini version</i>
<i>of our house.</i>

560
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,930
<i>It has anything and everything in it.</i>

561
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,932
What about all these, like, pots?

562
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,767
Some of those pots are gonna go,

563
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,271
some are going to have
our succulents put into it.

564
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,605
Are we doing this right now?

565
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,107
I'm just looking at this beauty.

566
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,650
It is pretty, isn't it?

567
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,236
I was being facetious. Sorry.

568
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:14,489
I walk into it and I'm like,
"I don't know where to start."

569
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:18,827
Bikes. We can't really get rid of any
of them because if we do have the third,

570
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,328
they're going to want it.

571
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,330
These two boxes are from the move,

572
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,583
so we've been in this house
for seven years,

573
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,418
we haven't unpacked those.

574
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,212
[Sehnita] But if we have the space for it
why can't we just keep it?

575
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,173
Oh, Natalia's going to be
mad at you about this.

576
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,009
I don't want to get to the point of

577
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,720
throwing my hands up and saying,
"We're just gonna live in a pigsty."

578
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:40,390
[Aaron] <i>But Sehnita's having a hard time</i>
<i>letting go of a lot of things.</i>

579
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,933
<i>She needs to commit.</i>

580
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,144
From zero to five years old,

581
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,730
it's hard to give... give that up.

582
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,982
What he says is, "We don't need this."

583
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:54,029
And then I stop, "Well, no, I do,"
or, "I do want it."

584
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,488
This is our garage

585
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,617
and the only thing of tools
is one little shelf.

586
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,660
-There's no garage stuff in here.
-Wait, honestly--

587
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,537
-It's like toys and clothes and--
-Yes, so?

588
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,830
Put it into perspective.

589
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,000
One thing for tools,
the rest is everything else.

590
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,711
You're making me the bad guy
for I don't know what.

591
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,173
I definitely feel like
I'm being guilted into

592
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,507
getting rid of things.

593
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,052
I don't think that's what it's about.

594
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,013
So if I go back to,
"Oh, no, I wanna keep that thing,"

595
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,890
why isn't it a very clear,
like, "Okay, sure."

596
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,601
I'm not gonna feel bad about that.
I'm sorry.

597
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:27,812
[Sehnita] So when you try to tell me
I don't let go of things,

598
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:28,730
I don't like that.

599
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,357
[Aaron] You have got to stop,

600
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,150
otherwise we're never gonna
get through this.

601
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,485
I'm at a loss.

602
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,119
The more I think about it, the more...

603
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,954
I just get upset.

604
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,458
I get that I have a strong personality.

605
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,170
I thought the whole process is,

606
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:56,841
hey, you talk, you share, you share
your thoughts, your feelings...

607
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:01,262
You-- You lay it all out there.
Well, I feel like...

608
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,685
laying it all out there
only makes it worse.

609
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:09,354
Maybe it's just a cultural difference.

610
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:13,274
Maybe it's just different
styles and methods.

611
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,528
And if that's the case,
I can't change someone else either.

612
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,279
I'm looking to change.

613
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,448
I'm open to change.

614
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,868
I wanted to go through this process.

615
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,578
And...

616
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,500
This was my step forward,

617
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,003
and I'm not looking to go backwards.

618
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,046
So...

619
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,383
this place is gonna get into shape...

620
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:40,844
no matter what.

621
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,512
And that's just how it is.

622
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,641
[gentle guitar music playing]

623
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,272
What's a matter?

624
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:53,898
Huh?

625
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,069
[Sehnita] <i>This has been a pretty</i>
<i>challenging and nerve-racking process</i>

626
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,654
<i>for us to go through together.</i>

627
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,323
[Natalia whimpering]

628
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,909
<i>But now I realize</i>

629
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,871
Aaron and I do not need
a lot of things to be happy,

630
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:12,250
<i>and I think that's part of what</i>
<i>has drawn us to each other.</i>

631
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,878
And to be able to come together

632
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,715
<i>in this process</i>
<i>and re-establish that idea,</i>

633
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:23,094
<i>you know, us in our family, like,</i>
<i>we don't need a lot of things, and...</i>

634
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:28,683
that's been interesting because of all
of the things that we were surrounded by.

635
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,769
I think we were forgetting that.

636
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:33,897
[Aaron] <i>You want tea?</i>

637
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:35,774
[Sehnita] <i>Yes.</i>

638
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,027
[Aaron] What time d'you
go to bed last night?

639
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,361
Four, four-thirty.

640
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,613
So what were you doing?

641
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:46,534
Like, why am I holding onto
a seven-dollar shirt I got really cheap

642
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,994
that doesn't really fit?

643
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:50,997
It's kind of putting it in perspective.
I don't need to hold onto this.

644
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,375
Every single one of us should be
examining the things we have and...

645
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,669
deciding if we need it or not.

646
00:29:56,753 --> 00:30:01,090
I really just had this feeling
like I'm ready to let go,

647
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:05,303
and to take control of the things
that are in my house.

648
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,721
Are these garbage?

649
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,223
Those shoes? Yes.

650
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,267
I guess I'll just get rid of 'em.
You served me well, shoes.

651
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:15,605
These things that are just
taking up space in your own house,

652
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:17,065
you gotta give it up.

653
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,608
Does it bring you joy?

654
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,902
-Now, if it's nostalgia, the story--
-Not really.

655
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,238
-Okay, well then--
-[laughing]

656
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,448
I mean, thank you!

657
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,075
[laughing]

658
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,704
[Aaron] It feels good to sort of
move this out of the--

659
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,499
yeah, out of the garage,
sort of move it out of our house

660
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,292
and then to a better home.

661
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,593
It is exhausting.

662
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,805
I really do feel extremely exhausted

663
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,766
and we're not even
at a halfway point yet.

664
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,476
[Sehnita] <i>Very overwhelmed.</i>

665
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,022
So it's Friday.

666
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,733
A couple days since we had
the mass chaos

667
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,402
of dumping out a lot of things.

668
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,237
[Aaron] Yeah!

669
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,614
[Aaron] This, I think we need to get
a vase from outside.

670
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,950
-[Sehnita] I don't-- That can, those--
-[Aaron] It can go?

671
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,327
Then I'll throw this stuff out. Great.
I'll be back.

672
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,621
You got a little excited about that!

673
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,331
She's doing a lot,
she's giving away a lot.

674
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,876
I'm very proud of her, so I just
wanted to give her those kudos.

675
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,168
Good job.

676
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:20,712
Still cuckoo.

677
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,548
-I mean, kudos. Lots of kudos.
-[laughing]

678
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,800
Now I feel we're on the same level.

679
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,635
Same place.

680
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,971
You'll never be at my level.

681
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,519
-Hi! How are you?
-[laughing]

682
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,605
How are you? It's good to see you.

683
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,981
Good to see you again.

684
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,190
-Hi.
-Hi.

685
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,151
[speaking Japanese]

686
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,819
[Iida] What's the occasion? So beautiful!

687
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,447
Our last visit. I had to dress up.
[laughing]

688
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,115
[Aaron] We can show you
the guest bedroom.

689
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,533
[Iida] Yes, definitely.

690
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:55,038
[Aaron] <i>Beforehand I had to put</i>
<i>blinders on to the clutter.</i>

691
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,291
<i>So now, it's just-- it's night and day.</i>

692
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,752
-[speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] Oh, my gosh!

693
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,837
-[Sehnita] It's all clear.
-[Iida] Look at this room.

694
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,130
[Marie speaking Japanese]

695
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,090
[Iida] <i>All those cardboard boxes</i>
<i>are gone?</i>

696
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,344
-[Aaron] <i>Gone.</i>
-[Sehnita] <i>Yes, a lot of moving around.</i>

697
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:13,264
I love this house. I love being here.
I love spending time here.

698
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,476
[Aaron] <i>This process of looking</i>
<i>at what's in our life</i>

699
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,979
<i>makes it so that we're not gonna</i>
<i>take the items we have for granted,</i>

700
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,857
<i>that we're not going to just bring</i>
<i>more things into the household.</i>

701
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,192
[Marie speaking Japanese]

702
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,319
[Iida] I love this dining room table.
It's beautiful.

703
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,237
-You can see it now!
-[Iida] Yes.

704
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:31,491
There's some mental space that has
been cleared up through this process

705
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:34,535
<i>and it was something</i>
<i>that I've needed for a very long time,</i>

706
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,912
<i>so it feels very good.</i>

707
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,747
You go right ahead.

708
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,332
Wow.

709
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,251
[Aaron] <i>The way we approach our house</i>
<i>feels vastly different</i>

710
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,505
<i>and sort of the way we're trying</i>
<i>to live our lives feels vastly different.</i>

711
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,048
-[Marie] <i>Wow!</i>
-[Iida] <i>Amazing.</i>

712
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,760
[Aaron] <i>It's actually a very deep</i>
<i>and meaningful change</i>

713
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,845
<i>that we can carry with us going forward.</i>

714
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,641
[Sehnita] <i>And it felt good to feel like</i>
<i>if it's not bringing joy,</i>

715
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,978
<i>I can just go ahead and let it go,</i>
<i>I don't have to keep putting it back.</i>

716
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,980
<i>Let go. It's easy.</i>

717
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,108
If we have a third, we can do this now,

718
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,901
<i>because before it just felt like,</i>

719
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,363
<i>"I'm gonna put the bassinet on a pile</i>
<i>of, like, junk and papers,</i>

720
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:16,077
<i>but now I feel very good that</i>
<i>they would be well taken care of.</i>

721
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,412
Like the other two.

722
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,917
You can actually see from one end
to the next. [laughing]

723
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,215
[Marie speaking Japanese]

724
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:32,176
[Iida] <i>Look at this place!</i>
<i>How everything that was in here!</i>

725
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,220
<i>-Oh, my goodness!</i>
-[Aaron] <i>We can park a car now.</i>

726
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,016
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] <i>I am speechless.</i>

727
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,517
[Sehnita] Aww!

728
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,728
[speaking Japanese]

729
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,813
[Iida] My method of tidying
really helps you

730
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,065
not just clean the surface of your home,

731
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,151
but to really consider
how you want to live

732
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,028
and what kind of relationship
you want have

733
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:53,865
with your family, with your friends,
and all the things that surround you.

734
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:58,077
So I'm really happy and honored
that you really absorbed that.

735
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,622
[Aaron] <i>This process, some ways,</i>
<i>has highlighted our opposite natures.</i>

736
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,626
<i>At the same time, it did sort of help us</i>
<i>better understand each other,</i>

737
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,670
<i>but also to work together</i>
<i>in a meaningful way.</i>

738
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:13,217
It was kinda nice because this is a great
foundation to launch into the next stage.

739
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:16,262
-Thank you for bringing your magic to us.
-Thank you!

740
00:34:16,344 --> 00:34:18,514
Thank you so much. Thank you.

741
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,766
-Bye, thank you very much.
-Bye!

742
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,476
-[Aaron] Can you say bye again?
-Goodbye!

743
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,771
Bye!

744
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,981
-[Aaron] Bye.
-[Marie] So cute!

745
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,068
-Say bye.
-Bye, Marie! Bye, Miss Marie Kondo!

746
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,027
[Natalia] Bye, Miss Marie Kondo!

747
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,112
-[Aaron] Yeah, bye-bye.

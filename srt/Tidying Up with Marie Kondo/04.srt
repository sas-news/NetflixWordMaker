00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,924
-Ah!
-[woman] She looks excited!

2
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:11,052
I'm so excited because I love mess.

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:14,347
[man] It's a never ending battle
to fight the clutter.

4
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,349
-[knocking]
-Oh!

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,019
I want things to be more simple.
I don't know how to fix it.

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,438
With the baby coming,
it's gonna be more chaos.

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,314
[gasping, squealing]

8
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,567
[man] Oh, my God! We have too much stuff!

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,028
Hello, I'm Marie Kondo.

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,279
[in Japanese] My mission

11
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,741
is to spark joy in the world
through cleaning.

12
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:33,950
Ching!

13
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,995
[narrator] <i>Best-selling author</i>
<i>and world-renowned tidying expert</i>

14
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:41,583
<i>Marie Kondo is dedicated to inspiring</i>
<i>the world to choose joy</i>

15
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,334
<i>with the KonMari Method.</i>

16
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,253
[in Japanese]
A feature of the KonMari Method

17
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:48,214
<i>is that you clean by item</i>
<i>and not by location.</i>

18
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,718
And we will always clean using
the same categories.

19
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,386
[in English] First, is clothing.

20
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,096
-[Marie grunting]
-[laughter]

21
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,264
I can't reach.

22
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,849
Next, is books.

23
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,852
[Iida] Giving them a little shake
and wake them up.

24
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,479
Then, paper.

25
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,438
[man sighs] I can't do the papers.

26
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,690
[deep groan]

27
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,027
The largest category is <i>komono.</i>

28
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,614
<i>Komono </i>is kitchen, bathroom,

29
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,740
and garage.

30
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,868
Everything miscellaneous.

31
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,163
Finally, sentimental items.

32
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,999
It's kinda hard to let it go,
'cause I really like this one.

33
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,212
[sniffling] This is kinda hard.

34
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:30,131
I don't want to just, you know, dump it.

35
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,093
But I want to be thoughtful about it.

36
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,554
[man 2] <i>From the moment she</i>
<i>set foot in our house,</i>

37
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,473
<i>she had this presence to her.</i>

38
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,767
She wants to see this place turned around.

39
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,895
Marie brought a whole bunch
of joy upon our home.

40
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,313
This is amazing.

41
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,440
[girl] You're so cute! I love you!

42
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,734
You're so cute.
 I love you, too. [laughing]

43
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,028
These are, like, happy, happy tears.

44
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,197
Thank you for what you've brought
to our home, really.

45
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,450
[gentle guitar music playing]

46
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,994
[crunching]

47
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,462
I am Margie Hodges,

48
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,673
Margaret when my mom is mad at me.
[chuckles]

49
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,800
I live in Culver City, California.

50
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,345
My home has a lot of personal effects,

51
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,724
it has a lot of memories,
it has a lot of photographs, um,

52
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,601
mementos from traveling,

53
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,811
you know, I just like a place that just

54
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,855
anybody can come in,
and feel like they're at home.

55
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:12,400
I had two little toddlers when we moved
into this particular house,

56
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,444
and then had another child afterwards,

57
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,572
so, yeah, almost 30 years in,
in this house.

58
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,248
[Margie] So, my salt and pepper's here,
cumin,

59
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,083
-put a little coriander, whatever.
-[sizzling]

60
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,376
[woman] Onions are, like...

61
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,380
[Margie] Lu, a little, a little cilantro.

62
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,299
[Lucy] I thought you didn't
even like cilantro.

63
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,884
-[Margie] It's okay.
-It'll shrink down.

64
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,052
-[Margie] Okay.
-[man] Hello.

65
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:42,222
-[Margie] Hey, Jake man, how was school?
-Good. What's up?

66
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,057
-[Margie sighs] Hi.
-Hi.

67
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,267
-We're gonna make you a healthy dinner.
-[laughing]

68
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,020
-You're not used that that, huh?
-Do you wanna put some of this in?

69
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,647
[Margie] Yeah, that's-- Leave that.

70
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,107
-That one's open, I think it's fine.
-The secret ingredient.

71
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,236
Just shake it up so it's...
I do have a lot of stuff, guys.

72
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,280
You never know what kid's gonna come over
to borrow something.

73
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,281
[laughing]

74
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,658
[Margie] Already.

75
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,868
Oh, I found some stuff.

76
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:04,869
Let me show you.

77
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,497
I wanted to show you
some pictures I found.

78
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,085
I'm proud of my home.

79
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,170
You know,
it saw us through some good times

80
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,839
and then it saw us through
some really dark times towards the end,

81
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,257
when my husband got sick.

82
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,885
It changed... just everything.

83
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,263
I wish you guys could meet my husband.
He's...

84
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,599
<i>Life of the party, larger than life,</i>

85
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,560
<i>physically, and just his personality.</i>

86
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,939
<i>He just was the guy everybody flocked to.</i>

87
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,650
<i>And he took good care of me</i>

88
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,361
<i>and he taught us all a lot</i>

89
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,906
about life, about what matters in life,

90
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,867
and, you know, how to enjoy...
enjoy yourself.

91
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,496
[Jake] <i>Was this his stuff or...?</i>

92
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,582
This is his stuff. These are--
Some of the stuff is stuff we gave him.

93
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,002
-[Jake] Oh, oh.
-[Margie] Look what I found!

94
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,044
[Chelsea] Oh, my God.

95
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,504
-[Margie laughs]
-[Jake] What?

96
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,839
[Chelsea] I can't...

97
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,340
[laughing]

98
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,301
Who's that?

99
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,511
-Ah, jeez.
-You guys are adorable.

100
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,888
[Margie] <i>Now my husband's gone,</i>

101
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,850
<i>I've got an empty house full of stuff.</i>

102
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,394
<i>Rick has monumental amount of stuff</i>

103
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,772
<i>that has accumulated from prior business</i>
<i>to present business</i>

104
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,482
<i>to inventions.</i>

105
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,027
<i>Any kind of creative ideas</i>
<i>he might have had.</i>

106
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,778
<i>It's so personal to him.</i>

107
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,656
I'm very strong-willed
and have good ideas,

108
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,658
but I don't know that I have

109
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,828
everything it takes, you know, er,

110
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:32,206
or just the fortitude it takes
to get rid of his belongings.

111
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,833
<i>But I'm alone now.</i>

112
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,961
<i>I lost my husband,</i>
<i>my kids all have moved out,</i>

113
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:40,381
<i>so,</i> <i>this is the perfect time for me</i>
<i>to make room for,</i>

114
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,550
<i>you know, whatever is next.</i>

115
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,471
<i>So, um, when Marie comes,</i>
<i>she's gonna kinda just get me started,</i>

116
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,474
<i>but she's not gonna be here,</i>
<i>this is gonna be my full-time job,</i>

117
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,683
<i>just cleaning my house.</i>

118
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,601
[Jake] Well, good.

119
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,313
It's a little daunting when you see
how much stuff we've accumulated.

120
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,774
I hope that Marie can help find

121
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,152
the same calmness and coziness

122
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,695
that I like in my house,

123
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,782
but maybe not
with all these things everywhere.

124
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,117
[Chelsea] Mom, are you ready to eat?

125
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,662
-I'll sit here. You sit at the head, Mom.
-[Margie laughs]

126
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,916
[Lucy] Oh, yeah, that's her chair.
It's been so long since a family dinner.

127
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,209
Well, it's kinda-- Yeah.

128
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,920
It is kinda weird
'cause we're missing several, so...

129
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,840
-Okay, guys. [sighs]
-Good luck with your new adventure.

130
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,717
Cheers to new beginnings.

131
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,260
Starting fresh.

132
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,221
Mmm, do I have your support, guys?

133
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,307
I-I-I hope you know
how much this means to me.

134
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,517
[Chelsea] Mm-hmm.

135
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,354
[quavering] You know, it's a lot of--
it's a lot of life in this house,

136
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,981
and I don't wanna just, you know, dump it.

137
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,901
-Yeah.
-I wanna to be thoughtful about it

138
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,986
and I don't want to get rid of...

139
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,489
important things or things that you wish--

140
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,741
oh, man,
we shouldn't have got rid of, so...

141
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,618
kinda, like, I need you to speak up

142
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,371
and kinda be here as I go through this.

143
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,331
-[whimpers] It's kind of emotional.
-Yeah.

144
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,167
I've been so strong, and it's, like,
this is really real now.

145
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,796
It's been a rough year,
but this is gonna be a good cleansing.

146
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,589
Okay, guys, so...

147
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,551
Lu, you do it.

148
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,845
Dear Lord, thank you for this meal

149
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,097
and that we can all be together

150
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,475
and please watch over us, and...

151
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,144
we're here for my mom

152
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,397
on this next chapter
and journey in her life.

153
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,691
In Jesus' name, amen.

154
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,942
-[Jake] Amen.
-Amen.

155
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,777
[in Japanese] <i>By tidying,</i>

156
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,280
you can sometimes ease
the pain of the past.

157
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:31,909
Or even start thinking about your future
in a more positive way.

158
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,412
Once we are done,

159
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,290
I have every faith that Margie's life

160
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,750
will spark with even more joy.

[Marie speaking Japanese]

163
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,315
[in Japanese] This house is so cute.
This is the house, right?

164
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,115
[doorbell chiming]

165
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,495
-[Marie] Hi!
-Hello, Marie.

166
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,121
Hello, nice to meet you.

167
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,748
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

168
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,833

-I'm so excited for you to be here.
-[Marie] Yeah.

171
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,172
[Marie whispers indistinctly]

172
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,633
So beautiful.

173
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,010
-Thank you. You wanna ride my pony?
-Yeah, yeah.

174
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,053
[Iida translating]

175
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:34,138
-Can I ride?
-[Margie chuckling]

176
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:36,224
[laughing]

177
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,683
Wow.

178
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,268
Only because she's little.

179
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,102
[Iida translating]

180
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,899
-This is just decoration?
-[Margie] Yeah, decoration.

181
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,943
-Yeah.
-Okay. Oh, it's so cute.

182
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,027
Yeah.

183
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,570
-[laughing]
-[Marie speaking Japanese]

184
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,113
It's the first time I've seen that.

185
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,365
Wow.

186
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:56,202
I've got lots of fun things in my house,
lots of special things.

187
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,703
-Wow.
-Yeah, so...

188
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,080
[speaking Japanese]

189
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,456
[Iida] I'm so happy to be here,

190
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,708
so I'd love it
if you could give me a tour.

191
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,503
-Sure. Not as happy as I am to have you.
-Yeah.

192
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,587
So come on in.

193
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:10,466
I can take you back into the,
the abandoned bedrooms from my children.

194
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,010
[Marie squeal, laughs]

195
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,179
[laughing]

196
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,098
That, That is the nervous cat.

197
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,183
-I have two, two cats.
-Two cats, okay.

198
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,644
-The other one is okay, this one, nervous.
-Nervous, okay.

199
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,354
I'm sorry. [laughing]

200
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,815
-So...
-Yeah.

201
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:30,069
My children are big and gone,
but we have lots of stuff left.

202
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,862
-So--
-How many children?

203
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,197
-I have three.
-Three, yeah.

204
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,658
And we keep talking about,
"We need to do this,"

205
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,577
and, "I'm too busy, Mom,"

206
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,414
so, for now, we just put it in here,
and close the door.

207
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,999
This is the dining room.

208
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,292
Yeah, yeah.

209
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,127
It looks so tidy. [chuckles]

210
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,338
My house is clean, it's just every drawer,

211
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,591
every closet is packed.

212
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,925
[Iida translating]

213
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,803
-Oh, what this? How this?
-Well...

214
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:56,971
-It's a drawer?
-[chuckling]

215
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,389
This is a catchall.

216
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,766
Anything you don't know where to put,
you put it in here.

217
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,311
Ah, okay.

218
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,105
[Margie laughing] She looks excited.

219
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,399
-Yeah, yeah.
-[Iida translating]

220
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:13,195
I am so excited because I like tidying
and I love mess.

221
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,573
Oh. Well, you came to the right house.

222
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:16,490
Yeah.

223
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,242
And this is my kitchen,

224
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,244
-[Margie] I live here alone.
-[Marie] Yeah.

225
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,621
[Margie] Look at all my stuff.

226
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,331
-[Marie gasps]
-[Margie laughing]

227
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,041
More stuff!

228
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,501
Oh!

229
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,171
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-I see.

230
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:34,133
[Margie] My husband loved condiments
and spices and sauces.

231
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,055
And this is what
my husband said to me every morning.

232
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,349
He called me Mag and he would always say,

233
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,309
"Good coffee, Mag!"

234
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,811
Okay, what do you wanna come see?

235
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,063
-Bedroom number two?
-Yes.

236
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,899
I think this is Lucy's stuff.
From when she was little.

237
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,275
-[Marie] Yeah.
-From school.

238
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,903
And then, also I have up here. [laughing]

239
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,155
-I haven't been up there in many years.
-[Marie] Yeah.

240
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,908
-So, I have a very big bedroom.
-Yeah.

241
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,494
This is all my husband's
and then this is all mine.

242
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,288
His things are still in the drawers
and then me.

243
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,040
-[Marie] Oh...
-[Margie laughing]

244
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,333
[Margie] Too much stuff.

245
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,918
[Marie speaking Japanese]

246
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,961
What about these shelves here?

247
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,005
-All kinds-- All kinds of things.
-Clothes, too?

248
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,007
-No, purses.
-[Marie] Ah, purse.

249
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,344
Sometimes I put--
I buy little things, like gifts,

250
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,263
and I just stick it up here. More candy.
[chuckling]

251
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,266
-[Iida] Candy.
-Yeah, but I don't go up here too much.

252
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,103
-Ah.
-This is where he had all his pants,

253
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,522
so I have them,
I have them, um, down there.

254
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,481
Yeah, yeah.

255
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,525
There's the, the jeans.

256
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,151
-[Marie] Yeah, yeah.
-See, see how big?

257
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,904
The pants are so big. This is so many...

258
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,322
so many pairs.

259
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,782
-[Iida translating]
-[Margie]Yeah.

260
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,993
And then we spend a lot of time--
This is our family room.

261
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,912
Oh, wow.

262
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,539
[Iida translating]

263
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,083
-So cool.
-Yeah.

264
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,419
[in Japanese] There's a very good energy.

265
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,462
[in English] This is all of your books?

266
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,673
-Or the--
-I have more. [laughing]

267
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,091
[Iida translating]

268
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,676
-Some of them.
-Yeah, some of them.

269
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,595
Some are my husband's.
My husband saved everything.

270
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,264
[speaking Japanese]

271
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,725
[Iida]
So, when did your husband pass away?

272
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,226
-Nine months ago.
-Nine months ago.

273
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,978
-Last summer, last June.
-Yeah.

274
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,522
I have to make room going forward.

275
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,024
-I can't just only live in the past.
-Yeah.

276
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,776
[speaking Japanese]

277
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,697
[Iida] So, yes, I think you will find
that this opportunity

278
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,367
for us to work together is really a time
for you to reflect upon your life

279
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,369
and start tidying
and organizing your life.

280
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,581
-I want to keep lots of memories still.
-Yeah, yeah.

281
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,915
[speaking Japanese]

282
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,585
[Iida] But I would like to value
how you feel

283
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,837
about your past and your memories.

284
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,714
Of course. Thank you, thank you.

285
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,340
[Margie sighs]

286
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,178
Well, I'm thanking you for sitting down
and not running out the front door

287
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,804
going, "Ah! This is too much!"

288
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,389
[speaking Japanese]

289
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,643
So, this is where we begin,
where we start our tidying process.

290
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,938
I'm ready.
I have really kind of stated to everybody,

291
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,484
this year, for me,
is my year to tidy up my whole life.

292
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,528
So, I've been through an awful lot
and I'm...

293
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,784
I've learned a lot, I'm amazed
how strong I have been through it all,

294
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,996
and I, I feel like I've got the energy
and the desire to really

295
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,416
prepare for what's to come next,
whatever that might be.

296
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,501
[speaking Japanese]

297
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,253
[Iida] I feel so fortunate to be able
to go on this journey with you.

298
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,589
Thank you. That makes me...

299
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,299
That makes me very happy.

300
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,592
[speaking Japanese]

301
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,345
[Iida] After you finish tidying,
do you have an image

302
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,430
of what kind of life
you would like to lead?

303
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,809
Yeah, I-I would like to travel again,

304
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,187
that's really one of the things
on my list, is to travel,

305
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,273
'cause I, I have relatives in fun places
around the world.

306
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,984
Also, I would like to have
a spare room devoted

307
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,362
as a craft room or, you know,

308
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:44,990
a place for me just to have
all my supplies,

309
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:49,286
and in one room,
in one spot, organized neatly.

310
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,371
[speaking Japanese]

311
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,457
[Iida] So, those images
are very, very important,

312
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,336
but the most important step is to have
an image of your ideal lifestyle

313
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,797
that you want to lead
once you've finished tidying.

314
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,173
Clearer the image, the better.

315
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,091
[Margie] Okay.

316
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,343
[in Japanese]
Before we start tidying...

317
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,512
[in English]
I would like to greet your house.

318
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,265
-Okay. How do you do that?
-[chuckling]

319
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,724
Er, don't worry about me.

320
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,269
-This is just for her.
-Oh, it's-- it's her--

321
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:14,895
-Yeah, yeah.
-Okay.

322
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,857
I find the best place to...

323
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,285
Okay.

324
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,245
Ah, this is okay.

325
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,168
[peaceful music playing]

326
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,407
-[speaking Japanese]
-[Margie laughs]

327
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,617
[Iida] Thank you so much.

328
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,036
[Marie speaking Japanese]

329
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,414
[Iida] I will tell you,
the feeling in this house is spectacular.

330
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,542
So, what I'd like for you to remember
as you go through this process

331
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,921
is that you're not alone,
the house itself and all your belongings

332
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,256
are there to support you and are with you.

333
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,300
Yes, they are. [laughing]

334
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,802
-[in English] Let's start tidying.
-[laughing]

335
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:37,770
All of your clothes
and put them in a pile on your bed.

336
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,731
-[Iida] <i>Take out all of your clothes</i>
<i>and make a mountain on your bed.</i>

337
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,775
Okay. This is hard to do.

338
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,860
[Marie] Yeah. Is this yours or...?

339
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,528
-That's Rick's.
-Okay.

340
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,447
-Just yours this time.
-Yeah.

341
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,824
-This end we leave for now.
-Yeah.

342
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:51,784
And this...

343
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:56,205
[in Japanese]
I always recommend that clients wait

344
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,874
to tidy belongings of a loved one
until the end.

345
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,921
The reason is because
tidying those items is very difficult.

346
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,882
<i>So there is a high chance</i>
<i>that it will stall the tidying process.</i>

347
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,968
[indistinct chatter]

348
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,804
Gonna make a mountain.

349
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,518
[Iida] Thank you.

350
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,104
It looks different when you see it
thrown on your bed like that.

351
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,230
I know.

352
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,690
[Margie laughing]

353
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:26,402
-Oh, this is mortifying.
-[Marie] Yeah.

354
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,528
Oh, my God.

355
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,280
[Margie] It's gonna be up to the ceiling,
I have a feeling. Oh.

356
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,533
-Wait, [stammers] ...you need to...
-Yeah!

357
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,867
[laughing]

358
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,953
-That was a workout, look at this.
-Yes.

359
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,746
-Look at it, it's just...
-[Iida translating]

360
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,708
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] So, this is the start.

361
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,293
[in English] Hold each item one by one

362
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:48,215
and choose item that spark a joy for you.

363
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,175
Um...

364
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,554
[laughing] I just...

365
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,683
Oh, my God! That's all I keep saying.

366
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:01,061
So, you'll be able to be more attuned
to what sparks joy for you

367
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,605
if you start with something
that you obviously like

368
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,897
and you wear all the time,

369
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,067
you're just 100% sure
it sparks joy for you.

370
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:12,448
My two robes, my three robes.
These couple of things I wear a lot.

371
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,826
This has sparked joy for you.

372
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,244
-Yeah, those are my cozies.
-Okay.

373
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,374
This one, I-I have had this
since I was nursing babies.

374
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,626
My youngest is almost 26.

375
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,086
-[Iida translating]
-[laughing]

376
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,963
But it's okay, I can say goodbye.

377
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,549
[in Japanese] If you are letting go
of an item

378
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,301
that you have a lot of memories of,

379
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,636
that's when you want to say
thank you from your heart.

380
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,765
I know, thank you, thank you. Lots of--

381
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,684
I can't believe how long this lasted,
so many years.

382
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,144
-But...
-[Iida] Yes.

383
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,646
...this is-- this chapter is behind me.

384
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,356
-Yeah.
-So, thank you.

385
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,192
I'm just, um...

386
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,320
[deep sigh] ...feeling a little bit like,

387
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,906
"Wow, this is gonna take me a long time."

388
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,658
<i>I would love to be doing it with Rick,</i>

389
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,954
<i>I mean, there's really nobody else</i>
<i>I could choose to do this with.</i>

390
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,832
<i>He was so capable of so many things,</i>

391
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,710
and now it's kind of like
smacking me in the face with,

392
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,755
"Okay, he's not here.
What are you gonna do now?"

393
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,841
[Marie, in English]
<i>How do you feel now?</i>

394
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,094
It was more than I thought
it was gonna be.

395
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,387
-First of all the amount of stuff.
-Yeah.

396
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,433
But it was easier than I thought
in the sense... [sighs]

397
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,644
I can do without that, you know?

398
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,855
I've-I've been through
some serious battles lately,

399
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,275
so, making decisions
about clothes is very, um...

400
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,570
Well, quite a bit easier than I thought.

401
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:34,863
[speaking Japanese]

402
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,699
[Iida] Yeah, I was surprised how smoothly
you made the selection,

403
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,118
so I think it's going very well.

404
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,036
Thank you so much.

405
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,831
-Can I give you a hug?
-Yeah. Thank you, thank you so much.

406
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:44,873
[laughing]

407
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,254
[birds chirping]

408
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:03,851
[Margie] <i>My life has transformed</i>
<i>just completely, um,</i>

409
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,144
<i>in the last year.</i>

410
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,438
<i>You know, when you choose a person</i>
<i>for 40 years,</i>

411
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,108
<i>you know, you want to be</i>
<i>with that person, and...</i>

412
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:14,486
it's a big void in the house
and in my life,

413
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,364
and I honestly have never lived alone.

414
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,658
[sighing]

415
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,451
Oh, my God.

416
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:26,415
<i>I do hope that this will allow me</i>
<i>to have, um,</i>

417
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,418
<i>some thoughts about what can I do,</i>
<i>what do I want to do,</i>

418
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,838
<i>the things that I haven't actually</i>
<i>allowed myself to think.</i>

419
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,840
<i>I want to be able to fantasize about</i>

420
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,259
<i>how do I wanna decorate the bedroom,</i>
<i>for example.</i>

421
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,346
<i>Or how would I redo this</i>
<i>and I have a hard time making decisions.</i>

422
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,933
<i>But, um, it's all on me now,</i>
<i>I don't have to run it by anybody.</i>

423
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,895
And that's an experience, I guess,
I have never had before,

424
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,772
where it's just solely me
making my decisions.

425
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,485
[craw cawing]

426
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,241
[Marie humming]

427
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,243
[doorbell chiming]

428
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,378
-[Marie] Hi!
-Good morning!

429
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,797
-Good morning. Nice to see you.
-Hello.

430
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,049
Hello.

431
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,634
-Welcome back.
-Yeah.

432
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,845
-Come on in. Hi, Iida.
-Good to see you again.

433
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,597
-Thank you.
-Welcome, welcome.

434
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,640
Yeah.

435
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,642
[laughing] Has it been a week?

436
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,978
[Margie] You want to come see
what I've been up to?

437
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:30,979
[Marie] Yeah.

438
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,857
[Margie] This is what I'm getting rid of.

439
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,442
-[Marie gasps]
-[Iida translating]

440
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,403
Look at all those bags.
Those are all gonna go, yeah.

441
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,614
-And all these purses.
-[Marie] Yeah.

442
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,158
I don't even know
where some of these purses are from,

443
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,328
I don't remember them, they've been
up there so long in my closet.

444
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,956
[Margie] What I'm wondering is,
what do I do now?

445
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,250
This is all I am keeping from my purses.

446
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,336
Do I need to get a container
to put them into, maybe?

447
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,463
-[in Japanese] If you have a container...
-A basket?

448
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,924
[in Japanese]
...or basket, that would be great.

449
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:09,351
[in Japanese] Many people feel that
there isn't enough space to store bags.

450
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:14,439
So I suggest the "Bag in Bag" Method.

451
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,109
[speaking Japanese]

452
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,964
Okay, so I just have to basically get

453
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,551
started on getting Rick's items
out of the drawers,

454
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,846
so that I have more room to finish
putting my things away, I suppose.

455
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,140
[Marie speaking Japanese]

456
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,101
[Iida] So, what's important
for you to do right now

457
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,812
at this stage is to really
just focus on yourself.

458
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:57,190
You can set aside Rick's clothes for now,
we'll come back to that.

459
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,775
-Okay.
-We'll take the steps to do that.

460
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,485
I don't want to jump ahead of the process.

461
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,488
I-- I'm learning, so, okay.

462
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:07,075
I do associate things
with memories for sure.

463
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:11,371
<i>It's hard to stay on focus 'cause I've got</i>
<i>Rick's items still to be dealt with.</i>

464
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,207
<i>I don't want to constantly</i>
<i>be thinking about that</i>

465
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,001
<i>every time I get dressed in the morning.</i>

466
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:21,048
<i>I'm definitely anxious,</i>
<i>but I have to trust Marie's process.</i>

467
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,549
[speaking Japanese]

468
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,635
-Okay.
-[Iida] The next on your step is books.

469
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,553
Okay.

470
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,806
[Iida] With books, we follow
the exact same process as clothes.

471
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,142
We will be gathering all the books
in the house,

472
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,061
and going through them one by one.

473
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,437
Ooh!

474
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,234
[Margie] I will literally just
stand up here and climb it.

475
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,569
-Okay.
-[Margie laughing]

476
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,196
-This is all built in.
-Ah, built in.

477
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,739
-[Iida] Okay.
-[Margie] Yeah.

478
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,117
[Marie speaking Japanese]

479
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,829
I think these are, um,
Rick's cowboy books.

480
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:56,166
When we used to go on vacation,
he'd always read an easy cowboy book.

481
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,168
So, do you like to travel?

482
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:02,589
Yeah, I used to work for the airlines,
so we did a fair amount of traveling.

483
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,757
[Marie] Yeah, yeah.

484
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,926
That's a keeper.

485
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,598
[Marie speaking Japanese]

486
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:14,351
How do you feel looking at all these--
all the books?

487
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,854
I feel like I'm in
somebody else's library, [laughs]

488
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,399
...'cause I don't know
what a lot of this stuff is.

489
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,276
[speaking Japanese]

490
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,403
[Iida] So...

491
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,322
So, before I start...

492
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,740
-Gotta wake 'em up?
-Exactly.

493
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,992
-Wake up the piles.
-[Iida] Before I start tidying books,

494
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,661
I like to wake them up a little bit.

495
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,538
It's a little easier to sort through.

496
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,249
[Margie] Um, okay...

497
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,753
[laughing]
How do I decide what I want to keep?

498
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,171
[speaking Japanese]

499
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,257
It's perfectly natural to feel anxious.

500
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,385
Just start with something easy,
you obviously don't want.

501
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:52,889
Okay. But I'm-I'm wrestling with
not feeling finished up there.

502
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:57,227
I feel like I'm jumping
into something else and I'm not done.

503
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:01,064
I was sort of prepared
to pull all of Rick's things out.

504
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,023
Yeah, yeah.

505
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,860
I-- I mean, it's not gonna be
the easiest thing,

506
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,153
but I'm tough and I'm...

507
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,822
I'm not gonna be tough now. [chuckling]

508
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:12,784
But I really think
I was mentally preparing for that.

509
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:17,122
So, I... I sort of feel like
I wanna kind of

510
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:20,125
finish before I jump into the next thing.

511
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,838
[in Japanese] I understand.
Let's shift the rules for you, Margie.

512
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,966
That-That-That I think
that would make me feel comfortable.

513
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:31,595
[in Japanese] I'm so happy that I was able
to understand you a little bit better.

514
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,721
[Marie speaking Japanese]

515
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,347
[Iida] You know, I am here to help you,

516
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:38,393
so whenever you need help or you're stuck,
call on me and I'll come right over.

517
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,436
[Margie] Thank you.

518
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,564
[in Japanese] Normally when we work
on sentimental items too quickly,

519
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,441
we become stuck,

520
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,611
because our ability to determine...

521
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,655
what sparks joy

522
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,868
has not been sufficiently honed yet.

523
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,704
But this was a very special case,

524
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:00,540
so I allowed Margie to work...

525
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,211
on some sentimental items first.

526
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:08,965
I offered to help Margie tidy
Rick's clothing with her,

527
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,677
but she expressed her wishes
to tidy his clothes alone,

528
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,347
so I trusted her to do that on her own.

529
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,891
[Margie] Okay. Thank you again.

530
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,309
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

531
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,686
-[Iida] Goodbye, see you soon.
-Enjoy the beautiful day.

532
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,146
Okay, bye.

533
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,402
[melancholic music playing]

534
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,801
[Margie sighs]

535
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,935
[sniffling] This is kinda hard.

536
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,398
[crying]

537
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,085
[crying continues]

538
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,689
[Margie sobbing] <i>You know, I looked at</i>
<i>those shirts and I thought</i>

539
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:51,109
<i>of all the hopes and dreams</i>
<i>he had while he...</i>

540
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:55,447
<i>you know, was in his Hawaiian shirt phase,</i>
<i>and then it went into the cowboy phase.</i>

541
00:26:56,656 --> 00:27:00,201
<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>it's just kind of a real jolt</i>

542
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,788
to see all this life, you know,
that we've lived,

543
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,040
and the dreams that he had

544
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,293
and, you know, they are now
in a pile on the floor,

545
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,253
and my closet is empty.

546
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,214
And that,
that was a very big jolt for me today.

547
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,977
[gentle piano music playing]

548
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,035
It was-- It was a difficult process
for me, I...

549
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,745
More so than I expected.

550
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,414
And seemingly kind of final.

551
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,334
I've been so good throughout this

552
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,295
and I've been looking at it so long
and just wanting it to go away,

553
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,090
but I guess it's just that final...

554
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:56,675
final chunk of...

555
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,469
you know, what's so visibly him.

556
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,933
<i>Evidently, there's lots of him</i>
<i>in the house and I've got all his...</i>

557
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,977
<i>papers and belongings otherwise,</i>

558
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,772
<i>but, you know, the clothes are</i>
<i>a very physical thing.</i>

559
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,236
<i>His-His presence was so big,</i>
<i>his clothes are so big,</i>

560
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,029
<i>his shoes are so big,</i>

561
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:22,158
and it's just very noticeable
he's not there.

562
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,326
[sniffs]

563
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,165
[sighing] Okay.

564
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,255
Ah.

565
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:36,798
[sniffling]

566
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,342
[car door opens]

567
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,553
[car door shuts]

568
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,555
-[Margie] Hi.
-[woman] Morning. Hi.

569
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,931
[Margie] Hi. I'm Margie.

570
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:49,144
-I have a big donation for you.
-Margie? Thank you. We love it!

571
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,604
-It's amazing what I'm getting rid of.
-Okay.

572
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,273
Clothing? Oh, you've got a lot of things.

573
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:55,525
-I do, do you have room?
-Perfect, yes. [laughing]

574
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,069
Absolutely.

575
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:00,947
[Margie] <i>I did it.</i>

576
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,032
<i>That truck was packed,</i>

577
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,369
<i>and, um, a lot of life,</i>
<i>a lot of memories and...</i>

578
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:10,331
You know, and my head is full
of 40 years of memories.

579
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,836
[whimpers]
So, I have that, no one can take that.

580
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,591
<i>It's gonna feel good when I drive off,</i>
<i>I'm just... </i>[deep sigh]

581
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:23,178
...a lot-a lot, a lot!
Getting to this point was a lot of work,

582
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,347
it was a lot of memories,
it was a lot of emotions,

583
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,726
and I want to only remember the good.

584
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,487
[birds chirping]

585
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,159
-Hi, hi, hi. How was your weekend?
-[Lucy] Hey.

586
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:49,329
[Lucy] Good. I want to see the closet now.

587
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,456
-[Margie] Oh, You haven't seen it. Okay.
-No.

588
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:55,168
-[Lucy] Whoa, that's creepy.
-Isn't it?

589
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,961
[imitating echo] Hello!

590
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:00,006
-Aww. That's sad.
-I know.

591
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:03,134
I know, it's-- it's really impactful
when you see...

592
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,094
-Yeah.
-...all his stuff out of here.

593
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,807
I-I kept one long flannel<i> </i>and his jacket

594
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,475
and I still have some of his boots.

595
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,686
I finally am feeling really different.

596
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,023
I feel proud of myself, you know?

597
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,192
I-I-I always told Rick,
"You're making me lazy,"

598
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,152
because he does things so well,

599
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,404
and does so much that I don't have to.

600
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,949
Not that I couldn't, but I never had to.

601
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:30,537
And now I enjoy
that I know I can if I need to.

602
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,206
[birds chirping]

603
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,505
[doorbell chiming]

604
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,096
-Hi, hello.
-Hello!

605
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,389
Welcome back, girls!

606
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:52,642
Hi. Oh, my God! You look so beautiful!

607
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:56,062
Thank you, thank you.
It's like, you know, the weather change.

608
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,438
Yeah, summer.

609
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,566
Yeah. So how's everything?

610
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,484
-[Iida translating]
-Good.

611
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,570
Well, come on in.

612
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,780
[in Japanese] The next thing I am thinking

613
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,701
about having you tackle is
the room that used to be your kid's room.

614
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,205
[Marie speaking Japanese]

615
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,332
Okay, so this room...

616
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,209
[Marie speaking Japanese]

617
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:22,213
It seems like it's a little more tidy
than the last time I was in here.

618
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,798
Did you go through them all?

619
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,260
Well, I-I have been taking things
and adding things and...

620
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:31,014
Yeah. I-- Maybe I was trying
to group things, too, maybe a little bit.

621
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:34,851
Um, just dealing with upstairs
was very emotional for me,

622
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:38,605
more difficult than I was expecting,
to deal with Rick's stuff.

623
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,858
[Marie, in Japanese]
Regarding the tidying process,

624
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,027
I understand that you've overcome
a very major step.

625
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,697
I'm very proud of Margie
for her accomplishments.

626
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,616
I felt very deeply

627
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:54,621
what a significant presence
Rick was in Margie's life.

628
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:58,666
I also felt that she's now ready
to continue tidying,

629
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,377
so I would like to continue
the lesson with her.

630
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,463
[speaking Japanese]

631
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:08,009
Okay, so we're gonna start looking
at miscellaneous items in this room.

632
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,177
-One by one.
-Okay.

633
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,720
[Marie speaking Japanese]

634
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,557
[Iida] The things that you want to keep,
like the scrapbooks, the craft equipment,

635
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,726
all those you want to keep,
keep them confidently.

636
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:19,020
Okay. [takes a deep breath] Alright.

637
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,564
[Margie]
This is a treasure hunt in here, girls.

638
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,734
-Do you want these?
-No, no.

639
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,153
[laughing] I don't know what they are.

640
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,990
You guys have first dibs
on any of my fabulous junk.

641
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,410
[Margie] Well, for $1.89 instead of $19.

642
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,038
-Ah!
-That's where I get myself in trouble.

643
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,874
I'm ready to run away from home!
[laughing]

644
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,544
This is the worst I've experienced so far.

645
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,588
[Margie] <i>I'm a closet stasher.</i>

646
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,799
[laughing] <i>I'm fessing up.</i>

647
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,218
The secret is out and I'm owning it

648
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,637
and I don't want
to feel like this anymore!

649
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,265
-Oh, God. How do I know?
-[Marie, in Japanese] Yes, you will.

650
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,475
Or do I get rid of it now,

651
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:00,311
and if I need it again,
I go spend 99 cents and buy a new one?

652
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,521
Well...

653
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:04,565
I don't know, you guys.
Help me out, help me out, I don't know.

654
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,651
[speaking Japanese]

655
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,362
So, if you feel overwhelmed, just...

656
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,156
take a moment to breath in and out.

657
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,036
I know, the decision making is very mental
and it makes you weary.

658
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,746
[speaking Japanese]

659
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,417
Okay. So, if you're unsure,
let's keep it for now.

660
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,919
[Margie] <i>It was a good feeling to know</i>

661
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,464
<i>that Rick's clothes is a closed book now</i>

662
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:32,010
<i>and I can move forward</i>
<i>with this process, but, um,</i>

663
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,596
<i>I realized soon enough</i>
<i>that I have so much to do,</i>

664
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,599
and to have it all on me

665
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,601
is just-- Aah!

666
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,854
I felt like, "Wow."

667
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,564
<i>It's overwhelming.</i>

668
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,358
<i>There's so much to deal with</i>
<i>and so many decisions</i>

669
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,694
<i>and I don't know how I'll get it done.</i>

670
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:50,611
<i>I really don't.</i>

671
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,280
I gotta figure out a lot of stuff.

672
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,616
-Uh, and there's so, so many.
-[Iida translating]

673
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,578
[deep sigh]

674
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,955
[speaking Japanese]

675
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,710
[Iida] So, I think going forward, Margie,

676
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,920
your challenge will be
just tackling each item

677
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,882
one by one, calmly,

678
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,009
and you are an expert already

679
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,762
at identifying what sparks joy for you
and what doesn't.

680
00:34:15,844 --> 00:34:17,889
You've already done that so many times.

681
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:21,141
You've come so far and there's
so much storage space in this house,

682
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,895
so don't try to focus
on what you need to eliminate.

683
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,523
You know, focus on what you wanna keep
and how you want to store them.

684
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,984
-That should be your focus.
-[Margie] Okay.

685
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,321
[Margie] <i>I have a lot of work to do,</i>
<i>but I've gotta try...</i>

686
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,697
<i>things on my own</i>
<i>that I've never done before.</i>

687
00:34:35,947 --> 00:34:37,867
<i>I guess that's what this is all about.</i>

688
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:41,079
<i>You know, preparing myself</i>
<i>for my next chapter.</i>

689
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:43,539
<i>It stresses me that there's just so much.</i>

690
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,958
But I am sucking it up,
I'm gonna be tough and get it done.

691
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,712
-Thanks for all your help.
-Thank you!

692
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:50,797
Okay, you guys.

693
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,255
-I'll see you soon.
-Safe travels.

694
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,382
[Iida] Thank you.

695
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,806
[Margie] <i>Okay, empty shelves.</i>

696
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:04,936
And I still have some more spices to go,

697
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,565
in addition to all of this
that I already pulled out.

698
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:13,069
A lot of the stuff that we had here
was for Rick's kind of cooking,

699
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,946
so, I am going to figure out

700
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,365
what sparks joy in my life

701
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,450
at this moment going forward,

702
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:22,453
and what kind of cooking
am I gonna be doing.

703
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,539
Woo!

704
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,873
[clattering]

705
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,460
Okay, this is a lot of stuff,
I've gotta go get a basket.

706
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,632
Who knows what's in my chemical closet?

707
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,135
This is a couple of years old.

708
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,929
<i>I'm surprisingly feeling perky today</i>

709
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:43,057
<i>'cause I've had a grueling week,</i>
<i>I have been at it,</i>

710
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,892
<i>cleaning and sorting</i>

711
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,060
and making decisions.

712
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,855
Um, and maybe it's just because

713
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,315
I see such progress, finally.

714
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,819
Oh, here's some towels
I haven't seen in a decade.

715
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,905
<i>Yeah, I'm getting the hang of it,</i>
<i>that's true.</i>

716
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,992
[Lucy] Am I doing up top or down below?

717
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,368
[Margie] Yes, please.

718
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,871
-Which one?
-[chuckling] All, all of it.

719
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:08,124
<i>I'm enjoying</i>
<i>just not answering to anybody</i>

720
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,585
<i>and not having to consult.</i>

721
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,712
<i>That's kind of exciting.</i>

722
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,423
I'm looking at my house with fresh eyes.

723
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,971
[Margie] So, I have a lot of photographs.

724
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,222
I need some help.

725
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,141
[Marie speaking Japanese]

726
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:28,311
Absolutely, I'd be delighted to give you
a lesson on photographs today.

727
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,437
-Okay. Okay.
-Yes.

728
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,527
[Margie] So, I have so many
photographs of 4th of July.

729
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,528
Hmm.

730
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,531
I have to look carefully,
like, how old were my kids, you know,

731
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,866
to try to find out the year.

732
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,534
These are all 4th of July.

733
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,953
[speaking Japanese]

734
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:49,790
[Iida] So, there are two ways to do this
and you can use both ways.

735
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,085
You can of course categorize by year,
but you can also categorize by events.

736
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,922
I did the same thing
when I was sorting though my photos.

737
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,342
-Okay, that's probably a lot easier.
-[Iida translating]

738
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,511
And then I have some, you know,
other miscellaneous...

739
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,639
-things that I've been saving.
-Of course.

740
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,766
[Marie speaking Japanese]

741
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,268
[Iida] Are these sentimental
items as well?

742
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,479
-[Margie] Yeah, yeah.
-Sentimental, miscellaneous items.

743
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:15,024
Yeah, so I, you know,
at least I have 'em in a box, but...

744
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,275
[Marie speaking Japanese]

745
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,612
[Iida] You, Margie, you have
so many amazing, cute, craft goods.

746
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:23,699
-You can make your own box that way.
-Oh, yeah, you know what? I could.

747
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,494
I could-- Or make the labels
to go on them, you're right.

748
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,411
[Iida] Absolutely.

749
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:36,254
[in Japanese] Store sentimental items
in a way that sparks joy.

750
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:40,675
For example, store them
in a box that sparks joy.

751
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,551
[speaking Japanese]

752
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,237
[In Japanese] So, separate them

753
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:07,368
into the 80s, the 90s, the aughts...

754
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,120
[Marie speaking Japanese]

755
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,039
[Iida] It's very, very good mix
of everything here.

756
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,292
-[chuckling]
-[Margie] Yeah! Look at my hair!

757
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,419
-[laughing]
-[Iida translating]

758
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:19,255
-[Iida] 80s? Maybe 80s?
-Oh, 80s, 80s.

759
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,715
You know it's 80s.

760
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,425
Oh, God!

761
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,260
[speaking Japanese]

762
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:28,806
I think all the baby steps I have taken
has prepared me for this, this section.

763
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:34,437
It got through to me, as in some way
I learned how easy it was

764
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,523
to discard things, recycle things,
whatever it might be,

765
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,359
but I haven't had as difficult a time

766
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:43,237
parting with things
as I would have thought.

767
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,948
[Marie, in Japanese]
I can feel that the energy is brighter

768
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:49,327
and that you are enjoying your life more.

769
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:53,706
And congratulations on successfully
completing all the categories.

770
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:57,626
Thank you to my mentor
and mentor extraordinaire assistant.

771
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,754
[Margie] <i>In these last few weeks,</i>

772
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,797
<i>I think I'm getting a better sense</i>

773
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:05,634
<i>that I am definitely stronger</i>
<i>than I would ever have</i>

774
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,345
<i>admitted to being.</i>

775
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,931
So I-I, you know, that's why,
looking forward to the future,

776
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,934
what is out there for me? I, I don't know.

777
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,563
<i>I know I'm capable of so many things</i>
<i>and things that I have never considered.</i>

778
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,066
<i>So, you know, that makes it fun</i>
<i>to get up each day</i>

779
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,151
<i>and see what's gonna unfold.</i>

780
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,403
[upbeat music playing]

781
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:33,162
[Marie, in Japanese]
There's a lot of stuff out here.

782
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,873
[Iida, in Japanese]
There must have been a garage sale.

783
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:36,957
Ah!

784
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:40,461
[Marie, in Japanese]
This looks really antique.

785
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,546
[Marie] Oh!

786
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,883
[in Japanese]
There's containers over there too.

787
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,013
[doorbell chiming]

788
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,933
-Hi!
-[Marie] Hi!

789
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,143
-Hi.
-It's so nice to meet you!

790
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,895
[laughing]

791
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:01,440
Hello. This is my baby.

792
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,234
-[Marie] Oh!
-This is Lucy.

793
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:06,695
[Margie] Well, come on in!
We have a beautiful day here today.

794
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,572
[Iida] Yeah, it is beautiful out.

795
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,325
Where do you want to start?
I'll be happy to show you.

796
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,244
[speaking Japanese]

797
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,704
-Start with that room right there.
-Okay, lead the way.

798
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,665
[Iida] Can I take a peek
at the linen closet?

799
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,125
[Margie] Yes, linen closet.

800
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:23,796
[Margie] Tah-dah!

801
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,005
[Marie exclaims] Eh!

802
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,674
[Marie, in Japanese]
<i>It looks so neat now!</i>

803
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,092
[Margie] <i>All by myself!</i>

804
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,052
[Marie speaking Japanese]

805
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,223
[Iida] <i>The fact that you've mastered</i>
<i>how to store everything</i>

806
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:38,060
<i>to this level means you can work</i>
<i>with any space going forward.</i>

807
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,146
I'm realizing that through this journey.

808
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,689
[Marie speaking Japanese]

809
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,316
[Iida] Okay, so, on to the next room.

810
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,276
[Margie] <i>Okay.</i>

811
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,406
[Marie gasps happily]

812
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,241
[all laughing]

813
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,870
-[Marie squeals]
-Surprise!

814
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,539
[in Japanese] I am so surprised!

815
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,083
[Iida] My gosh, I'm floored!

816
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,502
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-[Margie groaning]

817
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,504
[Margie] <i>I've been working so hard!</i>

818
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,506
[Iida] <i>This is a completely</i>
<i>different room!</i>

819
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,216
-[Margie] <i>It is.</i>
-[Iida] <i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

820
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,636
[Margie] <i>I have been working so hard</i>
<i>and I wanted to surprise you!</i>

821
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,472
[speaking Japanese]

822
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:18,434
[Iida] I can't believe there's--
I can't believe you can touch the carpet!

823
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,645
-[Margie laughing]
-[speaking Japanese]

824
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,564
[Iida] I never thought I'd be able
to do this

825
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,025
and see this whole view of the carpet.

826
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:29,153
And that's my new hashtag, I wrote it.
"KonMargie."

827
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,363
[Margie] Similar, but different.

828
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,824
[Iida translating]

829
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,201
[laughing]

830
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,495
[speaking Japanese]

831
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:43,083
I think this will turn into a lovely room
for your hobbies and your passions.

832
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,252
-Well, I did it.
-[in Japanese] This room is complete!

833
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,714
[laughing]
I know. I just haven't slept in two weeks.

834
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,676
This process has been
very therapeutic, I think.

835
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,261
<i>In many ways.</i>

836
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,556
<i>It's sort of a rebirth for me.</i>

837
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,975
<i>This lovely old house</i>

838
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,479
<i>that there's been so many</i>
<i>wonderful memories shared here</i>

839
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,314
<i>and so many more to make.</i>

840
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,734
<i>And to see how it's gonna shift,</i>

841
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,695
um, is anybody's guess at this point.

842
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:14,782
<i>It is a little harder...</i>

843
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:18,244
<i>Actually, it was a lot harder</i>
<i>than I thought it would be for myself.</i>

844
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,829
<i>You're saying goodbye to a life</i>

845
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:24,416
<i>and all his attire was so representative</i>

846
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,753
<i>of our life together for so many years.</i>

847
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,046
<i>It was hard.</i>

848
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,259
But I-I have to think
that he would be proud.

849
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:37,388
I-I could just visualize him
in the family room,

850
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,974
in his spot, just sitting there,
with me...

851
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:44,019
spinning circles around him,
'cause that was often the way life was.

852
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,564
I hope he's amused and smiling down

853
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,900
and giving me the thumbs up, saying,
"You're doing the right thing."

854
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:54,029
<i>Unfortunately, Rick isn't here</i>
<i>to continue on</i>

855
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,323
<i>with the plans that we had made</i>

856
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,368
<i>and the dreams that we had</i>
<i>for our golden years,</i>

857
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,579
but I don't feel despair.

858
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:05,791
I feel, you know,
very happy for the life we lived,

859
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,835
and going forward,

860
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,754
I'm anxious and excited
for what lies ahead.

861
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,673
[speaking Japanese]

862
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,508
[Iida] So how do you feel, Lucy,

863
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,468
seeing how your mother
progressed through this

864
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:17,886
and made such huge strides?

865
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,555
[Lu] I am proud of her.

866
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:22,391
It's gonna be great for her to have a...

867
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:26,812
You can even feel the air
and the energy in the rooms has changed.

868
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:31,650
[in Japanese] Tidying Margie's home was
an unforgettable journey for me as well.

869
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,945
I was so moved by "KonMargie's" endeavors.

870
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,822
-Thank you again.
-[Iida] We'll see you soon.

871
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,782
Okay, bye.

872
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,909
-Bye!
-Nice to meet you.

873
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,871
[in Japanese]
I am so happy that I was able to assist

874
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,123
Margie spark joy
in the next chapter of her life.

875
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,876
[Marie, in Japanese]
I was moved deeply by this experience.

876
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,211
It almost made me cry.

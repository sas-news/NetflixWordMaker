00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,924
-Ah!
-[woman] She looks excited!

2
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:11,052
I'm so excited because I love mess.

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:14,347
[man] It's a never ending battle
to fight the clutter.

4
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,349
-[knocking]
-Oh!

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,019
I want things to be more simple.
I don't know how to fix it.

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,438
With the baby coming,
it's gonna be more chaos.

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,314
-[clattering]
-[gasping, squealing]

8
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,567
[man] Oh, my God! We have too much stuff!

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,028
Hello, I'm Marie Kondo.

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,279
[in Japanese] My mission

11
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,741
is to spark joy in the world
through cleaning.

12
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:33,950
Ching!

13
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,995
[narrator] <i>Best-selling author</i>
<i>and world-renowned tidying expert</i>

14
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:41,583
<i>Marie Kondo is dedicated to inspiring</i>
<i>the world to choose joy</i>

15
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,334
<i>with the KonMari Method.</i>

16
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,253
[in Japanese]
The KonMari Method is unique because

17
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:48,256
<i>I organize by category</i>
<i>rather than by location.</i>

18
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:51,718
In the KonMari Method, we tidy
five categories in a specific order.

19
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,386
[in English] First, is clothing.

20
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,096
-[Marie grunting]
-[laughter]

21
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,264
I can't reach.

22
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,849
Next, is books.

23
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,852
[Iida] Giving them a little shake
and wake them up.

24
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,479
Then, paper.

25
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,438
[man sighs] I can't do the papers.

26
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,690
[deep groan]

27
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,027
The largest category is <i>komono.</i>

28
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,614
<i>Komono </i>is kitchen, bathroom,

29
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,740
and garage.

30
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,868
Everything miscellaneous.

31
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,163
Finally, sentimental items.

32
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,999
It's kinda hard to let it go,
'cause I really like this one.

33
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,212
[sniffling] This is kinda hard.

34
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:30,131
I don't want to just, you know, dump it.

35
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,093
But I want to be thoughtful about it.

36
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,554
[man 2] <i>From the moment she</i>
<i>set foot in our house,</i>

37
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,473
<i>she had this presence to her.</i>

38
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,767
She wants to see this place turned around.

39
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,895
Marie brought a whole bunch
of joy upon our home.

40
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,313
This is amazing.

41
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,440
[girl] You're so cute! I love you!

42
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,734
You're so cute.
I love you, too. [laughing]

43
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,028
These are, like, happy, happy tears.

44
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,197
Thank you for what you've brought
to our home, really.

45
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,080
[woman] <i>Mushu, where are you?</i>
<i>Kitty, kitty, kitty.</i>

46
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,791
[sighing] I do not see Mushu.

47
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,460
[woman] Oh, no. That window was open.

48
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,005
Okay.

49
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,591
[woman]
Mushu, here, boy, Here kitty, kitty, kitty

50
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,926
Mushu?

51
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,470
Moosh, okay, boy, come here.

52
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,180
-[cat meows]
-Hello, sweetie. Come here.

53
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,141
Atta-- Come on.

54
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,392
Up we go, up we go.

55
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,309
Alright, gotcha.

56
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,271
Come on.

57
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,897
My name is Wendy Akiyama.

58
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,524
And I'm Ron Akiyama.

59
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,278
[Wendy] <i>We inherited the house in 1994.</i>

60
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,780
<i>Raised our children here.</i>

61
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,741
<i>But we are now empty-nesters.</i>

62
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,703
<i>But now the clutter,</i>
<i>it prevents me from having</i>

63
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,330
<i>what I would call a normal retirement.</i>

64
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,041
<i>So I want Marie Kondo's help</i>

65
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:51,838
to actually maximize
our enjoyment in this house.

66
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,673
Ditto everything she just said.

67
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,801
'Cause I'm her husband.

68
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,344
[Wendy laughing]

69
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,723
[Wendy] <i>Ron's family moved here in 1968.</i>

70
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,894
<i>My parents bought the house</i>
<i>on the street down below</i>

71
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,645
<i>at the same time that they were here.</i>

72
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,355
<i>Ended up marrying the boy next door.</i>

73
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,773
-[Ron] <i>Literally.</i>
-[Wendy] <i>Yep.</i>

74
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,483
We've been married for...

75
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,195
What did I--? Forty-two years.

76
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,279
Forty-two?

77
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,072
Seventy-six. Yeah, 42 years.

78
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,950
So, you know, we've gotten
to the point where,

79
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,204
you know, even if I come home and sit here
and we don't say one word to each other,

80
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,164
he's just watching TV and I fall asleep...

81
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,832
it's a great relationship.

82
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,876
We don't feel pressured to,
"Oh, how was your day?"

83
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:30,877
"Oh, how was your day?"

84
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,046
You know, it's-- there's just no pressure.

85
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,840
I feel like talking, I'll talk.
I don't wanna talk, I'm not gonna talk.

86
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,635
<i>You know? And there's no,</i>
<i>"Well, why aren't you talking to me?"</i>

87
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:43,056
<i>You know, so this is a great time</i>
<i>for us to tackle something new like this</i>

88
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,683
<i>where we're both going to be</i>
<i>involved together.</i>

89
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:47,727
What do you think?

90
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,853
[laughing]

91
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:49,812
It is.

92
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:50,813
Okay.

93
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:55,360
[in Japanese]
I have worked with many couples

94
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:59,322
who wanted to re-evaluate their life
after their children have left home.

95
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:03,284
I have every confidence that if
Ron and Wendy progress step by step,

96
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,246
they will be able to discover

97
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:10,541
what's truly important in their life.

98
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,885
[Marie, in Japanese] Which one?

99
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:21,803
Which one is it?

100
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,054
Oh, it's this one.

101
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,057
[Marie speaking Japanese]

102
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,686
[Iida, in Japanese]
Today are people of Japanese descent.

103
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,521
[Marie, in Japanese] Oh, really?!

104
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,106
The outside looks a little Japanese.

105
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,984
That's very Japanese.

106
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:39,279
But there's no name plate.

107
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,407
[doorbell chiming]

108
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,493
-[Marie] Hi!
-[Wendy] Hey!

109
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,495
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

110
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,873
-I'm Marie.
-Yes! Oh, yes, I know. [laughing]

111
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:55,211
-I am Wendy and this is my son, Russell.
-Hi, Marie, nice to meet you.

112
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,963
-What was your name?
-Iida.

113
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,424
-[Russell] It's Marie Kondo?
-Marie Kondo.

114
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,884
Kondo. Perfect. We're Akiyamas.

115
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,178
Yeah, we know-- [speaking Japanese]

116
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,264
Little bit. Yeah.

117
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,100
-I know a little bit English.
-All I'm saying is this job is gonna be,

118
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,311
-what is it, <i>taihen?</i>
<i>-</i>[Iida] It's okay.

119
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,479
Yeah, my husband is here somewhere.

120
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,565
-He'll be here in a minute.
-He might be in the back.

121
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,860
-I think he's in the backyard.
-He might be in the backyard, yes.

122
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,903
[Russell] Oh. Speak of the devil!

123
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,281
-Oh, gosh, there you are.
-[Russell laughing]

124
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,490
-Perfect.
-This is Ron.

125
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,492
Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Marie.

126
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,786
Yes, I recognize your face from...

127
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,330
from YouTube.

128
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,497
[laughing]

129
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,957
[speaking Japanese]

130
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:38,296
So I would love to get a little bit of
a tour inside your home, if that's okay?

131
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,881
My name is Russell, um,

132
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:43,968
<i>and part of the reason why I am here</i>
<i>is to help my mom,</i>

133
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:49,265
<i>because I think that there is a little bit</i>
<i>of hesitation and concern for my dad</i>

134
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,394
about the daunting mountain of things
my parents are gonna have to go through.

135
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,354
But, you know,

136
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,814
<i>even though he's a man of few words,</i>

137
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,651
<i>you know, being able to have</i>
<i>an activity like this with my mom,</i>

138
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:04,364
he and my mom can get to know
each other in this new process.

139
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,492
Cleaning the house was definitely--
wasn't my priority,

140
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,243
but it would definitely be hers.

141
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:14,874
[Ron] <i>I'm of the subscription</i>
<i>to happy wife, happy life, so I...</i>

142
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,878
I support whatever it takes
to have a clean house,

143
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,880
if that makes Mama happy.

144
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:24,842
So I'm just not 100% in it
because I don't know what it entails yet,

145
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,970
so... let's see what happens here.

146
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,562
-Okay, so master bedroom, Marie.
-[Iida translating]

147
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:40,441
And then this is what
we're dealing with here.

148
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,068
[Wendy] Baseball cards, Marie.

149
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,653
[Marie, in English] Baseball card!

150
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,822
[Russell]]
Those boxes all used to be white.

151
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,616
[Iida] So all of these belong
to your husband?

152
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,036
Yes, the kids worked
with my husband, collected cards,

153
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,955
so this is the end result.

154
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,334
[Wendy] <i>Ron is really perfectly willing to</i>

155
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,461
<i>have things be status quo.</i>

156
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,172
And maintaining the status quo

157
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,801
actually does inhibit you
from being creative

158
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,720
and having, um, different approaches

159
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,056
to solving the problems in your life.

160
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,935
If you're satisfied with the status quo
then nothing's gonna change

161
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,395
because you don't want change.

162
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:23,109
<i>So I hope it's never too late</i>
<i>to teach old dogs new tricks.</i>

163
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,110
[laughing]

164
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,198
[Wendy] This is not everything, Marie.

165
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,493
There's... [speaking Japanese]
There's much more.

166
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:33,703
More clothes?

167
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,912
Yes. Yes.

168
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,581
-Oh, you wanna see that next?
-Yeah.

169
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,711
[Wendy] So this used to be
a bedroom with a bed in it.

170
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,546
I see a lot of clothes
with tags still on.

171
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,840
[Wendy]
There's lots of things with tags, yes.

172
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:49,177
And one of the things I would like to see
for her retirement,

173
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,222
if we can transform this room
into her office.

174
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,141
[Marie speaking Japanese]

175
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,102
And I'd love to see the one
last place we have clothes.

176
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,397
Yeah, there's actually two more rooms
to look at in here.

177
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,399
Okay, this is Russell's old room.

178
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,276
Ah.

179
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,944
[Wendy] Those are all mine.

180
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,238
[Russell]
This is my little brother's room.

181
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,573
[Iida translating]

182
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,869
And there's more in the closet.
The disorganization is stressful.

183
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,330
[Wendy]
<i>I try to just bury it, not think about it,</i>

184
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,957
<i>to live with floor-to-ceiling boxes,</i>

185
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:24,420
<i>and to have a whole room of clothing</i>
<i>that is just kinda thrown over things.</i>

186
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,797
We can't find stuff
and that does bother me.

187
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,301
And I think that getting
that organized will help,

188
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:35,806
you know, to make this feel like the home
that I really would like to have.

189
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,145
[Russell]
So this way is the rumpus room, please.

190
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,438
[Marie inhales sharply]

191
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,482
[in Japanese]
Amazing, is this an activity room?

192
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,317
[Iida, in Japanese]
I'd say an activity room.

193
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,903
A room where you watch TV,
you play games,

194
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,072
and this is the Christmas collection

195
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:55,117
which I've been trying
to figure out how to put away.

196
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,495
[speaking Japanese]

197
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,748
[Iida] So, just wondering,
Christmas materials,

198
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,084
in the living room and all of this,
that's it, right?

199
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,961
No, and the kitchen. And the bathroom.

200
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,588
And there's some nutcrackers
that are still out, yeah.

201
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,967
My love of Christmas started
when I was a little girl.

202
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,344
<i>My mom, she was the one who</i>

203
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,764
<i>actually made it really special for us</i>
<i>as we were growing up</i>

204
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,891
<i>and I wanted to do the same</i>
<i>for my children.</i>

205
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,434
<i>Decorations were really important.</i>

206
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:24,355
<i>To me that was a big deal,</i>
<i>because now you know Christmas is coming.</i>

207
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:29,569
<i>And having the house, you know, decorated</i>
<i>for Christmas just makes me happy.</i>

208
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:30,945
It's nice.

209
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,531
[Marie speaking Japanese]

210
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,659
You have a lot of memorabilia,
keepsakes in here.

211
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,494
-Yes.
-Yes, yes.

212
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,288
-Oh, okay.
-[Marie squealing]

213
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,706
[laughing]

214
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,500
[Wendy] We're gonna go look
at the garage next. Yeah.

215
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,710
[Iida translating]

216
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,045
-After you. Go ahead.
-Oh!

217
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,007
-At least there's room for you to walk.
-[Marie] Garage.

218
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,593
-[Wendy] There is room. Oh, there you are.
-[speaking Japanese]

219
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,136
[Russell laughing]

220
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:59,223
-[Iida] I didn't expect him up there.
-Yeah, that's Mushu and Mulan.

221
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,352
This is where a lot
of everything ended up.

222
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,270
[Wendy] Yes.

223
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:10,735
We have no idea on how many boxes
are in the garage and what's in them.

224
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,155
[Wendy] <i>For most of its life,</i>
<i>the garage has been...</i>

225
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,865
<i>a clutter.</i>

226
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,326
<i>And we have...</i>

227
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:22,913
three generations
of belongings in this house.

228
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,750
It began with Ron's mom and dad.

229
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,629
<i>They brought their belongings</i>
<i>from their previous home.</i>

230
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,799
And now we have our children's items
which are still in this house

231
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,427
and Ron's items and my items.

232
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,512
[speaking Japanese]

233
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:44,310
I do think that it will take a significant
amount of time going through all this.

234
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,355
-[Iida] But you will finish.
-Yes!

235
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,315
-Okay.
-That's what I want to hear!

236
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,484
-Can I get a high five, Marie?
-[Marie] Yes!

237
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,777
-Here we go!
-[Marie squeals]

238
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,111
We're on.

239
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,988
[cat meowing]

240
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,658
[Marie speaking Japanese]

241
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,410
[Iida] So, just as I introduced
myself to you today,

242
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,871
I always also introduce
myself to the house.

243
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,957
I love that. I love that.

244
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,836
-I never thought of talking to our house.
-[Russell] We should.

245
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,547
-We should talk more to our house!
-Yes.

246
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,174
Yes, this is a good spot to do that.

247
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:18,844
And asking our house to cooperate with us?

248
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,721
-That's great.
-I love that.

249
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,474
[Russell]
Should we do-- Can we do that?

250
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,226
[in Japanese]
Can we kneel on the floor?

251
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,521
[Iida] Can you do <i>seiza?</i> Like this?
The Japanese proper way of sitting.

252
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,315
-I don't think so.
-[in Japanese] If you can't, that's okay.

253
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,820
[peaceful music playing]

254
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,060
-[speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] Were you able to greet it?

255
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,520
-Yes, I was.
-[Iida] Okay.

256
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,359
[in Japanese]
When tidying your clothes,

257
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:21,157
you will take everything out
and create one big pile.

258
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,784
This may seem like a hassle,

259
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,579
but please do not skip this step.

260
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:31,876
Only by creating one big pile

261
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,964
are you able to see how much clothing
you actually have.

262
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,759
You will also be shocked at the amount
of clothing you have.

263
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,261
By experiencing this shock,

264
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:47,600
you will finally be able to decide
what items are truly necessary for you.

265
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,399
-[Wendy] I'll do this bit.
-You really do own a load of jackets.

266
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,067
[Wendy] Yeah, I do. That's my weak point.

267
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,239
[Wendy] It just makes me feel good
that I have 'em.

268
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,117
[Russell] I think it'll make you feel good
to get the space back, too.

269
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:07,870
[Marie murmurs]

270
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,373
-Oh, sorry!
-Excuse me.

271
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,167
[Wendy] Here you go, now drawers.

272
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,002
[Marie, in Japanese]
There's truly a lot here.

273
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,509
[Wendy]
So, how long did it take, about an hour?

274
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,594
-[Iida translating]
-[speaking Japanese]

275
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,720
Just about.

276
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,600
[speaking Japanese]

277
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,310
[Iida] I'm going to be honest with you.

278
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,103
[speaking Japanese]

279
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,482
This is the biggest pile
I've seen of all my clients.

280
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,317
Yay! I win! [laughing]

281
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,694
-I don't know if that's how this works.
-Yay!

282
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,154
[laughing]

283
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,533
[Wendy] <i>For me, clothes are a passion,</i>

284
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,494
<i>an obsession, recreation.</i>

285
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:53,165
<i>Retail therapy is definitely something</i>
<i>I'm guilty of using.</i>

286
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,501
<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>whenever Ron and I would fight,</i>

287
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,003
<i>shopping was a diversion,</i>
<i>it was a way to, you know,</i>

288
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,548
just calm down, de-stress.

289
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:01,841
Um...

290
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:05,803
Maybe, you know, hit Ron where it hurts,
in his pocketbook.

291
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,638
I know! [laughing]

292
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,308
Holy cow, Ron!

293
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,520
-This is pretty bad.
-[laughing]

294
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,355
[speaking Japanese]

295
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,774
-He's working really hard.
-Holy moly.

296
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:19,692
[Russell] He is.

297
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:24,446
And just to-- to clarify
or to keep fresh in my mind,

298
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,909
the object isn't necessarily
to throw everything away,

299
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,662
it's to be-- it's like almost like--

300
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,206
Correct me if I'm wrong,
like reacquaint yourself...

301
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,542
-[Iida translating]
-...with your belongings.

302
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:40,796
[in Japanese]
What I really want you to ask yourself

303
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,885
is if it's something
you really want to take into your future.

304
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,803
-Yes.
-Yeah.

305
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,471
[speaking Japanese]

306
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,849
[Iida] So, your homework for this week

307
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,727
is to finish sorting
through all of your clothes.

308
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,936
Okay, great.

309
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,980
[in Japanese]
Thank you very much!

310
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,356
Thank you.

311
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,115
I'm kind of an old school,
macho kinda guy

312
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,367
and this isn't
something that I normally would do.

313
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,662
But, um, Wendy's kind of overwhelmed.

314
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:18,083
[Ron] <i>It's kind of unfair that her pile is</i>
<i>three or four times what my pile is.</i>

315
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,752
<i>But my thing is baseball cards,</i>

316
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:23,464
so I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get
the crack of the whip for that.

317
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,968
I love having all of this. I would not

318
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,137
just take the whole mountain
and just chuck it out.

319
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,640
I really love what I have.
I love clothing.

320
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,269
[Wendy] <i>But to put it,</i>
<i>everything all in one pile,</i>

321
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,646
<i>I've never done that before,</i>

322
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:43,943
and I've never seen the accumulation
of everything that I own that's clothing.

323
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,236
<i>So now I am overwhelmed.</i>

324
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,366
I'm gonna probably keep this one
'cause, again, I like the colors...

325
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:55,746
and it's really soft
and comfortable, so yes.

326
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,206
We will keep that one.

327
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,959
I'm starting from the bottom,

328
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,211
just throwing everything down.

329
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,006
I like it, I love florals, so...

330
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,884
we will probably
be keeping that one.

331
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,679
This is really heavy under--

332
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,347
Okay, I can't pull it out.

333
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,809
<i>When I was little,</i>
<i>I would make paper dolls</i>

334
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,727
and just design clothing for them,

335
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,105
piles and piles of clothing
and keep changing them.

336
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,440
<i>And so as I grew older,</i>

337
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,150
I became the paper doll.

338
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:29,113
<i>I still like to look at clothes,</i>
<i>I still like to try them on,</i>

339
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:32,658
<i>and, um, this is really hard for me to do.</i>

340
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,618
Okay, I like that one, too.

341
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,996
The anxiety part is...

342
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:41,583
trying to understand what I have
so that I can use it.

343
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,127
[Ron] Seen the top of the bed, yet?

344
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:44,878
[Wendy] Um, no.

345
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,338
I'm keeping a lot.

346
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,549
Well, yeah. I figured.

347
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,343
I have to make it go down.

348
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:55,222
I hope the next time
I see Marie that this is gone.

349
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,768
[Wendy]
<i>Are we just throwing this in a bag?</i>

350
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,145
-[Ron] <i>Yes.</i>
-[Wendy] <i>Okay.</i>

351
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,105
[Ron] Let's just get the process done.

352
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,150
You can walk when you get to Heaven,
so let's hurry up.

353
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,325
[knocking]

354
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,537
-Hi!
-Hello, Marie.

355
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:21,957
Good to see you. Iida, good to see you.

356
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,209
-[Iida] Hello again.
-How are you guys?

357
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:26,670
-Good!
-It's hot, hot, hot. [speaks Japanese]

358
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:28,589
[in Japanese]
It got really hot quite suddenly.

359
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:29,840
I've been taking out...

360
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,301
[deep sigh] Lots of <i>gomi.</i>

361
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,678
[Wendy] <i>Things that we let go that are--</i>
<i>should be trash,</i>

362
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,514
<i>and things that we're letting go</i>

363
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,934
that are gonna be donated are all
still piling up down here.

364
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,561
[speaking Japanese]

365
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,646
I had no idea there was an extra
room in there.

366
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,566
[Wendy] There's a bathroom there,
believe it or not.

367
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,401
See, look at it. There's a lot!
 [speaking Japanese]

368
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,695
-[Marie, in Japanese] There's a lot.
-[Wendy] It's a large pile. Again.

369
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,780
[laughing]

370
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,324
But this time these are things
that are going, right?

371
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:59,036
You want to see upstairs and I'll show you
how we completed our homework.

372
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,746
[in Japanese] Yes, please show me.

373
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,581
[Wendy] <i>So we'll start here.</i>

374
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,709
-<i>This is where we had everything piled.</i>
-[Marie] <i>Wow!</i>

375
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,669
[Marie, in Japanese] <i>It's wonderful.</i>

376
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,422
-You worked so hard!
-[squealing]

377
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,466
I did it. I did it. I got rid of a lot.

378
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,219
You know, it was easy on that one.
Yeah, lotta bags have gone.

379
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,971
So in here, sweaters was really huge, too.

380
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,265
[Marie speaking Japanese]

381
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,017
[Iida] Now that you've
tackled your clothes,

382
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,103
what kind of effect has it had
on the way you shop?

383
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,939
When I go through my emails that come
from all my favorite stores

384
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:30,776
and I'm going, delete, delete, de--
I'm not even opening the emails.

385
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,528
Even when it's a sale.

386
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,445
Big difference.

387
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,030
Yes. Yes, yes.

388
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,156
[Marie speaking Japanese]

389
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,951
[Iida] So, you've worked so hard
on the tidying clothes,

390
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,577
-I would love to move on.
-Okay.

391
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,751
[Marie speaking Japanese]

392
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,378
[Iida] Christmas decorations.

393
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,505
[Marie]
How do you feel looking at all of this?

394
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:54,341
Well, right now I don't feel really good
looking at all of them,

395
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:58,720
but once they're organized
into their own little cases,

396
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,598
it just makes me feel
really good that I have them.

397
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,351
[speaking Japanese]

398
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,061
What do you think of the quantity, though?

399
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,356
-Does this feel right for you?
-Yes, because we have a big house

400
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:13,360
and I like to have Christmas, like,
in the three main entertaining rooms.

401
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,904
So I feel I need this many

402
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,366
in order to bring Christmas
to all three of the main rooms.

403
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,785
[speaking Japanese]

404
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,539
[Iida] I don't recommended putting things
in plastic bags like this.

405
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:29,001
It starts to look like <i>gomi,</i> or trash.

406
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,466
[in Japanese]
Satsuki, these are Christmas decorations.

407
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,511
-[in English] And this one?
-[in Japanese] This one, too? Here you go.

408
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,681
My little girls love Christmas as well.

409
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:47,895
But I don't think they share
the same enthusiasm as Wendy.

410
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:51,148
Here are some tips
for tidying Christmas decorations.

411
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,692
Create one big pile.

412
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,277
Hold each item one by one.

413
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,197
Only keep the ones that spark joy.

414
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:02,910
I'm sure there are a lot of families
who use Christmas to decorate together.

415
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:06,496
In those situations, it would be great
if everyone did it together.

416
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,748
Hey, Satsuki.

417
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,209
[in English] Does this spark joy?

418
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,211
-Yeah.
-Yes.

419
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,004
[in Japanese] It sparks joy.

420
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,174
Here are some tips
on storing seasonal decorations.

421
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:21,178
First, do not store them in trash bags.

422
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:25,265
Put the decorations in a box.

423
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:29,102
For example, store them
in clear containers like this.

424
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:33,148
That way, it'll be easier
to see what's inside.

425
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:39,404
[Wendy] So this morning, Ron and I got up
at five o'clock in the morning

426
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:43,325
and we piled it on top of all the sofas

427
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,327
so that we have
more room here to work.

428
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,831
[Ron] Wendy is starting
to take apart Christmas.

429
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,291
And...

430
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,212
the infamous nutcrackers
are where she is--

431
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,129
Goodbye!

432
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,131
[Ron] Not necessarily where
she's starting, but--

433
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,551
I don't know if you remember,
but that was super full.

434
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,887
She's got these clear...

435
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,558
bins that I think
she was talking to Marie about.

436
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,771
Here's two bins
that she's already done.

437
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,191
[Wendy] <i>I really-- I love Christmas</i>
<i>and I do realize</i>

438
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:20,696
it was-- it was a little overboard here,
you know, with things just in every--

439
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,073
It almost looked like I was
selling the stuff.

440
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:29,413
So I learned that it didn't have to be
that extreme to look really festive.

441
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:33,792
So, um, I'm gonna change the way
I decorate this year.

442
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,880
[Ron] <i>Wendy started off with Mount Wendy</i>

443
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,342
<i>because the clothes was probably</i>
<i>the most daunting thing that she had.</i>

444
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:46,471
<i>And so the cards was gonna--</i>
<i>are gonna be my Mount Ron.</i>

445
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,267
Found Marino's rookie card.

446
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,937
And John Elway's rookie card.

447
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,065
<i>Baseball cards is something that</i>

448
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,818
<i>me and the kids have been</i>
<i>collecting for over 30 year--</i>

449
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,862
<i>I've been collecting</i>
<i>for longer than that,</i>

450
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,655
<i>but with the kids, over 30 years.</i>

451
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:08,285
<i>Going through this process, it has made</i>
<i>me think about things more,</i>

452
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:11,913
<i>about whether, does it make sense</i>
<i>for me to keep it,</i>

453
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,999
or does it make sense
for me to treasure it,

454
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:17,210
or does it make sense for me
to say thanks and get rid of it?

455
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,881
I never really thought that I would think
the way I'm thinking about baseball cards

456
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,799
now the way I am.

457
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,551
If I really think about it,

458
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,179
I only need to keep ten percent of it.

459
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,808
[Wendy] Oh, let's see. How is he doing?

460
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:33,810
Aww.

461
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,606
He actually conked out.

462
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:42,361
I'm looking, I mean look at
all this carnage here.

463
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,280
Believe it or not,
he has it under control.

464
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,657
It doesn't look like it, but he does.

465
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,706
[Ron] So we're gonna do
the fall stuff over here, right?

466
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,874
Yes.

467
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,130
[glass shatters]

468
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,340
[Ron] Clumsy, Wen.

469
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,801
I know, well, it wasn't
anything important.

470
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,971
[Marie, in Japanese]
There are a lot of things out here.

471
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,349
There's some more.

472
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:14,893
Hi!

473
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:15,936
How are you?

474
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,271
I'm so dirty! [laughing]

475
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,940
How are you, Iida?

476
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,442
-Come in. Come in.
-Hi, good to see you.

477
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,778
Good seeing you. Yeah, I know I'm not--

478
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,947
[Wendy]
So, you wanna see the garage?

479
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,825
-[Marie, in Japanese] Absolutely!
-[Iida] Of course. I can't wait.

480
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,035
[Marie speaking Japanese]

481
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:35,455
-You can see the other side!
-I know! Isn't it amazing?

482
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,333
-<i>Konnichiwa. </i>Hello Ron!
-[Ron] Hey. <i>Konnichiwa.</i>

483
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,877
[Marie speaking Japanese]

484
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:44,089
[Iida] So, did you guys discover
anything new about each other

485
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,341
while you were tidying this garage?

486
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,968
Well, what'd you call me, Ron?

487
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,636
-[Ron] <i>Gasa gasa.</i>
-I'm <i>gasa gasa.</i>

488
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,138
<i>-Gasa gasa!</i>
-[Wendy laughing]

489
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,306
He slows me down.
I kinda make him hurry up.

490
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,643
Ron's reaction to the thought
of going into this project

491
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,437
was, like, I guess what most men would--

492
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,440
like, "What's wrong with the way
things are right now?" You know?

493
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,192
"If it isn't broke, don't fix it."
[chuckling]

494
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,945
But now, he's enjoying it.
I think he's enjoying the results.

495
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:10,782
His creativity level just jumped,
you know, it just went onto the moon.

496
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,993
He's like, "Why don't we do this,
why don't we do that?"

497
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,787
[Wendy] <i>We're working together</i>
<i>to accomplish something</i>

498
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,498
<i>that we think is definitely</i>
<i>gonna be life-changing.</i>

499
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,585
I think since Marie's come here,

500
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:26,840
from the beginning to now, we're totally--
we look at this differently.

501
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,843
"Spark joy," that really is a...

502
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:31,678
a real thing.

503
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:35,974
[Wendy] It actually brought about changes
that we really didn't expect.

504
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,309
[Ron] That's true. That's true.

505
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,227
-[speaking Japanese]
-[laughing]

506
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,313
[in Japanese] Truly. Truly.

507
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,192
There actually is a side bonus
to all of this

508
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,736
and the side bonus is that...

509
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,405
um, we're working together.

510
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,742
Right, are you putting small,
big, how are you doing it?

511
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,995
Just anyway you can, but obviously
you don't wanna put smalls on the bottom.

512
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,206
It's kinda fun, actually.

513
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,833
What're you gonna do up there?
'Cause that's all gonna come out.

514
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,961
I think we still wanna put some
of the photographs and stuff up there.

515
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:08,632
From de-cluttering and cleaning
and working with Marie,

516
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,928
that Ron and Wendy are actually are
working together on a project like this,

517
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,221
it's kinda cool.

518
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,640
-[Ron] Okay.
-[Wendy] So, I think we're done.

519
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,439
[Wendy] <i>We can see the endgame right now.</i>

520
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,816
<i>And before it was kinda like,</i>
<i>"How are we gonna do it?"</i>

521
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,985
Because there was just
so much stuff in there.

522
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:32,364
<i>But now we've made tremendous progress</i>
<i>and we're gonna continue.</i>

523
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:37,369
<i>And so my motivation is</i>
<i>I never want to have to do this again.</i>

524
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:43,208
<i>We estimated, what,</i>
<i>150 bags of trash have left this house.</i>

525
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,418
A hundred and fifty.

526
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,797
Okay, so where do you want to start?
Top shelves or bottom shelves?

527
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,714
Um...

528
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:50,924
-Probably top shelves.
-Yeah.

529
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,551
Yeah. So-- Is that hair?

530
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,387
-[Wendy] What does it say?
-[Ron] "Russell."

531
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,805
[Wendy] Yeah, it's Russell's hair.

532
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,682
-First haircut.
-[Wendy] First haircut. Okay.

533
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,183
Nana kept that?!

534
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,896
[Ron] Holy crap.

535
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,482
This is April 1966.

536
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,192
Does that even look like me?

537
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,445
-That's you?
-Yep.

538
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,656
[Wendy]
<i>I mean, it almost looks like Russell.</i>

539
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,032
<i>Wow.</i>

540
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,953
There's gonna be a lotta things that we're
gonna find I know that are precious to us

541
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:23,498
and we have to come up
with a way to store them.

542
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:28,878
What we need to do is make a pile
of photos that we're gonna come back to.

543
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,385
[in Japanese] When tidying photos,

544
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:41,600
you must believe in your ability to know
what sparks joy for you.

545
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,560
Let's go through each one, one by one.

546
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,729
This one sparks joy.

547
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,147
This one doesn't.

548
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,189
This one does.

549
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,357
This one doesn't.

550
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,152
If you have similar photos,

551
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:55,405
keep the one that sparks the most joy.

552
00:26:57,198 --> 00:27:03,663
Photos can be stored in a box.

553
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,125
My recommendation is
to store them in an album.

554
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,254
This makes it easier
to enjoy the memories.

555
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:15,467
Some places to store your albums are
on bookshelves and coffee tables.

556
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,011
Please find a spot
that sparks joy for you.

557
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,014
Okay.

558
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,560
We kinda were thinking of the stages

559
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:29,564
and the sentimental was
definitely a part of the stage that

560
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,608
<i>I was looking forward to, honestly,</i>

561
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:36,279
<i>'cause I really wanted to see some of this</i>
<i>old stuff that I either have never seen</i>

562
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,574
<i>or haven't seen for a long time,</i>
<i>and by a long time I'm talking...</i>

563
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,660
-Fifty years.
-Yeah, fifty years.

564
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,745
I'm pretty sure this was my father's.

565
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,830
-[Marie] Hmm.
-When I started looking into it,

566
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,834
this is December 7th, 1941.

567
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,128
-That was Pearl Harbor.
-[Iida translates]

568
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:55,465
And then he begins to tell

569
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:58,885
that they were gonna be interned
at Santa Anita Racetrack.

570
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,221
And what happened to them, you know,

571
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,098
right after the break of World War II.
So...

572
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,058
[Marie speaking Japanese]

573
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,186
[Iida] This is an item
that should be cherished.

574
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,813
-[Ron] Yeah.
-[Iida] Absolutely.

575
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,690
[Ron] <i>There's a lot of memories</i>
<i>in this house.</i>

576
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:15,443
<i>There's a lot of emotional stuff</i>
<i>that we found that took us back.</i>

577
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:19,030
<i>You know, we've found more things</i>
<i>that have brought value to us</i>

578
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,032
<i>that are worth absolutely nothing</i>
<i>to anybody else,</i>

579
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,701
<i>but to us, they're worth a ton.</i>

580
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,704
And we wouldn't have found that stuff,

581
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,372
um...

582
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,708
if we didn't start this process.

583
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,047
[upbeat music playing]

584
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,137
-[Wendy] Did you dust these?
-[tap running]

585
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,596
[Ron] Yeah, more or less, but...

586
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,808
Don't-- you know, you're gonna create
more work than you want

587
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:47,851
if you start doing that.

588
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,728
-[doorbell chiming]
-[Ron]There's the door.

589
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,062
Um...

590
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,738
-<i>Konnichiwa!</i>
-Hi! <i>Konnichiwa!</i>

591
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,198
-How are you?
-Hello. Hi.

592
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,951
[Ron] I think we're gonna show you
the garage first.

593
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,287
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] Oh, great idea.

594
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,332
-Wendy-san!
-Marie!

595
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,667
-How are you?
-Good.

596
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,793
[Wendy] Good to see you.

597
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,503
[speaking Japanese]

598
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:19,299
-This is a completely different room.
-[Wendy] Yes, even from last week, right?

599
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,176
[Marie speaking Japanese]

600
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,344
-[Iida] <i>You did this all in a week?</i>
-[Wendy] <i>Yeah, yes.</i>

601
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,471
[Iida] <i>Amazing!</i>

602
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,182
[Ron] Those are some dolls
I found in a box.

603
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,392
-[Wendy] How do you say "doll"?
-[Marie] <i>Kokeshi.</i>

604
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,727
[Iida] <i>Kokeshi</i> dolls.

605
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:34,147
Morioka, Sendai, Mizusawa, the reindeer.

606
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,941
-[speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] Look at all the tiny ones!

607
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,443
-They're so cute.
-Aren't they cute?

608
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,069
We had no idea these existed.

609
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,280
It was hidden in one of the cabinets.

610
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,199
[speaking Japanese]

611
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,868
[Iida] It brings me joy
just to see this in the garage,

612
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,412
that you have space to display this now.

613
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,955
All through this process,

614
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,458
I was stepping back, going,
"How did we let it get to this?"

615
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:56,044
<i>Or "How did this happen?"</i>
<i>Or "How did that happen?"</i>

616
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,129
<i>And, man, I can't leave anything</i>
<i>around anymore.</i>

617
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,840
I mean it's like, "Why's that
in the middle of the living room?"

618
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,425
"Why is that there? Why is that there?"

619
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:06,846
So it's definitely changing us
and I have to say it's for the better.

620
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,019
[Wendy] <i>Here's my office!</i>

621
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,521
[Marie squealing]

622
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,940
-Can you believe it? Look at this.
-Wendy-san!

623
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:20,652
So, see? We did it. [laughing]

624
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:27,158
[Wendy] <i>And then here's workspace here,</i>
<i>workspace there.</i>

625
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,452
<i>Ron and I, we thought, "You know what?</i>

626
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,205
<i>this would be a good place</i>
<i>to store the photo boxes."</i>

627
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,419
-[Iida] <i>What happened to all the shoes?</i>
-[Marie] <i>Ah!</i>

628
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,463
[Wendy]
<i>Oh, I'll show you. We moved everything.</i>

629
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:46,678
Alright, so here, now we have more of
the clothing all in the Mount Wendy room.

630
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,180
[Marie speaking Japanese]

631
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,682
[Iida] <i>I know, little by little,</i>

632
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,976
<i>this is turning into being</i>
<i>a walk-in closet.</i>

633
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:59,649
-Okay, so here is Ron's space.
-[Marie] Ah.

634
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:00,984
[Wendy] <i>Workspace.</i>

635
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,320
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] <i>I love it.</i>

636
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:14,289
[Wendy] <i>This is all that's left</i>
<i>after the big mountain.</i>

637
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,957
[Wendy laughing]

638
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:19,752
The whole KonMari philosophy
and everything, I think, really has

639
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,505
played a key into the way
that we're looking at stuff.

640
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,133
[speaking Japanese]

641
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,176
[Iida] Yeah, I think this is
a very good volume

642
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,345
-that you can calmly look through.
-Yes.

643
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,473
[Ron] <i>There's a value to our possessions</i>

644
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,768
<i>that maybe I didn't feel</i>
<i>that I had before.</i>

645
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,354
So if I have, um...

646
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,817
ten baseball cards as opposed
to 1,000 baseball cards,

647
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:47,322
I'm gonna treasure those ten
baseball cards more than if I had 1,000.

648
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,866
That's really huge coming from him
because, really,

649
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:54,370
for him to cross over,
you know, into the light

650
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,539
is huge, it's huge.

651
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,167
Okay, yeah, so, I just want to say that.

652
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,507
[Marie speaking Japanese]

653
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,260
[Iida] <i>Ah, look how clean this room is.</i>

654
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,851
[Wendy] <i>And so here's a picture.</i>

655
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,771
If you stand right here, this is the view.

656
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,565
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] How many years ago was this?

657
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,026
[Wendy]
<i>This is probably a good 20 years ago.</i>

658
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,945
-[Iida translating]
-[Marie speaking Japanese]

659
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:27,862
[Wendy] <i>Yeah.</i>

660
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,075
[Marie speaking Japanese]

661
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,577
Really, just everything
that has been placed here,

662
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,580
it's just transformed the feeling
in this whole room.

663
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,458
-It's so different.
-Oh, thank you. Yeah, we feel it, too.

664
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:45,046
I can feel a change in the atmosphere
of the house.

665
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:48,591
<i>It feels lighter, it feels more positive.</i>

666
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:54,347
And actually, to me, is probably
the first step in de-stressing

667
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,225
and moving forward, you know,
into our retirement years.

668
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,479
[in Japanese] I'm just struggling
to find the right words

669
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,898
because I'm so moved right now.

670
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:07,777
Because these past six weeks,

671
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,698
both of you have so seriously confronted

672
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:16,202
not just your possessions, but your
own lives and yourselves as well,

673
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,079
and I'm just so moved.

674
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,873
That's what I'm, you know,
most proud about her.

675
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,291
She's a good partner.

676
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,044
We did put in some long hours some days.

677
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,630
[speaking Japanese]

678
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,842
[Iida] So on our very first day together,
I asked,

679
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:33,720
"What is our ideal vision
for your life together"?

680
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,389
And, Ron, you mentioned
"happy wife, happy life."

681
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,057
Do you think you've accomplished that?

682
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,935
Yeah, I think we accomplished
happy wife, happy life.

683
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,270
[laughing]

684
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,565
She's my girl, she's always been my girl,
she'll always be my girl.

685
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,942
There were times where
it was a little hard...

686
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,903
and, um, we came through it.

687
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:51,988
Here we go, guys.

688
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,990
First game of pool,

689
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,491
in I don't know how many years.

690
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:59,996
He partnered with me on this
and, you know, went all in.

691
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,166
And that is, you know, really something.

692
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,169
You know, thanks.
I was really, really thankful for that.

693
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:11,049
[Wendy] Oh, my God. I do not believe that!

694
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:14,469
This really has been
a fun thing for us to do.

695
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,219
We've laughed a lot.

696
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,056
He's sandbagging me! [laughing]

697
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:20,266
<i>I think that both of us,</i>

698
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,768
we have gotten closer and it's brought
a lot of joy in my life.

699
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:25,313
[Wendy] Oh, my gosh,
these flowers are beautiful!

700
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,438
Look at those.

701
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,982
<i>And now we're thinking</i>

702
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:32,737
there really isn't any other task
that we couldn't do together.

703
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:36,032
[speaking Japanese]

704
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:40,620
[Iida] Congratulations for successfully
completing the KonMari Method of tidying.

705
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:41,913
You've graduated!

706
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,206
We graduated! Yay! Oh, my gosh!

707
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,835
I'm very, very happy
with the results and...

708
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:53,966
um, I can honestly say that it's gonna
change the way I view possessions,

709
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,092
it's gonna change the way--

710
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,929
Actually, the way that I, you know,
proceed with the rest of my life.

711
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,100
-Ditto.

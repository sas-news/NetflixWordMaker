00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,924
-Ah!
-[woman] She looks excited!

2
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:11,052
I'm so excited because I love mess.

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:14,347
[man] It's a never ending battle
to fight the clutter.

4
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,349
-[knocking]
-Oh!

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,019
I want things to be more simple.
I don't know how to fix it.

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,438
With the baby coming,
it's gonna be more chaos.

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,314
-[clattering]
-[gasping, squealing]

8
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,567
[man] Oh, my God! We have too much stuff!

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,028
Hello, I'm Marie Kondo.

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,279
[in Japanese] My mission

11
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,741
is to spark joy in the world
through cleaning.

12
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:33,950
Ching!

13
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,995
[narrator] <i>Best-selling author</i>
<i>and world-renowned tidying expert</i>

14
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:41,583
<i>Marie Kondo is dedicated to inspiring</i>
<i>the world to choose joy</i>

15
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,334
<i>with the KonMari Method.</i>

16
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,253
[in Japanese]
A feature of the KonMari Method

17
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:48,256
<i>is that you clean by item</i>
<i>and not by location.</i>

18
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:51,718
And we will always clean using
the same categories.

19
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,386
[in English] First, is clothing.

20
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,096
-[Marie grunting]
-[laughter]

21
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,264
I can't reach.

22
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,849
Next, is books.

23
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,852
[Iida] Giving them a little shake
and wake them up.

24
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,479
Then, paper.

25
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,438
[man sighs] I can't do the papers.

26
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,690
[deep groan]

27
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,027
The largest category is <i>komono.</i>

28
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,614
<i>Komono </i>is kitchen, bathroom,

29
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,740
and garage.

30
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,868
Everything miscellaneous.

31
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,163
Finally, sentimental items.

32
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,999
It's kinda hard to let it go,
'cause I really like this one.

33
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,212
[sniffling] This is kinda hard.

34
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:30,131
I don't want to just, you know, dump it.

35
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,093
But I want to be thoughtful about it.

36
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,554
[man 2] <i>From the moment she</i>
<i>set foot in our house,</i>

37
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,473
<i>she had this presence to her.</i>

38
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,767
She wants to see this place turned around.

39
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,895
Marie brought a whole bunch
of joy upon our home.

40
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,313
This is amazing.

41
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,440
[girl] You're so cute! I love you!

42
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,734
You're so cute.
 I love you, too. [laughing]

43
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,028
These are, like, happy, happy tears.

44
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,197
Thank you for what you've brought
to our home, really.

45
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,165
[woman] <i>Hello.</i>

46
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,542
[man] <i>What's up, babe?</i>

47
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,086
-Come here. What's up?
-Okay.

48
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:09,461
-Nothing.
-How are you?

49
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,090
I'm wet now
'cause it's raining a lot outside.

50
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,591
-Was it raining?
-Yes.

51
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,135
[dog barking]

52
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,803
[man] She's home.

53
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:17,762
[woman] Gus!

54
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,431
-Gus?
-It's okay, I'm watching them.

55
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,766
-There you go.
-Where you going?

56
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,227
Come here, baba. Over here. Okay.

57
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,854
-It's okay.
-It's like I'm not even here.

58
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,606
I'm Clarissa. This is Mario.

59
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,983
I'm Mario. We've been...

60
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:33,069
together now for going on six years now.

61
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,613
You know, the first time I saw him,
I was like, "Oh!"

62
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,575
-And I was just kinda smitten.
-How was it?

63
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,285
[laughing]

64
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,953
[Clarissa]
This is the trip when we, like,

65
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,539
officially became
boyfriend and girlfriend, went to Cabo.

66
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,540
<i>It started off slow.</i>

67
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,625
I was always here, staying the night.

68
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,128
<i>You know, we just always hung out.</i>

69
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,214
[Mario] <i>Immediately, when I first met her,</i>
<i>I was just captivated by her eyes,</i>

70
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,759
<i>she has beautiful eyes,</i>
<i>and her smile is what won me over.</i>

71
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,887
Immediately, I knew
there was something there.

72
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,763
[Clarissa] <i>I love his personality.</i>

73
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,934
<i>He's always, you know, trying to make</i>
<i>the best out of a situation.</i>

74
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,729
<i>So I just-- I love everything about him.</i>

75
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,564
And he's not bad to look at either.

76
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,024
[laughing]

77
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:14,277
He used one of my eyeliners to write
"Will you be my girlfriend?"

78
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,321
on the mirror. [laughing]

79
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,948
<i>-With a check box "yes" or "no".</i>
-[woman] <i>Did you say yes?</i>

80
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,534
Of course I said yes.<i> </i>[laughing]

81
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,536
-We've been hanging out ever since.
-Yeah.

82
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,998
God we, uh... I don't know
what I'd do without this girl.

83
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,375
We complement each other so well

84
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,169
in anything and everything that we do.

85
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,712
So we have each other's back.

86
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,589
Through and through.

87
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,972
[in Japanese]
Tidying is not just about cleaning.

88
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:47,227
It is also about creating a space
that sparks joy.

89
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,397
By doing this, you get
one step closer to your ideal life.

90
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,235
I will be visiting the house
of Mario and Clarissa.

91
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:59,656
Their biggest challenge is to be able
to let go of their items from the past

92
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,909
and to create a tidy home
for their future.

93
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,411
I'm looking forward to helping
Mario and Clarissa

94
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,372
as they set out on their new journey.

95
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,249
[Clarissa] Yeah, so...

96
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:10,625
Yeah...

97
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,085
It's getting real.

98
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,045
[Mario] Look at the other picture.

99
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,130
-His flexing?
-Yeah.

100
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,839
[both laughing]

101
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,259
This is your kid.

102
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:20,885
That's a little dude!

103
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,553
[laughing]

104
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:26,599
We are expecting a little one
in about six months.

105
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,726
-[chuckling]
-We're expecting our firstborn.

106
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,811
It's a boy.

107
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,980
Uh, and we are stoked.

108
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,066
[Mario] <i>We are so eager to be parents.</i>

109
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,778
<i>Going to, you know, see the sonograms</i>
<i>or to hear the heartbeat...</i>

110
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,029
<i>It melts you.</i>

111
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,157
With the baby coming,
we gotta get our stuff in order,

112
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,244
-otherwise it's gonna be more chaos.
-Yeah.

113
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,081
[Mario] <i>This is ultimately where</i>
<i>I wanna see my kids grow,</i>

114
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,584
<i>but we are slightly overwhelmed</i>
<i>with the amount of stuff</i>

115
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,336
<i>that we keep in certain rooms.</i>

116
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,171
<i>That's where the problem begins.</i>

117
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,507
[Clarissa] <i>We've just accumulated</i>
<i>all of our extra stuff:</i>

118
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,969
<i>clothing, shoes,</i>
<i>just whatever you can think of.</i>

119
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,972
<i>Storage bins full of things</i>
<i>that don't get run through.</i>

120
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,516
<i>We need to get rid of it, move it,</i>

121
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,810
because we do need to make room now.

122
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,563
It's not a matter
of we want to clean up this room

123
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,024
'cause it'd be nicer that way,
now it's like we have to.

124
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:20,695
I would like to have the house
as complete as possible

125
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:24,574
and still have some time
before the baby gets here.

126
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,994
I don't want my water to break
in the middle of us painting or something.

127
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:28,953
[laughing]

128
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,205
Well, Mario painting,
'cause I won't be painting.

129
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,332
[laughing]

130
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,666
It's time.

131
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,879
We're gonna have to part ways
with a lot of things we don't want to.

132
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,213
Yeah.

133
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,883
-But it's all for the better.
-Yeah.

134
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,344
All for the better of our guests,

135
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:48,014
our family, our friends, and the baby.

136
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,391
[triumphant pop music playing]

137
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,071
[birds chirping]

138
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,867
[Marie speaking Japanese]

139
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,665
[in Japanese] Oh, this is it?

140
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,837
[door buzzer sounding]

141
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,422
-Oh.
-Moment of truth.

142
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,216
-Here we go.
-[chuckling]

143
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,634
Oh, Lord, here we are.

144
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,931
-Hi! Hello!
-Hello. Welcome!

145
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,391
Nice to meet you. I'm Marie.

146
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,226
-Nice to meet you.
-Miss Marie, Mario.

147
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,937
Nice to meet you, Miss Marie.
Welcome to our home.

148
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,064
-Thank you for inviting me.
-[Clarissa] No, thank you.

149
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,400
We're excited
that you're coming to help us.

150
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:44,570
Yes, I'm so excited
about tidying this house.

151
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,655
We're excited, too.

152
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,490
-A little nervous, but excited.
-Yes.

153
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,493
-Don't worry. Have fun.
-[laughing]

154
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,703
Okay. It'll be fun.

155
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,248
-Good, good. We can't wait to get started.
-Yeah.

156
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,376
So this is one of the areas, for example,

157
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,254
that we've put it together,
and eliminated some of the clutter out.

158
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,506
[speaking Japanese]

159
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,592
So, I'm just so excited
to see all the other rooms.

160
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,970
-Are you ready? Okay, let's do this.
-[Clarissa laughing]

161
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,222
[Mario] This is our kitchen.

162
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:15,518
[Clarissa] So, I mean, trying to keep it
as organized as we can, but...

163
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,061
[speaking Japanese]

164
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,605
-[Iida] So do both of you cook?
-[Clarissa and Mario] Yes.

165
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,691
Yes, we do. I specialize in breakfast.

166
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,318
She kinda handles the other two meals.
[chuckling]

167
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,696
-[Mario] Trouble drawers.
-[Clarissa] Just junk.

168
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,198
[Mario] So, this is receipts...

169
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,118
Oh, you can't even open it
because she's stuffed her gum in there.

170
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,787
[Clarissa] We could get rid
of a lot of the stuff that's in here.

171
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,330
[speaking Japanese]

172
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,041
Yes, I agree. I think this place
will change very dramatically.

173
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,795
Oh, man! I can't wait. [laughing]
I can't wait.

174
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,631
The next space that I guess needs help,

175
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,592
-the office.
-[Marie] Ah.

176
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,718
[Clarissa] Um...

177
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,137
Over time,
things have just gotten stored in there.

178
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,390
I hold onto things and throw 'em here,
just so they're out of the way.

179
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,476
[speaking Japanese]

180
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,646
[Iida] So, are there any spaces that you
use as an office besides this one spot?

181
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,731
-No.
-No.

182
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,942
Because we do most of our--
our tablets and our laptops,

183
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,487
we take with us wherever we go,
into every room.

184
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,615
So doesn't serve us really any purpose.

185
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:15,203
One thing that we're considering is
it possibly being a nursery,

186
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,747
because we are expecting our first child.

187
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,706
Oh!

188
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,042
-So....
-Oh, you have child?

189
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,044
-We're carrying it right now.
-Congratulations!

190
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,712
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

191
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,547
[speaking Japanese]

192
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,967
[Iida] I think this is an excellent
opportunity for you to tidy,

193
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,677
because my clients have told me

194
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,429
that they're so glad that
they got it over with before the baby.

195
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,557
-[Clarissa] Oh, yeah.
-[in English] Because of time.

196
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,058
-Of course.
-Yes.

197
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,394
I can understand,
because I have two babies.

198
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:41,854
-[Mario] Oh, yeah?
-Yeah!

199
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,565
[in Japanese] You should expect
to have a lot more things.

200
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,317
[laughing]

201
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:52,073
[in Japanese] When your first child
is born, your world changes completely.

202
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:55,493
So you get to imagine
what kind of parents you want to be,

203
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,371
or how you want to live as a family.

204
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:02,833
This is the excitement
that parents get to experience

205
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:07,421
as they tidy for their first child.

206
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:11,342
<i>For me, what changed</i>
<i>after my daughters were born,</i>

207
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:16,347
<i>was that no matter how much I tidied,</i>
<i>my daughters would pull things out.</i>

208
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,558
<i>So keeping a tidy house</i>

209
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,018
became very difficult.

210
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,854
[Clarissa] Okay, so we'll go ahead
and go upstairs.

211
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,569
-[Clarissa] Up here is two bedrooms.
-[Marie] Yeah.

212
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,029
[Clarissa] We both have
a lot of shoes, so...

213
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,115
-[Iida translating]
-[Marie] Oh!

214
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,867
-So should we have shoe racks?
-Yeah.

215
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,744
Call it the clutter room.

216
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,831
-I like it. Yeah, he's so cool.
-[Mario] He's cool, right?

217
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,291
That's what I saw!

218
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,043
[Clarissa] This we use as a guest bedroom.

219
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,255
-These are Mario's shoes. So...
-Ah!

220
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,423
[Mario] Yes.

221
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,507
[Clarissa laughing]

222
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,592
[Mario] That's me.

223
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:57,513
I've been collecting sneakers now
for over 25 years.

224
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,182
[in Japanese] Oh, 25 years!

225
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:05,563
And it was a lot worse.
Now it's only about 150, 160.

226
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,024
[laughing]

227
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:13,863
[Mario] I've been collecting sneakers
since I was 12 years old.

228
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,032
-Put 'em down on the floor, look at 'em?
-Yeah.

229
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,367
[Iida] That way you really know
what you have.

230
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,787
[Mario] <i>I loved sneakers, I loved sports,</i>
<i>I loved athletes.</i>

231
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,497
<i>These are the people I looked up to,</i>

232
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,625
<i>and it sounded so far-fetched</i>
<i>for me back then,</i>

233
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,627
<i>but I think when I became an adult, and...</i>

234
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,380
as I started having an income,
that was a priority,

235
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:36,552
and I started just kinda buying,
and it got maybe a little out of control.

236
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:41,891
<i>Ninety-five percent of them</i>
<i>were never used, never unlaced,</i>

237
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,768
<i>let alone ever tried on.</i>

238
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,812
<i>So, more than anything,</i>
<i>I'm ready to get started.</i>

239
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,232
[Marie speaking Japanese]

240
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,403
So first, really look
 at all the shoes that you own.

241
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,072
Everything.

242
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,874
Alright, we got some work.

243
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,461
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] You'll be able to do it, trust me.

244
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,963
-[Mario] We trust you.
-[Marie] Yes.

245
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,173
Alright.

246
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,174
Let's go.

247
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,467
[laughing]

248
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,765
[speaking Japanese]

249
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,893
[Iida] So, tidying will begin now.

250
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:26,811
-Yes.
-Okay.

251
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,939
[in English] Before starting,
I would like to greet your house.

252
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,315
-[Mario] Okay.
-[Clarissa] Okay.

253
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,363
Greeting house is very important for me.

254
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,864
[Mario] Okay, good.

255
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,116
Thank you.

256
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,119
[peaceful music playing]

257
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,651
[peaceful music continues]

258
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,366
-[speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] Thanks.

259
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,035
-[speaking Japanese]
-Thank you so much for giving me the time.

260
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,203
-Sure.
-No problem.

261
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,788
[speaking Japanese]

262
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,582
-Okay, so let's begin tidying.
-Okay.

263
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:32,918
Oh, my. Let's go. Ready. [laughing]

264
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,255
-What's first?
-[in English] The first step is clothing.

265
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,132
-Clothing, ooh.
-Okay.

266
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,719
Put them into a pile.

267
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:42,928
Okay.

268
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,430
-Okay.
-Down here.

269
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,682
-[Mario] Here?
-Here. All of your clothes.

270
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,100
-Everything?
-All the clothes?

271
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,226
[Marie] All the clothes.

272
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,228
-[Mario, nervously] Okay.
-[laughing]

273
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,606
Oh, my-- That's a lot of clothes, Marie.

274
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,149
-[Marie] I know.
-Yes?

275
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,609
-Yeah.
-Okay.

276
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,611
-[Iida] We begin now.
-Alright.

277
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,030
Okay, let's go.

278
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,281
[Mario] Oh, God.

279
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,327
-Can you take that off, babe?
-[Marie] Yeah.

280
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,620
[Marie struggles, laughs]

281
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,871
I can't reach.

282
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,039
-Yeah.
-Babe, help!

283
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,708
I'm trying, I'm trying. [laughing]

284
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,460
[Marie] I need your help, of course.

285
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,836
[Mario] Oh, God.

286
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,342
[Iida] So this will be
Clarissa's mountain.

287
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,677
[Clarissa laughing] This isn't even..

288
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,556
close to all of it.
'Cause we want everything.

289
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,308
-Like, drawers too?
-[Marie] Yes.

290
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,935
-Wow.
-[Iida] Yes, drawers, everything.

291
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,770
[Mario] This is gonna get in tomorrow.

292
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,855
-[Clarissa laughing]
-[Iida speaking Japanese]

293
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,273
-[Mario] Oh, my.
-[Clarissa] Okay.

294
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,734
-I see a unicorn outfit. What is that?
-It's a onesie.

295
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,320
It's a onesie? That I've never seen?

296
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,490
-This'll be a lot of homework.
-[Clarissa sighs]

297
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,825
[Mario] Dang it.

298
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,454
-This girl is no joke.
-This is giving me anxiety.

299
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,206
-Deep breaths.
-[Clarissa laughing]

300
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,501
-Alright, you still...
-It's still not as bad as--

301
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,753
Are you kidding?

302
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,924
[peaceful music playing]

303
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,301
[Clarissa sighs]

304
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,139
This mess... [laughing]

305
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,558
...makes me...

306
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:15,479
it's kinda like I need to--
Everything needs to be out of here.

307
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,857
[laughing]

308
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,820
-[Mario] Yeah, this is a lot.
-Yeah.

309
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,530
Yeah.

310
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:29,118
But this is so important,
to see everything you have.

311
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,953
-See it, right it?
-[Marie] See, yeah.

312
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,205
I knew we had a lot. I didn't...

313
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,791
envision this.

314
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,917
-Yeah.
-[Iida translating]

315
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,169
When you see clothes laid out,

316
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,547
displayed entirely, this is my life.

317
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,883
-[Iida translating]
-[speaking Japanese]

318
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:47,177
[Iida] So from here on out,
you will be selecting things

319
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,638
that sparks joy for you.

320
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:50,931
Okay.

321
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,392
-[Marie, in English] Spark joy.
-Spark joy.

322
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,936
[Mario] So this is...

323
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,730
Yes.

324
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,398
Yes.

325
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,276
-Yes.
-[Clarissa] Alright.

326
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,360
[Mario] Yes.

327
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,195
Yes.

328
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,488
Yes.

329
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,324
Yes. Keep.

330
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,701
[Clarissa] <i>He has a lot of clothes, and...</i>

331
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,162
<i>I think a lot of the stuff</i>
<i>going into the love,</i>

332
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,496
<i>love...</i>

333
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,626
love, and I'm like,
where's the stuff you're getting rid of?

334
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,627
[chuckling]

335
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,836
No.

336
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,464
No.

337
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,842
-No.
-Goodbye, sir.

338
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,636
[Marie] And this is goodbye?

339
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,679
-Not yet.
-Not yet? Alright.

340
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,973
I'm still yes, no. Like...

341
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,602
Touch it. I don't know,
I might need it this summer.

342
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,771
This is hard. This is sentimental.

343
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,814
[speaking Japanese]

344
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,525
[Iida] What I recommend when that happens
is to start with something

345
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,861
that's really easy to make
a quick decision.

346
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,862
[Mario] There you go.

347
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,574
Oh, yeah, this is not fun. Right now.

348
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,576
But I know, I get it.

349
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,827
-No.
-That's a no?

350
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,912
I'm saying goodbye.

351
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,664
-Thank you.
-Reluctantly, that's a no?

352
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,581
Yeah.

353
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:06,882
[in Japanese] Many people may feel guilty
when letting go of items.

354
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,511
<i>By expressing gratitude toward</i>
<i>the items you let go,</i>

355
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,305
<i>it will lessen the feeling of guilt.</i>

356
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,224
Thank you very much.

357
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,477
For example, it's important to express

358
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,314
gratitude toward clothes you never wore.

359
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:27,403
This is because the shirt taught you

360
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:31,198
that you do not like
to wear shirts like this.

361
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:35,577
By doing this, it will become clear

362
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,997
what is necessary for you.

363
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,666
[speaking Japanese]

364
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,377
[Iida]
So, I think it's going pretty smoothly,

365
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,256
so I was thinking of assigning
all the rest for homework.

366
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,216
Okay, so we're done here, right?

367
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,136
-[Iida translates]
-[Mario] That's it, right? [laughing]

368
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,973
I'm realizing a lot of these clothes
I haven't touched in years.

369
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,182
Okay.

370
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,102
[Mario] <i>I have a lot of stuff, man,</i>
<i>and I don't let go of things,</i>

371
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,646
<i>so it's gonna be hard.</i>
<i>It's gonna be rough.</i>

372
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,482
-Less clutter and more homework, right?
-[Clarissa laughing]

373
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,901
-Alright, thank you.
-Okay, thank you. Bye.

374
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:09,361
-Have a good night. Bye.
-Bye, guys.

375
00:17:09,444 --> 00:17:10,695
-[Marie] Bye.
-[Clarissa] Bye.

376
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,828
[Clarissa] No.

377
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,290
That's still a lot of shoes.

378
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,876
No.

379
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,089
No.

380
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,051
[Clarissa] <i>Starting to feel good</i>
<i>about the process,</i>

381
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,928
<i>starting to really get rid</i>
<i>of a lot of stuff.</i>

382
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,098
Things that I haven't used,
whether it be clothing, shoes,

383
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:42,686
you know, some purses
I'm fine with getting rid of, and just...

384
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,022
<i>creating more space. So, I'm not...</i>

385
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,483
someone that's gonna
hold onto something that...

386
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,694
I haven't used in years
just because I want to keep it.

387
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,612
<i>But...</i>

388
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,781
<i>I don't know if that's happened for Mario.</i>

389
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:57,117
I'm interested to see
how quickly he's willing to actually

390
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,577
get rid of something.

391
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:00,913
[deep sigh]

392
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,291
<i>Because he's definitely got much more</i>
<i>of an emotional attachment to things.</i>

393
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,168
-[barking]
-[Mario] Come on.

394
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,252
Come on, I'm sorting.

395
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,546
You guys come here,
I'm not gonna be able to do anything.

396
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,423
Oh.

397
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,009
Yeah, this one I don't know
if I can part ways with.

398
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:14,927
This one means a lot.

399
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,847
'Cause despite whatever struggles

400
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,183
or financial burdens my parents
were going through,

401
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,977
I think actually my Dad might have been
unemployed that Christmas.

402
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,065
And nonetheless,
I remember he took us to go buy.

403
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:32,069
These were real sacrifices
that my parents were going through,

404
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,907
to sometimes just put a smile on our--
me and my brother's face.

405
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,702
I've kept things
just because I do appreciate

406
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,246
what my family has done.

407
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,541
My first Guatemala soccer jersey.

408
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,794
[Mario] <i>So, it's not as easy</i>

409
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,089
<i>as I thought it was gonna be</i>
<i>to let go of some of this stuff.</i>

410
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,423
[deep sigh]

411
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,842
Yeah. [sniffles]

412
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:58,220
<i>But, uh, I guess you just sit back</i>
<i>and trust the process.</i>

413
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,305
Granted, I haven't got to my shoes yet,

414
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,015
which I think is gonna be
the hardest part.

415
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,393
But I think that, uh...

416
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,146
I'll take my time with that,
I will say that.

417
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,190
But no, that's staying. That's-- Yeah.

418
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,074
-[dog barking]
-[Marie] Oh!

419
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,076
[Marie speaking Japanese]

420
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,327
Hello.

421
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,580
-[Marie and Iida] Hello.
-[Mario chuckling]

422
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,583
-[Mario] Hi. How are you?
-Hi. Good.

423
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,751
-How are you?
-How's it going? Nice to see you.

424
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,378
-Nice to see you. Hi.
-Hi!

425
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,172
Hi. Good to see you again.

426
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,424
-[Marie speaks Japanese]
-[Iida] How are you guys doing?

427
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,217
<i>-[Mario] </i>We're good.
<i>-[Clarissa] </i>Good.

428
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,468
[speaking Japanese]

429
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,387
-I'd love to see the closets first.
-Okay.

430
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,015
-If that's okay.
-[Clarissa] Closets, alright.

431
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,226
Mine. And then his is over...

432
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,520
-Wow.
-[Clarissa laughing]

433
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,522
[speaking Japanese]

434
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,609
[Iida] How did you feel sorting through
your clothes and making selections?

435
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:57,279
I feel good. It was nice to get rid
of things that I don't use anymore

436
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,157
and things that I know
that I'm not going to use, so...

437
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,783
[speaking Japanese]

438
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,411
How about the clothes that you folded?
May I see those?

439
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,329
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

440
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,706
Okay, so there is my dresser.

441
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,667
So all of this pretty much took up
this whole drawer.

442
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,127
[Marie speaking Japanese]

443
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,923
-[Iida] You are so great at folding!
-[laughing]

444
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,508
-Thank you.
-[Iida] I'm surprised. I'm stunned.

445
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,594
[speaking Japanese]

446
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,597
-The socks, I can recommend another way.
-[Clarissa] Okay.

447
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:24,973
[Mario] Ooh.

448
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,518
-[speaking Japanese]
-So just stack them together like this.

449
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:29,895
[in English] Fold in half.

450
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:30,854
-Oh, okay.
-You see?

451
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,773
And then that way you can stack them all.

452
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,901
And also the band won't stretch out. Yeah.

453
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,862
Yeah, I throw away a lot of socks
'cause that happens.

454
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,697
-[laughing]
-[Iida translating]

455
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,366
Okay, babe, it's your turn.

456
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,700
[Clarissa laughing]

457
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,285
-[Mario] Please.
-Thank you.

458
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,997
-Oh! [speaking Japanese]
-[Clarissa laughing]

459
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,251
-Yes, the same method, I think too.
-[Mario] Socks, I've done the same here.

460
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,254
I have socks, bigger socks obviously.

461
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,840
How would you fold that technique
that you were telling Clarissa

462
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,550
with something like this?

463
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,636
[Marie speaking Japanese]

464
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,974
[Iida] For socks of this length,
I would recommend folding it in thirds.

465
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:07,891
[Mario] Okay.

466
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,768
[Iida] For thicker materials like this...

467
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,103
-[Mario] Okay.
-...thirds work.

468
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,604
[Mario] And just file it as well.

469
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,897
Okay.

470
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,691
[Marie speaking Japanese]

471
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,068
[Iida] I think you guys are on
a very, very good pace.

472
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,488
But what's important is that you guys
are motivated to transform your lives.

473
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,740
-[Mario] We are.
-[Iida] That's what matters the most.

474
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,200
[Marie speaking Japanese]

475
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,329
So after clothes,
the next category is books,

476
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,707
right after that is paper documents.

477
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:39,965
[in Japanese] Tidying together
is a great way for couples

478
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:43,176
to see if they share the same values.

479
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,097
From here, I'd like for them to learn
the importance of working together.

480
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,600
[speaking Japanese]

481
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,419
[Clarissa] <i>Okay, so I'm gonna start</i>
<i>moving the papers.</i>

482
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,838
[Mario] Just realized, babe,
this is all your stuff.

483
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,215
-[Clarissa laughing]
-This ain't none of mine.

484
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,260
[Clarissa] The black stuff is yours.
-[Mario] Yeah, that little container.

485
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,554
Oh, jeez. [chuckles]

486
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,474
I hold on to note books.

487
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:31,933
I'm just like you.

488
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,268
I have stickers.

489
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,561
Why?

490
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,230
My prom... invitation.

491
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,442
-You got stuff I think you can--
-[Mario] That I'm keeping.

492
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,568
Shred.

493
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,362
[paper shuffling]

494
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,488
Shred.

495
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,741
One thing for me I think
which was so easy for me to kind of...

496
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,160
get rid of things is,

497
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:53,372
<i>if I'm looking at it and it's not</i>
<i>something I like or not something that</i>

498
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,832
<i>strikes anything in me,</i>
<i>I'm fine with getting rid of it.</i>

499
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,377
An unopened invitation
to my brother's wedding.

500
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,796
I'm keeping that one.

501
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,465
These are from all our holiday parties.

502
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,050
These are keep.

503
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,676
[Clarissa] <i>Argh!</i>

504
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,721
<i>But I don't know</i>
<i>if Mario's fully there yet.</i>

505
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,140
<i>He's still not getting rid of things.</i>

506
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,893
What's this little pile I see here, hmm?

507
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:17,020
Oh, this is just some...

508
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:21,024
stuff that needs to kinda find a place
here in the house still.

509
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,068
<i>It's a little frustrating just because</i>

510
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:26,279
we have a set timeline
where we're gonna be expecting a baby

511
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,782
in, what, five months?

512
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,076
<i>I'm worried because, even though</i>

513
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:34,663
<i>it's five months away,</i>
<i>like, the days seem slow.</i>

514
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,832
But then all of a sudden, like,
a month goes by

515
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,333
and I'm like, "How did that happen?"

516
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,334
Okay.

517
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,129
I'm working on it, babe.
I'm working on laying on this couch.

518
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,047
Probably shouldn't be
in the living room, but...

519
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:44,965
[Mario groans]

520
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:49,261
I definitely hope that Marie really helps
get him in line

521
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:53,223
with what needs to be done,
because I could tell him

522
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,143
ten times to move something
or put it away,

523
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,353
and he's gonna do it when he wants to.

524
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,564
You still have homework to do.

525
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,527
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] <i>Just you today?</i>

526
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,446
-[Mario] <i>Yes, just me today.</i>
-[Iida] <i>Yes? Okay.</i>

527
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,738
[speaking Japanese]

528
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,825
[Iida] I think your next assignment
is gonna be miscellaneous items.

529
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:12,742
Okay.

530
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,703
[in English] Maybe garage.

531
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,288
That'd be great. Yes, I'd love to.

532
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,294
-[Iida] Excuse me.
-[Mario] Alright.

533
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,588
[in Japanese]
The garage seems to be a little neater.

534
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,465
-Wow, very clean.
-We picked up a little bit.

535
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,757
[Mario] Yeah.

536
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,302
Um, our doggies are out here
hanging out for now.

537
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,470
[Iida translating]

538
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,013
[Marie speaking Japanese]

539
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,639
-[Iida] Mario, I was wondering.
-Yes?

540
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,267
[Iida] Is there anything in here
that you would let go?

541
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,145
[Mario] Most of the stuff here
still has function.

542
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,397
Like, I have a lot of tile...

543
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,316
-[Iida translating]
-...stored away here.

544
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,943
These are essential electrical supplies

545
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,488
that we're gonna need
once we redo this room,

546
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:53,074
so, uh, there is a purpose
for all this stuff eventually.

547
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,703
[Marie, in Japanese]
Okay, let's just take everything out.

548
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:57,621
Okay.

549
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:02,083
[Iida] Anything you want to keep,
try to keep them in separate categories.

550
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,752
-[Mario] Separate categories? Okay.
-Yeah.

551
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,463
-Uh, and for the doggies.
-[in English] Ah, doggy. Okay.

552
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,051
And this is a vintage clock
that someone gave to me.

553
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:14,679
This is the alarm clock
that woke me up every day for high school

554
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,723
and I loved it so much.

555
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,976
I'm just that kinda dude
that attaches emotion to things, you know?

556
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,188
[Mario] <i>I might be</i>
<i>what some people call sentimental.</i>

557
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,273
<i>And I guess over the course of time,</i>

558
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,068
I've found it really hard
to part ways with some of this stuff.

559
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,737
<i>As scary as it is for me to admit,</i>

560
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,074
<i>I definitely need just an intervention.</i>

561
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,284
Now, here's a good question for you,

562
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,954
because this does have some type
of sentimental value.

563
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:39,871
[Marie] Ah.

564
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,082
Because this was the mailbox

565
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,794
that was originally on the home
when I purchased it.

566
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,713
So how do you feel
about something like this?

567
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,048
[speaking Japanese]

568
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,300
[Iida] So, when you hold this
in your hand,

569
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,052
does it still spark joy for you?

570
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,555
[peaceful music playing]

571
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,227
I guess joy wouldn't be
the right word to identify this

572
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,187
as to what it means to me, because...

573
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,191
it's just a reminder of, hey...

574
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,069
You know? For what it's worth,
I never thought that,

575
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,697
you know, to have my parents come
from Guatemala,

576
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,575
and where they came from,
to be here in America now,

577
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:19,244
and have their home and, you know,

578
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:23,081
have their son have his home
three doors down from them

579
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,500
is something that I think no way

580
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:29,129
could they have ever fathomed
or even thought of ever happening.

581
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:33,049
So, that's why I guess little things
like this mean something to me.

582
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,135
[speaking Japanese]

583
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,220
[Iida] But this is something
that you'd like to keep

584
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,097
as part of your life going forward?

585
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,436
When you put it that way...

586
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:45,729
no.

587
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,148
I can comfortably say that

588
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,775
the mailbox I have outside

589
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:54,279
is more joy than what this is, because...

590
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,699
it's something that we did together.

591
00:26:58,825 --> 00:26:59,826
I can let it go.

592
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,204
[in Japanese] Thank you.

593
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,459
[Mario] <i>Through the Kondo process,</i>
<i>yes, it's changing me as we speak</i>

594
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,461
<i>and it's starting to make sense.</i>

595
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,796
<i>It's time to let go of some of this stuff.</i>

596
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:16,134
I don't know who the Mario's gonna be
after this process, but...

597
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,137
it's uncharted territory,
and I'm really

598
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,598
kinda anxious to see where it ends.

599
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,184
I mean, I was anxious to get here.

600
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,644
So now that we're here,

601
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:29,272
I feel like now I'm gonna go through this
as much and as hard as possible.

602
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:32,108
So next time you're here,
maybe it looks different.

603
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,027
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

604
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,612
<i>-Gracias.</i>
<i>-Gracias.</i>

605
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,322
[laughing]

606
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,913
[Clarissa] And Mario right now
is going through paperwork.

607
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,706
-Huh, babe?
-Yeah.

608
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,502
-Let the shredding commence.
-Let the shredding commence.

609
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,880
<i>The wheels are in motion,</i>
<i>and I'm just seeing...</i>

610
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,592
seeing and looking at things completely
from a different perspective.

611
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,469
I'm really second guessing everything

612
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:02,097
as to why it's here,
why we're keeping things.

613
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,140
I'll keep.

614
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,143
That's it?

615
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:11,773
[Mario]
We have a lot more real estate here.

616
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,067
-[Clarissa] So here we go.
-Trash.

617
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:18,905
Mario's about to dump
a whole bunch of stuff in the trash.

618
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,616
[Clarissa] <i>I think Mario's mindset</i>
<i>has definitely changed.</i>

619
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,202
<i>It was a bit hard at first for him</i>
<i>to get rid of things,</i>

620
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,287
<i>but he's much better than before.</i>

621
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,415
And Mario's much...

622
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:31,918
much more eager to get things done
right then and there.

623
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:36,798
[Clarissa] So, I've gone ahead
and emptied all of the drawers here.

624
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:40,051
And got through everything in the kitchen.

625
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,137
And I'm excited, it looks...

626
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,306
completely different than
what it looked like before.

627
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,810
[Mario] <i>I'm more surprised about how Clari</i>
<i>has come along in this whole process.</i>

628
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,772
<i>There's this driving force behind her</i>
<i>and I can't help but to feed off of her.</i>

629
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,400
<i>I got a pregnant girl</i>
<i>that's doing the work here.</i>

630
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,861
The last thing I want her to do
is feel stressed,

631
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,571
especially going through this pregnancy.

632
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:02,240
I want her to be confident
knowing that I have her back

633
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,993
and I'm supportive with anything
and everything that she might need.

634
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,494
There's our little guy.

635
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,205
Twelve weeks. He's much bigger now.

636
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,000
Teeny tiny.
He's as big as a dollar bill today.

637
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,711
[Mario] <i>Obviously we're transitioning</i>
<i>into parenthood</i>

638
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:17,714
<i>and to have this kind of approach</i>
<i>of tidying things up</i>

639
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:21,092
ultimately be part
of our everyday kinda habits,

640
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:25,013
that's kind of the life I wanna lead,
you know, when my son gets here.

641
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,858
Oh, man. [sighing]

642
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:40,987
[sighing]

643
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,952
Before the whole process even started,

644
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,080
I knew, I was kinda hesitant to, you know,

645
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:55,210
get started with what was gonna be
addressing my shoe situation.

646
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:56,920
Oh, man.

647
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,464
Because those are the ones
that are dear to me,

648
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,217
that obviously has
more sentiment behind...

649
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,345
um, each and every one
of those pairs of shoes.

650
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,847
<i>But I think I'm finally ready.</i>

651
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:10,225
<i>It's time to part ways</i>
<i>and de-clutter some of these shoes.</i>

652
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,143
The first pair.

653
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,856
You'll stay here.

654
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,199
[Mario] <i>$10,000 worth of credit card debt.</i>

655
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,785
<i>I remember that was the first time</i>
<i>I realized I had a problem.</i>

656
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,703
Debt to tennis shoes.

657
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:35,041
No, that's not what I want my little man
to think is...

658
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,835
what life is, nah.

659
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,755
<i>I don't ever want him</i>
<i>to glorify anything materialistic.</i>

660
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,092
[groaning]

661
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,763
That hurts.

662
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,391
Never got to wear you guys.

663
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,476
[sentimental music playing]

664
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,477
Well...

665
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,983
<i>Some of these shoes have been with me...</i>

666
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,735
<i>God, over three decades.</i>

667
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:07,198
<i>These are like childhood sneakers</i>
<i>that I might have preserved because...</i>

668
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,826
<i>even though they weren't my size</i>
<i>as an adult,</i>

669
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,203
<i>I still kept them just</i>
<i>for the sake of what they were</i>

670
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,914
<i>when I first was introduced to them</i>
<i>or laid my eyes on them.</i>

671
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,500
Almost the same exact shoe.

672
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,002
But...

673
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:22,046
now into my adulthood
and let alone transitioning

674
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,507
into the next chapter of my life,
which is fatherhood,

675
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:28,011
I realize that certain things have kind
of served their purpose with me,

676
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:31,222
<i>and I guess maybe that's more</i>
<i>of an invitation now, metaphorically,</i>

677
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,140
<i>to what's to come,</i>

678
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,184
and just open to receiving
whatever it is that comes my way,

679
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,645
that I'm kind of detaching myself from...

680
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,814
what was that kinda like...

681
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,774
that mindset
that I had when I was younger.

682
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,111
Hello.

683
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,112
[Mario] What's up?

684
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,322
[Clarissa gasping]

685
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,865
What are you doing?

686
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,158
Trying.

687
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,784
[chuckling]

688
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,705
Looking at things differently.

689
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,543
[Clarissa] Do we have a...

690
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,255
a, uh, give away or...

691
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,090
-Yeah, those.
-...don't keep? These?

692
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:10,261
So, you're giving away all the shoes
that I've actually seen you wear.

693
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,556
Yeah, because I intend to wear
the ones that I love now.

694
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:20,313
[Clarissa] <i>I'm definitely proud of Mario</i>
<i>because he's finally willing</i>

695
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:23,274
<i>to part with shoes that he has held onto.</i>

696
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,611
And the amount
that he has chosen to get rid of,

697
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,238
to me, was surprising because I didn't--

698
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,865
I'd never seen that before,

699
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:34,452
so I certainly didn't expect him
to get rid of as much as he did.

700
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,622
So that was-- that was surprising to me.

701
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,792
This has never happened
with this pair of shoes.

702
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,460
-Do they fit?
-Yes.

703
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,212
-[laughing]
-Like a glove.

704
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,009
-You bought those, what, four years ago?
-Yeah.

705
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,722
And if that doesn't tell you something.
I've never even put 'em on.

706
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,100
[Mario] It feels good.

707
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,394
[sighing]

708
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,484
[in Japanese]
There are many people like Mario

709
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:10,822
who want to display their shoes.

710
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:15,034
[speaking Japanese]

711
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:38,016
This arrangement creates
an aesthetic balance to the shoe rack.

712
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,903
[Marie and Iida speaking Japanese]

713
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,455
[door buzzer sounding]

714
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,998
[Mario] Hello, hello.

715
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,542
-Ah, hello!
-[Clarissa] Hi.

716
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:05,710
Hi!

717
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,504
-[Clarissa] How are you?
-[in Japanese] How are you doing?

718
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,755
I'm doing really well.

719
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,632
-Good, good.
-[Marie gasps]

720
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,302
-The house is yours for you to...
-[Iida translating]

721
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,304
...run through it and see what you think.

722
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,804
And please, we're always ears

723
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,766
to anything that you're gonna
counsel us to do.

724
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,936
[Marie, in Japanese]
I'm most interested in the rooms upstairs.

725
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,904
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-[Clarissa and Mario laughing]

726
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,739
-[Iida] Phenomenal. Wow.
-[Clarissa] Yeah.

727
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:36,741
<i>I think I took the most from this process,</i>

728
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,618
just because I, uh...

729
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,036
I did have a lot of stuff.

730
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,623
<i>Where I started,</i>
<i>I was over 160 pairs of sneakers,</i>

731
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,293
<i>and that's now chipped away</i>
<i>to probably, like, below 45.</i>

732
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,128
<i>It feels good.</i>

733
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,547
I have an appreciation now
for the things that I did keep

734
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:56,636
and, most importantly,
it made things easy to part with.

735
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,224
[in Japanese]
Wow, this area changed so much!

736
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,518
[Mario] <i>And so I don't ever see myself</i>
<i>going back to</i>

737
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,187
<i>the way I was before</i>
<i>Marie came into our lives.</i>

738
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,356
[Clarissa] <i>Just the techniques</i>
<i>we've learned, you know,</i>

739
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,607
<i>folding the clothes,</i>

740
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,110
I think it's just gonna make it
a lot easier for us

741
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,154
to continue to keep the house,
you know, clean and in order.

742
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,491
<i>The kitchen is probably</i>
<i>the biggest change.</i>

743
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,122
<i>I'm really happy that</i>
<i>the kitchen looks the way it does now.</i>

744
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,128
<i>The counter tops are as,</i>
<i>you know, empty as they can be.</i>

745
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,631
<i>The cabinets are organized.</i>

746
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,174
[Marie speaking Japanese]

747
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:38,386
-[Iida] <i>You've worked so hard, you guys!</i>
-[Clarissa] <i>Thank you!</i>

748
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,847
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] <i>Oh, Clarissa.</i>

749
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,850
Okay.

750
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,353
[Marie gasping]

751
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,230
-[Clarissa laughing]
-[Marie speaking Japanese]

752
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,481
[Iida] <i>Wow!</i>

753
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,067
[Marie speaking Japanese]

754
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,528
[Iida] <i>Yes, I think this</i>
<i>is remarkably done.</i>

755
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:56,571
[Mario] <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

756
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,489
<i>I love walking in here now.</i>

757
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,450
<i>I literally have come here</i>
<i>just to grab a chair,</i>

758
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,369
<i>sit on my phone,</i>
<i>and just hang out in here.</i>

759
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,580
[Iida] <i>So I just want</i>
<i>to commend you, Mario,</i>

760
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,832
<i>because how I remember</i>
<i>this garage was</i>

761
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,293
<i>on the first day, to this dramatic change?</i>

762
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,795
-[Mario] <i>It was bad.</i>
-[Iida] <i>This is very impressive.</i>

763
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,755
[speaking Japanese]

764
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,383
-[Iida] Great job on the garage.
-Thank you. Thank you.

765
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,885
[Clarissa] He passed, right?

766
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,011
[speaking Japanese]

767
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,722
-He more than passed. Very good.
-[Mario] With flying colors.

768
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,849
I can't believe how much progress
we've made from

769
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,893
what the house looked like to, you know,

770
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,562
<i>once Marie got here,</i>
<i>to what we've been able to do now.</i>

771
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,981
So I'm just completely surprised,

772
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,108
had no idea it would
end up looking like this.

773
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,360
Alright.

774
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,447
[speaking Japanese]

775
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,532
[Iida] I can clearly see
that you guys both

776
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,243
worked so hard in the tidying process.

777
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,788
It was a bit stressful
'cause it was just so much at once,

778
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:52,376
um, but I'm very happy
with the end result.

779
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,756
[Mario] I feel like 95% of everything
is where it needs to be,

780
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,759
so I don't feel as overwhelmed
with the amount of work

781
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:02,595
that we need to do
to ultimately, like, clean.

782
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,890
[Clarissa] <i>The office area since that's...</i>

783
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,976
<i>looking like it's gonna be</i>
<i>the final spot for the nursery.</i>

784
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,230
<i>It's, I mean, obviously not ready</i>
<i>for us to do that yet.</i>

785
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,566
<i>The desk is in there, there is stuff</i>
<i>that just needs to not be in there,</i>

786
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,193
<i>but it's very close.</i>

787
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,570
[speaking Japanese]

788
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,949
[Iida] But I think now,
you said you're 95% there,

789
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,493
but the road to 100%,
I think it's very clear.

790
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,287
-[Clarissa] Yeah.
-I have every faith that you can finish.

791
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:31,624
[Mario] <i>I know that along this process</i>
<i>we've gotten stronger.</i>

792
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:34,126
I am so eager and so motivated,

793
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,212
now more than ever, to just...

794
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,506
plow through as much as I possibly can

795
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,550
in terms of addressing things
and projects around the home.

796
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:46,138
Just to see it just coming to fruition,
it's just, it's so--

797
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,683
Such a good feeling
and I'm hooked on that feeling right now.

798
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,686
-We'll be done before the baby's here.
-Yes.

799
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,604
And much before the baby gets here

800
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,232
because we do wanna enjoy
this free time that we now have.

801
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,025
[speaking Japanese]

802
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,988
[Iida] So, is it okay if I ask
when the baby is due?

803
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:05,157
In August. So do you wanna go grab
the new pictures?

804
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,994
[Mario] Would you like to see him?
Yes, I'll get 'em.

805
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,621
[Marie speaking Japanese]

806
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,124
[Iida] This is a great timing
that you finished this.

807
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,959
[Clarissa]
Yeah, that's what we're thinking.

808
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,336
That's why, you know,
we're kind of putting...

809
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,965
deadlines on all the other things
we wanna get done to just...

810
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,925
-Please.
-...enjoy.

811
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,262
Here, let's put 'em down there.

812
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,431
-[speaking Japanese]
-Put 'em on the table.

813
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,224
[in Japanese] I can see the face!
[squealing]

814
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,227
-[laughing]
-[in Japanese] Oh, my gosh! It's a person!

816
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,440
-[Iida] Oh, there he is.
-[Clarissa] So, yeah, he is a boy.

818
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,527
[in English] Oh, I can see.

[all laughing]

820
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,657

What an amazing thing to look forward to.

821
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,243
-[in Japanese] Thank you.
-[Iida] Thank you so much. I'm honored.

822
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,329

-<i>Gracias.</i>

836
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,360
through this tidying process.

837
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:25,029
Even though they are still
not completely finished,

838
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:28,115
I'm sure by the time their son arrives,
their home will be ready.

839
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,494
I hope Mario, Clarissa, and their son

840
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,662
will continue to spark
a lot of joy in their future.

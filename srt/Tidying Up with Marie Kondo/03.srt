1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,924
-Ah!
-[woman] She looks excited!

2
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:11,052
I'm so excited because I love mess.

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:14,347
[man] It's a never ending battle
to fight the clutter.

4
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,349
-[knocking]
-Oh!

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,019
I want things to be more simple.
I don't know how to fix it.

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,438
With the baby coming,
it's gonna be more chaos.

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,314
[gasping, squealing]

8
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,567
[man] Oh, my God! We have too much stuff!

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,028
Hello, I'm Marie Kondo.

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:32,741
[in Japanese] My mission is to spark joy
in the world through cleaning.

11
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:33,950
<i>Ching!</i>

12
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,995
[narrator] <i>Best-selling author</i>
<i>and world-renowned tidying expert</i>

13
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:41,583
<i>Marie Kondo is dedicated to inspiring</i>
<i>the world to choose joy</i>

14
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,334
<i>with the KonMari Method.</i>

15
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,253
[in Japanese]
A feature of the KonMari Method

16
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:48,214
is that you clean by item
and not by location.

17
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,718
And we will always clean using
the same categories.

18
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,386
[in English] First, is clothing.

19
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,096
-[Marie grunting]
-[laughter]

20
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,264
I can't reach.

21
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,849
Next, is books.

22
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,852
[Iida] Giving them a little shake
and wake them up.

23
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,479
Then, paper.

24
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,438
[man sighs] I can't do the papers.

25
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,690
[deep groan]

26
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,027
The largest category is <i>komono.</i>

27
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,614
<i>Komono </i>is kitchen, bathroom,

28
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,740
and garage.

29
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,868
Everything miscellaneous.

30
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,163
Finally, sentimental items.

31
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,999
It's kinda hard to let it go,
because I really like this one.

32
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,212
[sniffling] This is kinda hard.

33
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:30,131
I don't want to just, you know, dump it.

34
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,093
But I wanna be thoughtful about it.

35
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,554
[man 2] <i>From the moment she set foot</i>
<i>in our house,</i>

36
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,473
<i>she had this presence to her.</i>

37
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,767
She wants to see this place turned around.

38
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,895
Marie brought a whole bunch
of joy upon our home.

39
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,313
This is amazing.

40
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,440
[girl] You're so cute! I love you!

41
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,734
You're so cute I love you, too. [laughing]

42
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,028
These are, like, happy, happy tears.

43
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,197
Thank you for what you've brought
to our home, really.

44
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,872
[woman] <i>One, two, three. Jail!</i>

45
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,999
-[boy] Goodbye.
-[laughing]

46
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,002
-One two, three, four, five six...
-Did you just say my name in vain?

47
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,963
...eight, nine, ten, eleven.

48
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:11,047
No!

49
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,590
[squealing] No!

50
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,176
-I'll cost you 3... 440.
-Four-forty.

51
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,139
We are the Mersiers.
Our nickname is The Fantastic Four.

52
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,056
Indeed.

53
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,726
And our son created that nickname
because all of us are outgoing,

54
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,020
-[Douglas] Mm-hmm.
-all of us are extremely silly...

55
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:26,938
[Douglas chuckles]

56
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:30,567
...and we're artsy as a family.
We-- We just go for it.

57
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,570
Whatever we're feeling, we just kinda do.

58
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:37,198
What do you guys think about making sure
that we can hit the park...

59
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,908
-Yes.
-...before it gets too dark?

60
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,577
Does everybody have clothes for the park?

61
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,204
-Do you know where they are?
-No. You know where they all are.

62
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,748
You know what I did?
I went into my dressers,

63
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,334
I took everything out to put it back in.

64
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,628
To find one pair of pants.

65
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,089
-I cannot find matching socks.
-[Katrina] Okay.

66
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:57,051
Well, freeze the game, 'cause I don't want
anybody getting extra money.

67
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,970
[Douglas] Do not mess up my board

68
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,097
'cause you know I'm about
to come back and win after--

69
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,642
No, I'm the one who's about to win!
[laughs]

70
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,270
Moving from Michigan, we had to downsize

71
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,148
coming from a four-story,
four-bedroom house,

72
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:13,610
now reduced down
to a two-bedroom apartment.

73
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,403
[Katrina]
Do you know where your pants are?

74
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,281
-Yeah, I just got some out.
-[Douglas] But I need shorts.

75
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,451
-You only have one pair of shorts?
-I have, like, three!

76
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,455
[Katrina] <i>In L.A. I'm starting</i>
<i>a new adventure with my entire family.</i>

77
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,541
<i>We wanna take advantage</i>
<i>of the opportunities here.</i>

78
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,502
<i>Back in Michigan, it could be</i>
<i>sometimes one note.</i>

79
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,755
-If you're a hair stylist...
-Mm-hmm.

80
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,673
...that work is limited in Michigan.

81
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,176
If you are someone in music,

82
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,387
-the jobs are limited.
-Indeed.

83
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,806
-Did you find your black shorts?
-Um...

84
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,059
We're gonna miss the sunlight
if we can't find 'em.

85
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,477
-[Douglas laughs]
-Real talk.

86
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,480
[Kayci] Mom, do you know
where my matching jacket is?

87
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,733
[Katrina] We've been living here
for a year and a half now.

88
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,527
And I must say...

89
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,155
it hasn't felt like home.

90
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,075
[Douglas] <i>I mean, we're doing</i>
<i>the best we can because,</i>

91
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,078
<i>you know, it's a smaller space</i>
<i>than what we're used to.</i>

92
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,289
<i>But we feel stressed at home</i>
<i>because of the clutter.</i>

93
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,209
[Katrina] <i>It's an unnecessary pressure</i>
<i>and stress for them</i>

94
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,962
<i>to live tight like this.</i>

95
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,423
<i>It's just this one big cycle of...</i>

96
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:20,260
<i>jumbled scatterbrain.</i>

97
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,178
<i>That's a big red flag.</i>

98
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,097
<i>I don't want to live like that.</i>

99
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,307
So, I need help.

100
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,142
[Douglas] We need help.

101
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,648
[in Japanese] When my family and I moved
from Japan to the United States,

102
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:40,154
we only brought things
that truly sparked joy for us.

103
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,032
For the Mersier family,

104
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:47,662
their new challenge is to downsize
the things that they own,

105
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,747
so it will fit in their new home.

106
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,420
[upbeat instrumental music]

107
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,343
[Marie, in Japanese] It's so cute!

108
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,970
Oh, wow!

109
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:08,391
The look of American apartments
is so cute.

110
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,810
Maybe it's the color.

111
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,566
Hello.

112
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,027
-Hi! Hello!
-Hi, come on in!

113
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,154
-Hi!
-[Marie] Nice to meet you!

114
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,114
-Nice to meet you.
-I am Marie.

115
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,367
-Nice to meet you. Douglas.
-Iida. Nice to meet you.

116
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,870
-Katrina. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

117
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,872
-Goodness, it's so good to see you.
-Welcome.

118
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:31,831
[Marie] Thank you!

119
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,207
[speaking Japanese]

120
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,585
I see a lot
of musical instruments already.

121
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,253
-Do you play--
-[Douglas] I'm a musician.

122
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,922
-[Marie] Oh.
-[Douglas] I play upright, the guitar.

123
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,674
-[Kayci] I play my voice.
-Oh, really?

124
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,301
She's a sing-- She's our singer.

125
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,510
-Wow. Great.
-Yeah.

126
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,554
[speaking Japanese]

127
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,973
So your whole family is in one band or...?

128
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,016
[laughing]

129
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,601
We look like it, huh?

130
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,979
No, I'm not in a band.
I'm the hairstylist and I dress them all.

131
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,105
-[Katrina] Wardrobe.
-Wow.

132
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,941
-She makes sure we eat, you know?
-Yeah.

133
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,026
[laughing]

134
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,656
-Let's start in…
-Yeah. We can go around. All this is...

135
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,158
-...the living room.
-Yeah.

136
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,410
-This is our multipurpose room.
-Yeah yeah yeah.

137
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,370
[Douglas] Mm-hmm.

138
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,122
-This is where we eat...
-Yeah yeah yeah.

139
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,042
...we also watch movies,
and we have a huge DVD collection.

140
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,461
[Marie, in Japanese]
Oh. Is this for your music?

141
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,379
Yeah.

142
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,006
[Katrina chuckles]

143
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,801
-So cool!
-Yeah. It's cool.

144
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,760
So cool.

145
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:30,556
-This is our tight, tight kitchen.
-Yeah.

146
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,350
[Douglas] It's my favorite room
not to be in.

147
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,559
[Katrina] Ay-ay-ay.

148
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,520
-This is what frustrates me, is...
-[Marie] Yes.

149
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:39,440
...I will come to get a glass, and it's
like all of the seasoning are in there.

150
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,276
And it just looks cluttered to me,
and it just... I stay out.

151
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,113
-[Marie and Iida speak Japanese]
-[Douglas] And Dad doesn't cook at all.

152
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,531
[speaking Japanese]

153
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:47,782
[Iida] Did you use to cook?

154
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,578
No. I had one accident
trying to make oatmeal, and I was like...

155
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,624
-[in Japanese] Not since then.
-I order a mean carry out though.

156
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,084
[laughing]

157
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,794
[Douglas] Go into the bedroom.

158
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,588
The bedroom. So he takes this dresser

159
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,675
and I just try to put my life
in these six.

160
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,261
-Your underwear...
-Underwear, socks...

161
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,138
-and swimsuit stuff.
-Yeah yeah yeah.

162
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,222
[Marie speaking Japanese]

163
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,974
[Iida] Are you aware
of where everything is?

164
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,851
-[Katrina] Yes.
-She's the only one

165
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,103
-that's aware of everything.
-[Iida tarnslating]

166
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,480
We-- We ask her,

167
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,149
"Look for a special shirt,"

168
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,109
I'll say "Where is it?"
and she'll tell us.

169
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,026
Ah.

170
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,820
[speaking Japanese]

171
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,906
[Iida] I'm sure it's a lot
when you get asked all the time, right?

172
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,199
Oh, my.

173
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,286
And they don't like my mood
because sometimes I'm like...

174
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,581
[Douglas] <i>Katrina bears</i>
<i>a lot of the weight</i>

175
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,250
<i>of keeping the house organized,</i>

176
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,753
<i>and helping us to keep it organized,</i>
<i>because we don't know where things are.</i>

177
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,840
It's the real daily struggle.
I'll be home alone,

178
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,428
and I'll just say,
"Dang, where is this? I need this now."

179
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,515
And I say,
"Mm, texting Mom. Gotta text Mom."

180
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,392
And it will be to a certain point

181
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,978
where I just spam her phone
until she answers.

182
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,897
That's how much I depend on her.

183
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,940
[Katrina] Have you ever seen such a thing?

184
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,066
[Marie] Every day.

185
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,568
[laughing]

186
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,111
-I love a mess.
-Do you?

187
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,362
-Yes.
-Yeah.

188
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,739
-Oh!
-You know what?

189
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,949
-This is so exciting for me.
-[Katrina] Is it?

190
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,784
-Oh, I'm so glad. I'm so glad.
-Yeah.

191
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,955
[Katrina]
I'll let the kids show you their room.

192
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,624
-[Marie] Oh...
-So!

193
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,709
Okay, let's open these up

194
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,504
to show you how embarrassing
our clothes are up there.

195
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,589
-[Nolan] Terrible.
-Oh, not tall enough.

196
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,633
-[Marie straining]
-I got it.

197
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,593
Oh! Hey!

198
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,010
I'm here for that.

199
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,261
He's good!

200
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,972
[Marie] It's Kayci's and it's Nolan's?

201
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,225
-[Katrina] Yeah.
-[Douglas].

202
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,184
The funny thing with this shelf,

203
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,604
so I bought it and I said,
"You take two shelves,

204
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:43,313
he takes two shelves,

205
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,691
and this can be
what you guys use during the day.

206
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,028
Keep it neat."
But they can't find anything.

207
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,615
[Douglas] So they'll pull everything down,
it'll be all over...

208
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,908
[Iida translating]

209
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,535
-Wow.
-[Katrina] Yeah.

210
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,786
[speaking Japanese]

211
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,162
[Iida] I think it would be best

212
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,706
if they have a dresser of their own,
too, eventually.

213
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,874
Yes.

214
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,211
The other half of the room,
it is also cluttered.

215
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,712
There's no space.

216
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:10,258
It's hard for me to feel
like this an actual home.

217
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,802
[somber instrumental music playing]

218
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,849
So they have so much in the room,

219
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,352
because when I organize it,

220
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,647
they don't keep it organized.

221
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,817
It's okay Mom. It's 'cause--
-[Katrina] 'Cause I keep trying.

222
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,360
[Douglas] You're trying hard, I know.

223
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,737
Yeah, like, she organizes our things,

224
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,823
but we don't know how
to keep them organized,

225
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,910
so then when we mess it up
it just hurts her, and it hurts me too,

226
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,871
'cause I feel bad
after I mess it up, so...

227
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,415
[Katrina] <i>I feel like I'm to blame</i>

228
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,626
<i>'cause I'm the mom and Mom is supposed</i>
<i>to create the memories.</i>

229
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,753
<i>Mom is supposed to make home home.</i>

230
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,007
<i>I hold that near and dear and I own it.</i>

231
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,467
<i>It's my responsibility to do the laundry,</i>

232
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,512
<i>go to the grocery store,</i>
<i>wash dishes, cook,</i>

233
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,556
<i>and I've got to clean the kids' room.</i>

234
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,850
But I feel like I'm failing in that area.

235
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,145
Which is not okay with me.

236
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,938
I want to...

237
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,232
create a home
that they will remember, you know?

238
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,611
I want them to remember
where they had peace of mind

239
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,362
and they had a lot of love

240
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,907
-and that's where their support came from.
-Mm-hmm.

241
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,909
-As they were growing up.
-Indeed.

242
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,202
-Sorry.
-We have to help, Mom.

243
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,912
Let's keep showing her the other rooms.

244
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,748
-Yeah. It's okay.
-Mama!

245
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,916
-I'm okay.
-Mama, Mama, Mama.

246
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,376
-I'm okay.
-Mama, Mama!

247
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,794
[in Japanese] It'll be okay.

248
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:33,966
It seems like Katrina
manages all the family's belongings.

249
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,427
However,

250
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,512
through the KonMari Method of tidying,

251
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,724
I would like to teach the family

252
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,727
how to be responsible
with their belongings.

253
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,313
[Marie speaking Japanese]

254
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,149
[Iida, translating] So, we're gonna begin
the tidying process from here,

255
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,652
but there's something that I like to do
before we begin.

256
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,279
I always like to introduce myself
to the house.

257
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,280
Wow.

258
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,663
[peaceful music playing]

259
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,704
-[speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] Okay, great.

260
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,039
[speaking Japanese, laughing]

261
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,458
-[Iida] This is a very nice home.
-[Douglas] Thank you.

262
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,379
-[speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] So, the first step is clothes.

263
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,214
-Okay.
-Alright. Let's do that.

264
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,674
[Katrina laughs]

265
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,012
[Marie speaking Japanese]

266
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:05,516
[Iida] First, let's begin
with making a big pile

267
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,601
of all the clothes that you own.

268
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,520
-[Nolan] Snuggy!
-[laughing]

269
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,604
Oh, my--

270
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,022
-Ugh.
-[Marie chuckles]

271
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,066
-[Douglas] You got a lot of clothes.
-Actually...

272
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,651
[Kayci] Yeah, he has way more than me.

273
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,238
[Douglas] No. You always are like,
"I don't have anything to wear."

274
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,948
[Nolan]
That's 'cause they're always dirty.

275
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,117
-[Douglas] All his stuff is out.
-[Nolan] We did it!

276
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,201
[Douglas] Woof!

277
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,870
[Douglas laughing]

278
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,580
[Marie speaking Japanese]

279
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,083
[Iida]
How do you feel looking at your piles?

280
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,628
[sentimental music playing]

281
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,426
Seeing that much for her,

282
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,513
I'm definitely not setting her up
to win at life.

283
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,349
He's 12, she's 11.

284
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,478
We could have started this at age five,
just like you.

285
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,147
-[speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] Not too late, never too late.

286
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,523
-Mm-hmm.
-That's it.

287
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,358
[speaking Japanese]

288
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:00,070
[Iida] So from here, we'll be selecting
the clothes that you want to keep

289
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,489
and what you want to let go.

290
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,909
Only keep clothes that sparks joy for you.

291
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,036
-Yes.
-Clothes that you've decided to let go,

292
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,705
thank it for all
that it's been doing for you.

293
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:10,873
-Gratitude.
-Yeah.

294
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,958
-Gratitude is very important.
-[Kayci] Yeah.

295
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,085
[Nolan] Done so much good for me.

296
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,504
I thank you for that.

297
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,549
You know,
your girl isn't gonna get rid of you.

298
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,384
How have I not worn you before?

299
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,887
You give me so much joy. Oh, my goodness!

300
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,597
[speaking Japanese]

301
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,516
[Iida]
For kids, you guys don't have drawers,

302
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,643
so I have something to recommend to you.

303
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,228
-[Douglas] Alright.
-[Katrina] Okay.

304
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,605
[peaceful music playing]

305
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,316
[speaking Japanese]

306
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,069
[Iida] We're gonna create storage
out of these shoe boxes,

307
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,487
but it's only temporary for now.

308
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,197
[Marie speaking Japanese]

309
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,368
[Iida] In an empty box,
stack them vertically like this.

310
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,161
-[Douglas] Oh.
-[Iida] There we go.

311
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,163
-[Nolan] Wow.
-[Douglas] That's unbelievable.

312
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,456
[Marie speaking Japanese]

313
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,917
[Iida] So, you had put clothing racks
in your room, right?

314
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,835
[Douglas] Yes.

315
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,838
-[Iida] You can put the box in there.
-[Nolan] Oh, that's amazing.

316
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,924
[Iida] So then you can go ahead
and buy a dresser or...

317
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,385
you know, you'll know exactly
how much space you need.

318
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,555
With Marie coming to help us,
this is the opportunity

319
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,849
for me to learn how to organize

320
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,643
and to downsize, so that I can finally

321
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,312
make this place a home.

322
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,564
-Bye.
-[Douglas] I'll get that.

323
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,232
-Bye.
-We'll miss you. 'Til the next time.

324
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,192
-[Marie] Yeah.
-[Katrina laughing]

325
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,778
Oh, my gosh.

326
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,738
That was amazing!

327
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,991
-Can she come back, please?
-[Kayci] She blew my mind.

328
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,576
-I know, right?
-[Douglas] My goodness.

329
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,077
Let's get busy with the homework.

330
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,370
Right. We have to--

331
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,290
If you don't get your homework done,
you won't be able to sleep.

332
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,500
-Think about it.
-You'd better finish.

333
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,668
[Douglas laughing]

334
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,300
[Kayci] <i>Are these my goggles?</i>

335
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,259
[Nolan blubbers]

336
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,219
[Kayci humming]

337
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,096
[Nolan] Get out. Swim.

338
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,016
[Katrina]
It sounds like you guys are playing.

339
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,685
Come on now, do the right thing in there.

340
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,105
[Nolan] Oh, gosh, why did I do this
to these shoes, too?

341
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,315
[Kayci] What'd you do?

342
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,984
-This.
-[Kayci] Bro!

343
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,237
Oh, no. But those are such good shoes.

344
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,572
The first Jordans.

345
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,574
[Nolan] No!

346
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,200
[Katrina] How's it coming? Are you done?

347
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,744
-[Nolan] Almost.
-This is my problem.

348
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,621
-[Kayci] You can't--
-[Katrina] Finish.

349
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,956
You owe it to yourselves to finish.

350
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,667
Y'all don't wanna do this tonight, do you?

351
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,585
[Nolan] Nope.

352
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,588
[Katrina]
<i>I get frustrated from the clutter.</i>

353
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,715
I would like for home
to feel like home for them

354
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,343
and I feel like it starts with me. I do.

355
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,262
<i>So I've ended up with doing</i>
<i>their homework for them.</i>

356
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,348
<i>Being a mom is demanding.</i>

357
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,100
<i>I feel accountable for...</i>

358
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,145
<i>downsizing, how things are organized,</i>

359
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:41,440
<i>so everyone's like,</i>
<i>"Mom, where did you put my this?</i>

360
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,150
<i>Mom, where did you put my that?"</i>

361
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,736
And they know,
I like being able to say "It's here"

362
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,697
because I know
that in their mind it's jumbled,

363
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,991
and I know that the one thing I want
is peace of mind.

364
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,159
I want to give that to them.

365
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,579
<i>But it bothers me slightly</i>
<i>that they come to me...</i>

366
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,123
<i>wondering where is everything.</i>

367
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,541
<i>It's overwhelming.</i>

368
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,170
<i>So I want-- I want them to get that.</i>

369
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,849
[Marie, in Japanese]
We look like we're best friends.

370
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,811
[knocking]

371
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,650
-Marie, hi!
-Hi!

372
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,734
Iida, hi!

373
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,404
-Nice to see you.
-Good to see you.

374
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,905
Welcome, welcome.

375
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,366
I couldn't wait to see you today.

376
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,701
[Iida translating]

377
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,868
[Katrina laughing]

378
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,286
[Marie speaking Japanese]

379
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,915
-It's raining so hard today.
-I know. I wish I could control it.

380
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,042
[Marie speaking Japanese]

381
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,045
[Iida]
Today's theme is miscellaneous items.

382
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,801
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-I'll pull it.

383
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,636
[Iida] This category
of miscellaneous items,

384
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,640
there's a lot of different sub-categories
within this big category.

385
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,226
The trick is to start with something
that's easy for you.

386
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,646
You know, I can actually put this here,
so we can see what we have.

387
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,316
-[Iida] So bed linens for Kayci?
-[Katrina] Yes.

388
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,403
But I wasn't quite sure
if I was folding them properly.

389
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,488
[Marie speaking Japanese]

390
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:14,616
[Iida] As long as you're folding it
upright like this, you've got it.

391
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:23,625
[in Japanese] Folding fitted sheets...

392
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:28,172
seem to trouble many people.

393
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,841
Fitted sheets contain...

394
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:37,389
rubber bands inside, so you cannot fold...

395
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,518
the edges together.

396
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,980
But don't worry,

397
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,815
take the sides towards...

398
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,277
the center,

399
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,782
creating a rectangle.

400
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,744
Whichever way you choose

401
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,330
to fold the sheets,

402
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,124
when storing in drawers,

403
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,293
if you store them standing upright,

404
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,421
they will look neat.

405
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:15,052
So, I kinda wanna set
the family up to win,

406
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,722
so I need your advice on that,
'cause you leave your family, right?

407
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:22,810
Do they maintain the way you have the home
organized and everything?

408
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,478
[speaking Japanese]

409
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:28,565
[Iida] Yes, as a family, each person has
a room that they're responsible for.

410
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,319
-But laundry, that's my forte--
-Right.

411
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,781
-I'm sure that's accumulating as we speak.
-Yes. Oh, my goodness, yes.

412
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:36,782
[speaking Japanese]

413
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,118
[Iida] So I was wondering,
when I first met you,

414
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:43,580
I noticed that a lot of the cleaning
and tidying fell to you.

415
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,125
Do you think through this process
that'll change?

416
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,710
I think they'll be more proactive

417
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:53,757
because they now have some clue
of where their things are.

418
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,759
And instead of me doing it,

419
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,345
I think,
now I'll be able to just guide 'em,

420
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,972
and not just me doing it.

421
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,431
[speaking Japanese]

422
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,892
[Iida] You know, you're living together,

423
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,020
so it's important for everyone
to maintain their space

424
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,399
and their belongings, but not only that,
but to help each other as well.

425
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,401
[Katrina] <i>Before Marie came,</i>

426
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,320
<i>I wasn't setting</i>
<i>my own self up to win as a mom.</i>

427
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,030
<i>I was doing too much.</i>

428
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,159
Instead of being a homemaker,
I'm a make-it-work-maker.

429
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,495
Do what you gotta do to make it work,
be strong, be tough.

430
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,915
And that love is just
dwindling down because

431
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,001
no one person can do it all.

432
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,794
<i>So, Marie's right.</i>

433
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,964
<i>We all need to work together, as a family.</i>

434
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,967
-I like the idea of assigning everyone.
-[Marie] Yeah.

435
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,720
It gives them a job
that they're responsible for.

436
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:43,098
But I'm nervous about
the organization of it,

437
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:47,019
because they sort it
and I helped with the organizing, so...

438
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,145
[speaking Japanese]

439
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,980
[Iida] It's perfectly understandable

440
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,107
for you to help and create
their storage spaces,

441
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,400
but I think it's important

442
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,361
is that every time you remind them
where everything is,

443
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,197
so that they start to learn.

444
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,324
To make-- Yes. I agree.

445
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,743
I'm going to adopt that, and...

446
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,703
I'm sure I won't have a problem.

447
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,623
They like teamwork, so, definitely.

448
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,874
[Iida speaks Japanese]

449
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,042
Thanks for sharing.

450
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,835
-[Iida speaks Japanese]
-[laughing]

451
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,670
-[speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] Thank you.

452
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,755
[Marie] Thank you.

453
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,382
[sighing]

454
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,679
-[Katrina] I want to load this bucket.
-Yes?

455
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,097
-With everything we can.
-Mm-hmm.

456
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,600
Take it out there,
so we can do it as a family.

457
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,517
Got it.

458
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,146
-I may get serious.
-[Katrina] Nolan! Kayci!

459
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,064
Calm down.

460
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,399
[Katrina] Everybody come
get one thing and we're done.

461
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,778
I got us in this hole,
let me get us out of it.

462
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,404
I feel like this is my chance

463
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:43,283
to redeem myself and to help the family.

464
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,701
So I'm excited.

465
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,620
-[Nolan] Yay.
-[Douglas] Bathroom's clear.

466
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,373
How are you guys feeling?
Did you know all this was in there?

467
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,290
[Douglas] Yeah.

468
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,292
I know you guys don't know...

469
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,628
where to find half this stuff.

470
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,797
This is the stuff you guys call me about.

471
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,007
-[Douglas] Yeah.
-So now that we can do this,

472
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,218
I'll know exactly where it is,

473
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,054
and more importantly,
you'll know exactly where it is.

474
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:04,972
Okay.

475
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:09,434
[Nolan]<i> </i>I want to learn
where I should put things,

476
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,645
but at the same time I kind of,
like my mom,

477
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,398
having to know where everything is,

478
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,525
because I don't have
to think about it as much.

479
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,567
[laughing]

480
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,362
That's the procrastinator
coming out in me.

481
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,740
Listen, you're gonna have
to take care of these things...

482
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,617
and find a home for them.

483
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,203
-Do you even have all the pieces?
-[Kayci] Yes.

484
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,248
-You have a knitting loom in here.
-Yes. Oh, wait, I knew that.

485
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,166
Let me talk about our new lifestyle.

486
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,794
If you opened this and saw this in here,

487
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,755
why not take this out
and go put it in its home?

488
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,507
Well, I didn't know to do that.

489
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,092
-[Katrina] So now--
-Now I do know.

490
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,052
-Let me ask you, does this have a home?
-Yes.

491
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,471
-Where?
-In my drawer.

492
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,265
[Katrina] At the end of this process,

493
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,100
I want my children,

494
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,562
my husband, and myself,
I want our family...

495
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,772
to know how to organize,

496
00:21:56,356 --> 00:22:00,110
for the sake of having a home
and not just a house.

497
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,448
[birds chirping]

498
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,325
-[Kayci] <i>Douglas.</i>
-[Nolan] <i>I'm chilling.</i>

499
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,160
-You can do whatever you want.
-Mm-hmm.

500
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,164
But, just know
we've got some homework to do.

501
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,374
-[Douglas] Hey.
-[Katrina, on FaceTime] <i>Hey!</i>

502
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,252
So, when I came in, I was like,
"What's going on here?"

503
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,463
All this stuff is crazy.

504
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,256
[Katrina]<i> That's trash.</i>

505
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,259
This is all trash.
The box underneath is trash.

506
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,220
<i>You can take out all of that trash,</i>
<i>and the only reason I didn't,</i>

507
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:30,015
<i>I love you so much,</i>
<i>is because it was raining.</i>

508
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,517
Alright. Okay, thank you.
I'll talk to you later.

509
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,645
Duties in the house. We all do cleaning.

510
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:39,316
We all try to manage, um...

511
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,569
-Ahem!
-What?

512
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,696
Dad doesn't clean?

513
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,825
Dad doesn't do the bathroom.
Dad doesn't do the kitchen.

514
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,118
Not as much as you.

515
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,204
-Okay, hold on.
-That was-- Yeah, we do it way more.

516
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:55,582
I'll say this, you guys do do those areas
more than me.

517
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,251
But I do cleaning
when you guys are asleep,

518
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,213
picking up your backpacks,
picking up your socks,

519
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,298
picking up your shoes, sweeping.

520
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,675
I like to think of that
as straightening up.

521
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,719
-Yeah. I hear you.
-[laughing]

522
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,096
Ah!

523
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,683
-You flinched!
-You guys working nicely in there?

524
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,060
[Kayci and Nolan] Yeah.

525
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:16,978
Let's get to work.

526
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,440
-I have get the mail, take out the trash.
-Write it down.

527
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,526
-Recycling.
-You get the mail?

528
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,653
-Yes, I do get the mail.
-[Kayci laughing]

529
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,279
I'm laughing at you two.

530
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,031
These-- These just...

531
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,158
-Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie!
-[laughing]

532
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,244
-It's a lie.
-[Nolan] Oh, my--

533
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,372
-I'm so excited about you helping.
-[Douglas] Yeah.

534
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,124
You can put these back.

535
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:40,168
No. I was, uh, putting 'em out for drying.

536
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,546
I'm not gonna dry the clean dishes
with those towels

537
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,423
-'cause those are not clean.
-Got it.

538
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,010
[Douglas] <i>I feel guilty about Katrina</i>
<i>having the majority of the housework.</i>

539
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,638
That's one of the reasons
why I've been trying to be more active,

540
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:55,225
you know, with the cleaning
and the chores and the duties.

541
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,311
I can organize certain things
that I feel confident in,

542
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:02,315
but certain things
I just don't feel confident in just yet.

543
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,193
I left you this space.
You can keep sitting 'em right there.

544
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:08,029
-I didn't wanna do that.
-[Katrina] You can sit that right there.

545
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,406
What did you wanna do, Dad?

546
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,366
Yeah, it doesn't even matter.

547
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,410
How do you want me to grab 'em,
and dry 'em?

548
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,328
No, no, no, that's fine.

549
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,039
[Katrina]
<i>I'm thankful to get help from my family.</i>

550
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,625
Even though they're still, I think,
a long way to go,

551
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,295
I feel like my family is off
to a good start.

552
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,173
-[Marie] Hi, hello.
-[Katrina squeals]

553
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,468
-It's Marie. Hi!
-[Douglas] Hi!

554
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,760
[Katrina] Marie and Marie!

555
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,264
-Hi!
-[Douglas] It's been too long.

556
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,932
-[Katrina] Too long.
-We've missed you.

557
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,517
[Marie speaking Japanese]

558
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,769
We're gonna work together on the--
in the kitchen.

559
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,354
-Together. I'm okay.
-Yes.

560
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,689
[Marie speaking Japanese]

561
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:47,360
[Iida] Douglas, I'd love for you to work
on sentimental items, the last category.

562
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,946
I know that all the steps
that you've gone through

563
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,156
was very, very difficult.

564
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:54,493
All throughout, you've sharpened
your decision-making skills,

565
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,954
so you should be confident in your ability
to go through your sentimental items.

566
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:02,542
Alright, I'll start pulling the things out
to start the process. Thank you.

567
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,461
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-[laughing]

568
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,712
-Alright.
-Good luck.

569
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,672
Right. Good luck, I need it.

570
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,091
-Good luck to you.
-Wish me luck. Right.

571
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,093
-I'm nervous.
-Good luck. She's scared.

572
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,303
[girls laughing]

573
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,764
So, the items that are sentimental,

574
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:20,185
we're going to try to categorize those
for each individual.

575
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,521
So if you come across something
that you know that's Mom's,

576
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,272
put it in Mom's sentimental pile.

577
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,732
-[Douglas] Alright?
-[Nolan] Yeah.

578
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,234
[Katrina] No.

579
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,528
Thank you.

580
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,531
[Marie, in Japanese]
Something smells good.

581
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,741
American trash bags are amazing!

582
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,953
It smells so good.
American garbage bags smell nice.

583
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,120
[Katrina laughing]

584
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:42,123
This cabinet is ridiculous.
It's hard to reach.

585
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,167
[Marie speaking Japanese]

586
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:47,837
[Iida] Going forward, let's try to keep
things that we don't use as frequently

587
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,881
in hard-to-reach places like that.

588
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,264
[in Japanese]
When using kitchen cabinets,

589
00:25:57,347 --> 00:26:00,684
in the area that is easily accessible,
store items that are used often

590
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:04,854
such as plates, glasses, and mugs.

591
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,148
On the top shelf,

592
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:11,528
store items that are used less often,
such as seasonal plates,

593
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,446
and plates for guests.

594
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,659
Paper plates and straws are also items
that are used less often.

595
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:21,162
These types of items
can become easily accessible

596
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,706
if stored in a box.

597
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,669
-Maybe a little bit more safe.
-[Katrina] Thank you.

598
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,421
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] This one?

599
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,256
Yeah, Nolan just decided to keep it.

600
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:34,759
It was a sippy cup his godmother
bought for him and it's engraved.

601
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,386
-Yeah.
-And we asked him,

602
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,014
"Will you drink out of it?"
He's like "Yes, yes." And we're like--

603
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,099
[Iida translating]

604
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,310
We can put it with your trophies
or in the kitchen.

605
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,812
He said, "Put it in the kitchen.
Put it in the kitchen."

606
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:49,691
[Iida] Okay, so let's make this
a decoration for the kitchen.

607
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,444
-We'll decide a nice place for it later.
-[Katrina] Okay.

608
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,446
[Katrina] <i>I love the way...</i>

609
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,906
she doesn't make
any of the family members feel bad

610
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,075
about what they wanna keep,
or what they don't.

611
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,201
I mean, I'm learning.

612
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,870
[speaking Japanese]

613
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,206
[Iida] That's very important when
you're tidying, to respect each other.

614
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,500
Having a family of my own
and being a mother,

615
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,628
and I think that the things in our house

616
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,881
and all the family members in a home
kind of function the same way.

617
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,718
We each play a role and we only have
a limited amount of space

618
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,220
-and we all need each other.
-That's true. It's so true.

619
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,181
I understand. Thank you.

620
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,098
[Douglas] Thank you.

621
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:27,520
[Douglas] This process that Marie's
helping us with is uncovering layers,

622
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,689
not just<i> </i>to material things,

623
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,609
but, like, the layers between our dynamic
with our family.

624
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,320
Mom, she's been the one that

625
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:39,032
has been trying to keep us all together
and keep us organized,

626
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:42,827
and, so, now that we have
this tidying method,

627
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:46,039
I feel like we really need to keep it up.

628
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,499
-[Kayci] Mm-hmm.
-You know?

629
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,001
Not just for her,

630
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,420
but for ourselves, you know?

631
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,839
Before, I had the wrong mentality

632
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:58,426
to not want to engage and help,
and even...

633
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,846
not see the value
of learning something like this.

634
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:06,059
But, now, I realize the responsibility
should not be on Mom.

635
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,561
It should be on the family,
the members of that house.

636
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,856
[Douglas]
I'm gonna be the laundry champion.

637
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,775
[Katrina]
You gonna be able to sort it, too?

638
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,112
I'll assist you with sorting,
so I can learn.

639
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,489
-[Katrina] Mm-hmm?
-Gonna be a laundry champion.

640
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,241
[Katrina] Alright.

641
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,701
Stay on top of it.

642
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,370
[Douglas] <i>I didn't realize the pressure of</i>

643
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:28,707
<i>having to do everything</i>
<i>until I actually did it.</i>

644
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,584
So now I do want to help
with that a lot more.

645
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:36,423
I am working on organizing more of

646
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,049
my studio equipment...

647
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,553
that was under the printer area.

648
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,931
[Douglas] So all of your items
pretty much fit in your closet now.

649
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:45,849
Yeah.

650
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,976
[Douglas] Lot of hard work,
you're doing a great job.

651
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,018
Thank you.

652
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,813
[Douglas] <i>Nolan and Kayci,,</i>
<i>they're doing a terrific job.</i>

653
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,942
[Katrina] <i>I'm literally looking at their</i>
<i>shelves and how they're organizing.</i>

654
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,320
I can't believe

655
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,698
<i>they did it without me.</i>

656
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,200
You just feel so proud.

657
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,787
Our life is finally coming together.
That's how-- That's how I feel.

658
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,289
[Douglas] The kids are doing great.

659
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,958
You're doing great,
I'm trying to keep the energy high.

660
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,252
-We're gonna get through this.
-[Katrina] Awesome.

661
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,671
I'm definitely getting
instant gratification.

662
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:22,427
For one, I have the entire Fantastic Four
doing it with me.

663
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,138
[Douglas]
This is looking pretty good, guys.

664
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:29,058
I came around to check on everybody
and I saw the most amazing thing.

665
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,978
-[Douglas] What'd you see, Mom?
-Everybody had everything folded.

666
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,564
-They had it lined up, standing.
-Especially me.

667
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,609
Nice and neat on its own,
socks, underwear,

668
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,153
-shorts, anything that was difficult.
-Especially me.

669
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,197
-They had it all. Dad.
-[Douglas] I had it.

670
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,617
He had it all in a file system.

671
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:48,453
I could cry.
Like, my family is becoming a family.

672
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:52,290
My family is growing,
my kids are doing their own thing.

673
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:56,628
My kids know how to take care
of their resources.

674
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,671
New day, new joy!<i> </i>Whoo-hoo!

675
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,466
[Kayci] <i>Marie brought a whole bunch of joy</i>
<i>upon our home.</i>

676
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,302
<i>I think my mom is way less...</i>

677
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,179
stressed out.

678
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,516
I can see it in her face,
I can see it in her movement.

679
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,768
She lifted the weight
off my mom's shoulders.

680
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,061
A lot of weight.

681
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,482
Because now me and my sister can do things
by ourselves without asking her.

682
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,442
Where you gonna put those to dry?

683
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:22,278
Uh, I'll lay a towel out,
or I'll just dry 'em.

684
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,905
You know where to get the towels from?

685
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,698
I do know where to get the towels from.

686
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,742
-[chuckles]
-You know where to put the towels back?

687
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,495
-I know where to put the towels back.
-Okay, just checking.

688
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,706
[laughing]
I trust you. I trust you. I trust you.

689
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,000
This method has helped us to grow up.

690
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,045
I know for sure me.
I'm saying us, but I'm saying me.

691
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,505
I'm growing up here.

692
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,673
-You're growing up.
-Yeah.

693
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,143
[Marie, in Japanese]
I'm looking forward to this.

694
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,396
Everyone in the family
has worked very hard.

695
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,148
[Marie] Hello!

696
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,276
-Oh, hi!
-Hi!

697
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,528
-Hi, Kayci.
-Hi, Marie.

698
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:06,155
-So good to see you!
-Good to see you!

699
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,241
[in Japanese]
This place looks so lovely.

700
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,951
It's so lovely.

701
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:13,162
-We are so tired.
-[Marie laughing]

702
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,956
But so happy!

703
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,750
-[Douglas] Much different.
-This is amazing.

704
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,336
-It's beautiful.
-That's how we feel.

705
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,880
-Really proud.
-It was because of you.

706
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,506
-[Marie coos]
-[Iida speaking Japanese]

707
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,675
-[in Japanese] May I see the living room?
-Yes.

708
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:32,891
[Katrina] <i>So, Marie, this room is now</i>
<i>much, much larger right?</i>

709
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,184
[Marie, in Japanese]
<i>It really transformed!</i>

710
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,686
[Marie speaking Japanese]

711
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:41,357
[Iida] <i>Oh, the feeling around this TV</i>
<i>is just so different from before.</i>

712
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,818
-[Kayci] <i>It's nice and clean.</i>
-[Katrina] <i>Much different.</i>

713
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,447
[Iida] <i>Oh, and look at those</i>
<i>musical instruments.</i>

714
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,574
-[Douglas] <i>Joy. All around.</i>
-[Iida] <i>Beautiful there.</i>

715
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,868
-[Katrina] <i>You wanna see the kitchen?</i>
-[Douglas] <i>Let's go.</i>

716
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,536
Right this way. Yeah, you can come.

717
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,872
-[Douglas] I'm gonna wash my hands.
-[Kayci] I need a tour.

718
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,959
[Iida] <i>Oh, my God!</i>
-[Katrina laughing]

719
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,754
-[Iida] <i>This is incredible!</i>
<i>-</i>[Katrina] <i>That's how I feel.</i>

720
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:06,633
<i>I started making my decisions confidently.</i>

721
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,968
<i>Found my joy.</i>

722
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:12,138
[Douglas] It felt so good in here,
I even came in here

723
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,057
and made a salad for everybody.

724
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,309
-[Iida translating]
-I never come in here.

725
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:20,813
[Douglas] <i>Mom's been doing a great job.</i>
<i>She's been working really hard.</i>

726
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:21,898
[Marie speaking Japanese]

727
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,025
-[Iida] <i>Phenomenal job, Katrina.</i>
<i>-</i>[Katrina] <i>Thank you.</i>

728
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,611
-<i>It was well worth it.</i>
-[Douglas] <i>A lot more space. Feels great.</i>

729
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,405
[Katrina] <i>My husband picked up</i>
<i>the dry cleaning</i>

730
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,158
<i>and did the laundry and folded it.</i>

731
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,369
-[Marie] <i>Helpful!</i>
<i>-</i>[Katrina] <i>That was so helpful.</i>

732
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:39,082
<i>Alright, Nolan, Kayci,</i>
<i>come show Miss Marie your room!</i>

733
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,792
[Marie speaking Japanese]

734
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,585
[Iida] <i>Oh, how lovely!</i>

735
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,796
-[Marie gasps happily]
<i>-</i>[Iida] <i>Well done!</i>

736
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,881
<i>[Douglas] I was really happy</i>
<i>about the dressers</i>

737
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,968
<i>and them being able to utilize them.</i>

738
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,302
[Marie speaking Japanese]

739
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,263
-[Iida] <i>You guys worked so hard, I am so--</i>
-[Katrina] <i>We did.</i>

740
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,058
-[Douglas] <i>We wanted to make you proud.</i>
-[Katrina] <i>It's been a journey.</i>

741
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:01,312
And I think about
to when you first arrived, and...

742
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,024
<i>not only was the home all over the place,</i>

743
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,151
<i>-our lives were all over the place.</i>
-[Douglas] <i>Yeah.</i>

744
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,238
See, the biggest thing for us was...

745
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:15,493
that we didn't have the ability to know
how to declutter, how to tidy.

746
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:18,871
But now, we have the ability
to continue to help the...

747
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,834
the kids to learn it,
and they've learned it at this early age.

748
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,712
And, so, that was very important to me.

749
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,464
This house is finally a home.

750
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,092
I feel joy and I feel peace being here.

751
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,093
[Marie coos]

752
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,137
-Thank you so much.
-[Iida] Amazing job, thank you.

753
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,764
-[Douglas] Thank you.
-Thank you. Mm-hmm.

754
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,599
-[Katrina] <i>I feel proud.</i>
-[Douglas] <i>Yeah.</i>

755
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,476
I thought that moving here

756
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,271
and living in this space
was something I just had to take.

757
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,981
-Something I had to go through.
-Deal with.

758
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:45,940
Deal with.

759
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,318
-Safe travels to you. Safe travels.
-Alright, take care.

760
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,446
[in Japanese]
See you, thank you very much!

761
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,447
[Katrina] Bye.

762
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:56,117
You put your mind to it,
something you had no idea how to do,

763
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,160
something that...

764
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:01,039
-bossed you for so long like it had me.
-Indeed.

765
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,957
And now,

766
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,418
you can move anywhere and make it a home.

767
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,211
You just learned a life skill.

768
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,214
-You-- Your kids know a life skill.
-I can't wait to--

769
00:34:10,297 --> 00:34:12,967
-You're able to pass that on.
-Yeah. Indeed.

770
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,219
[Katrina] <i>It just-- It feels great.</i>
<i>It feels so great.</i>

00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:11,052
I'm so excited because I love mess.

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:14,347
[man] It's a never ending battle
to fight the clutter.

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,349
Oh!

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,019
I want things to be more simple.
I don't know how to fix it.

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,438
With the baby coming,
it's gonna be more chaos.

00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,567
[man] Oh, my God! We have too much stuff!

00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,028
Hello, I'm Marie Kondo.

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,279
[in Japanese] My mission

11
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,782
is to spark joy in the world

13
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,995
[narrator] <i>Best-selling author</i>

14
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:41,583
<i>Marie Kondo is dedicated to inspiring</i>
<i>the world to choose joy</i>

15
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,334
<i>with the KonMari Method.</i>

16
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,253
[in Japanese]
The KonMari method is unique because

17
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:48,214
I organize by category rather than
by location. In the KonMari method

18
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,718
we tidy five categories in a
specific order.

19
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,386
[in English] First, is clothing.

20
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,096

22
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,849
Next, is books.

23
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,852
[Iida] Giving them a little shake
and wake them up.

24
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,479
Then, paper.

25
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,438
[man sighs] I can't do the papers.

26
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,690
[deep groan]

27
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,027
The largest category is <i>komono.</i>

28
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,614
<i>Komono </i>is kitchen, bathroom,

29
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,740
and garage.

30
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,868
Everything miscellaneous.

31
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,163
Finally, sentimental items.

32
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,999
It's kinda hard to let it go,
'cause I really like this one.

33
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,212
[sniffling] This is kinda hard.

34
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:30,131
I don't want to just, you know, dump it.

35
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,093
But I want to be thoughtful about it.

36
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,554
[man 2] <i>From the moment she</i>
<i>set foot in our house,</i>

37
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,473
<i>she had this presence to her.</i>

38
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,767
She wants to see this place turned around.

39
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,895
Marie brought a whole bunch
of joy upon our home.

40
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,313
This is amazing.

41
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,440
[girl] You're so cute! I love you!

42
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,734
You're so cute I love you, too. [laughing]

43
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,028
These are, like, happy, happy tears.

44
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,197
Thank you for what you've brought
to our home, really.

45
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,162
[in Japanese] When you have young children

46
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:04,916
maintaining a tidy household
is a struggle.

47
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,711
In this episode we meet a couple
who have two young children

48
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:10,713
and are struggling to keep
 their house tidy

49
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,841
Rachel and Kevin.

50
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:17,846
The cluttered house seems to be affecting
their relationship as well.

51
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,516
I would like to help this couple focus on
what matters most to them,

[Rachel] Absolutely,
you can do whatever you want.

169
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,962
[Marie speaking Japanese]

170
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:04,340
[Iida] So, how do you separate them?
In categories, or...?

171
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,968
Um, I think-- So, I don't do it.

172
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,803
We have someone help us do it,

173
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,805
-like a laundry person.
-[Iida translating]

174
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:11,931
[in Japanese] Oh, I see.

175
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,558
'Cause I hate doing laundry.

176
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,685
We fight about laundry.

177
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,020
And it seems silly when I say it,

178
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,191
but really, it pisses me off, like, a lot.

179
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,611
It's not because
she doesn't do the laundry,

180
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,698
it's because we hire somebody
to come do it.

181
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,325
It's not like I'm saying, "Hey...

182
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,245
You do the laundry, you watch the kids,
you do the dishes."

183
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,372
-No, I know.
-I'm saying, no,  we gotta do this,

184
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,040
but let's do this as a family, like--

185
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,209
Hold on, babe.

186
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,170
-Okay, hold on a second.
-I'm ready.

187
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,797
[Rachel] With him working more,
I'm home with the kids more,

188
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,757
and it's freaking chaos.

189
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,135
My kids are just like
running around and being crazy

190
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,720
and we never get anything done.

191
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,389
So I think to myself,
"What's an easy resolution?"

192
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,308
If we don't have enough time,

193
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,102
then maybe we can pay somebody
to do these things,

194
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,562
and that way we have more time.

195
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,023
It's because we're perfectly capable
of doing those things.

196
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,983
Okay, time out.
I'm not saying we're not capable.

197
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,903
I'm just saying the reason
that this came up more and more

198
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,405
was because, babe, we don't have
the time to do these,

199
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,364
that's where it came.

200
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,407
We're different.

201
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,163
[Iida, in Japanese]
This is the kids' room.

202
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,499
[Rachel] So we have things under the bed.

203
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,292
-For them, the little bins.
-[Ryan] Daddy!

204
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,212
-'Cause they don't have much closet space.
-[Iida translates]

205
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,714
[Marie, in Japanese]
It must be hard to find things in here.

206
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:27,715
[Kevin] Oh, yeah.

207
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,218
[Marie, in Japanese]
I think I can make this easier to use.

208
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,513
I do like the rack, but I think
we can fix it so that it's easier to use.

209
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,765
-[Rachel gasps]
-[Kevin] Oh, my God!

210
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:37,390
-Was that planned
-[in Japanese] Please be careful!

211
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,644
-[Kevin] Oh, my God.
-[Rachel] Marie started tripping!

212
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,188
[Kevin]
We have too much stuff. It's official.

213
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,023
-[Iida translates]
-It's official.

214
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,734
-Did you just fall?
-I just fell!

215
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,778
-[Rachel laughing]
-I'll go food shopping.

216
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,821
[Kevin] Okay, you go shopping for food.
Okay.

217
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,490
I have a real problem in here.

218
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,451
When I go to get clothes for the kids,

219
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,161
half the stuff I grab...

220
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,704
is not the right size.

221
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,623
It's either too small or too big.

222
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,999
But Marie, I'll tell you...

223
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,793
-Want my mom.
-Okay, I'm coming.

224
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,920
-[Ryan] Mommy! Mommy!
-[Rachel] Yes, I hear you.

225
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,922
-Yes?
-[Ryan] Mom, I want boobies.

226
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:11,008
-We're gonna do boobies in just a minute.
-[in Japanese] What is "boobie"?

227
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:14,303
-[in Japanese] For breastfeeding.
-[in Japanese] Oh, that's what it is!

228
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,429
[Rachel] Yes, yes, um...

229
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,140
I want to sit on the floor with you.
[Jaxon whines]

230
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,684
You can sit-- Okay.

231
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,019
KonMari chair.

232
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,604
[laughing]

233
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,107
[Marie speaking Japanese]

234
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,359
[Iida] So both of you work?

235
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,485
[Rachel] He mostly works.

236
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,697
I teach Intercultural Communication,
a few days a week,

237
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,782
but I'm mostly home with the kids.

238
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:38,452
So, I was gonna say, ever since I had kids
was when I started to get really, like,

239
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,497
anxious about the house being, um...

240
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,916
not organized.

241
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,210
I'm 50-60 hours a week, yeah.

242
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,421
And then sometimes on the weekends, um,

243
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,257
I'm a sales manager for
a restaurant supply company.

244
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,050
So it becomes hectic

245
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,219
-and you have little energy.
-[Marie] Yeah.

246
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,721
-And you have little time.
-Yeah.

247
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,222
And then it becomes, like,

248
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,433
"All right, are you cleaning this up?
Am I doing this?"

249
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,475
[Iida translating]

250
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,562
The biggest fights we ever get into
are money and cleaning.

251
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:08,899
Rachel and the kids are definitely not
getting the best side of me.

252
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,778
That always has stuff piled up
and that's, like, medicine...

253
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,489
-I know, the medicine cabinet's up there.
-There's makeup over there.

254
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,617
-Like, none of that stuff goes there.
-Okay.

255
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,077
There are five--
There are seven pillows on this bed!

256
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,788
-I know, we each have one...
-Those aren't even decorative pillows.

257
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,500
I want to be a good dad,
but I don't know.

258
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,211
I don't know that I'm doing
that well with it.

259
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,130
Because I'm tired,

260
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,924
because I'm frustrated sometimes
about the house.

261
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,676
You know?

262
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,054
Among other things. And... [sighs]

263
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,681
Oh,, man, that sucks.
[clears throat]

264
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,975
That sucks to say.

265
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,853
That they're getting the worst of me,
sometimes.

266
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,438
Hmm.

267
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,609
-It seems like everything is so short.
-[Marie murmurs]

268
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:55,279
And so-- And there's not enough time
for us to just enjoy our lives.

269
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,489
-Yeah.
-You know what I mean?

270
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,574
[speaking Japanese]

271
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,327
I completely empathize,
it's a busy time for you.

272
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,288
[in Japanese]
Even my house gets cluttered sometimes.

273
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,539
[Rachel] I don't believe you.

274
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,291
[in Japanese} Secret.

275
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,335
-Just between you.
-[Rachel] Okay.

276
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,087
-[laughing]
-Do you want to see another one?

277
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,505
Let's continue on.

278
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,715
[Rachel] Okay come in here. Come on in.

279
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,967
[Marie speaking Japanese]

280
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,553
[Iida] American kitchens are so large!

281
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,971
They are? This is large?

282
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,098
[Iida translating]

283
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,225
[Marie speaking Japanese]

284
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,603
The kitchen in Japan, probably...

285
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,813
-Yes.
-Around here...

286
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,440
-[speaking Japanese]
-When I used to live by myself.

287
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,817
[Kevin] Wow!

288
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,276
[Ryan] Mom!

289
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,319
[Rachel] Yes, honey.

290
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,447
[Kevin] Jaxon!

291
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,908
[Rachel]
I mean, are your kids running all over?

292
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,661
Or are they just sitting saying,
"Mommy, whatever you tell me to do,

293
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,662
I'll do it."

294
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,580
Nooo!

295
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,959
-[Rachel] So, yeah, that's our silverware.
-Silverware, ah.

296
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,711
[Iida] What's this?

297
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,423
[Kevin] So, we go through a lot of dishes.

298
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,883
-So this is actually good.
-Mhm.

299
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,385
-Most of the time,
-[Iida translates]

300
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,888
there's dishes here,
there's other things piled there.

301
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,308
[Marie, in Japanese] Does this clutter
stress you out?

302
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,351
[Kevin] Yes.

303
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:12,064
This room is just, like, the worst room.
One of the worst ones.

304
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,900
You walk in and it's, like,
when it's not organized, it's annoying.

305
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,611
[Rachel] <i>I don't know what it is</i>
<i>about the kitchen.</i>

306
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,864
<i>Honestly, I feel like</i>
<i>I can never keep it clean.</i>

307
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,825
It was really after I had kids
that everything just came full front.

308
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,201
I'm like, I can't do all this.

309
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,203
I want my Mommy!

310
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,164
[screaming] No!

311
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,541
[Rachel] <i>Whether I'm constantly</i>
<i>feeding the kids snacks,</i>

312
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,877
<i>and then those moments</i>
<i>I go and bring the plates in there,</i>

313
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,462
<i>but I'm switching and they're yelling,</i>

314
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,047
<i>and really washing</i>
<i>and putting things away is unrealistic.</i>

315
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,841
<i>And then things would, like, load up more.</i>

316
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,135
<i>I don't necessarily know how to fix it</i>
<i>and it affects me.</i>

317
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,387
So, we're on board, we want to change.

318
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,765
I just want it to be strong enough
to change me.

319
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:46,932
[kids screaming]

320
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,768
[Rachel] You guys, come get comfortable.

321
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,103
[Marie, in Japanese]
They are tired, time for a nap.

322
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,355
[Ryan wailing]

323
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,066
[Marie, in Japanese] Okay, then...

324
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,943
[speaking in Japanese]

325
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,654
[Iida] I'd love to greet your house first.

326
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,072
-[gasps] I love that.
-I'm excited.

327
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:07,119
[in Japanese] So would you like to
try it with me?

328
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,037
Sure.

329
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,207
[in Japanese]
You can do it in your mind...

330
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,000
[Iida] All we're communicating
to the house

331
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,378
is that we're thanking it, first of all,
for always protecting you,

332
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,756
and that we are about to begin
this process of tidying.

333
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,258
Now I'm finding spot.

334
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,385
Okay. Maybe...

335
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,930
[whispering] Okay.

336
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,354
[peaceful music playing]

337
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,526
-[Marie] Close your eyes.
-Okay.

338
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,484
-[in Japanese] Okay we're finished.
-[Ida] Thank you very much.

339
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,239
You know, what's funny is
I obviously have never done that

340
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,740
or thought of doing that,

341
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,951
and it is nice to go,

342
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,496
"Yeah, this has been
a very good home for us."

343
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,294
Then I also got a sense of,
"Are we doing it justice?"

344
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:39,879
You know what I mean?

345
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,381
I don't know, like,
why I'm getting emotional, but...

346
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,258
I think he knows, I just--

347
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,345
I want things to be, like, more simple,
so I don't have to be so stressed,

348
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,388
but then..

349
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,515
I don't know how to fix it.
It's-- You know?

350
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,517
So I'm, I'm happy that you're here

351
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,936
'cause I want to feel, like, more calm.

352
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,397
I want to appreciate, like, what I have

353
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,566
instead of needing more things, you know?

354
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,736
Thank you for, like, being here for us

355
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,905
and wanting to help us
'cause I'm ready for it.

356
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,781
I know that we're ready for it. [sniffles]

357
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,992
[in Japanese] Thank you, I'm grateful
for you saying that.

358
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,703
[Marie speaking Japanese]

359
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,622
[Iida, translating]
The ultimate goal of tidying

360
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,583
is really to learn to cherish
everything that you have,

361
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,085
so that you can achieve happiness
for your family

362
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,879
so that you can live comfortably.

363
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,381
[Marie speaking Japanese]

364
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:28,052
[Iida] So, with those visions
in our hearts, let's begin tidying.

365
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,347
Yeah, do you want to put them in bed
and then whatever we need to do?

366
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,057
-[Kevin] Yeah.
-Okay, perfect.

367
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,893
[Rachel] Shh, shh, shh.

368
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,356
[in Japanese]
What is your impression of this family?

369
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,985
[in Japanese]
I feel they are a warm and loving family

370
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,363
the moment I entered the house.

371
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,823
[Iida] <i>The kids are so cute as well.</i>

372
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,825
[Marie] <i>So cute!</i>
<i>They really are soothing.</i>

373
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,118
<i>You're absolutely right.</i>

374
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,246
[Iida] <i>I think this house will become</i>
<i>even more lovely.</i>

375
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,082
It's lovely now, of course,
but even more so.

376
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,125
[in Japanese]
I know things will be better.

377
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,127
[Iida, in Japanese]
I'm looking forward to it.

378
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,302
[speaking Japanese]

379
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,806
Take all the clothes from
everywhere in the house

380
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,725
and pile it into one big mountain.

381
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,227
-Oh.
-Right now?

382
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,063
[Iida] Rachel, here, Kevin,
in the living room.

383
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,399
All of your clothes, right now.
Every single piece.

384
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,068
-Oh, my gosh.
-I'm grabbing everything from my closets

385
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,695
and putting it in here?

386
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,780
-And your drawers.
-[in Japanese] The bed is good.

387
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,074
-The bed would be great. Just pull it out.
-Oh, my God!

388
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,994
-[in Japanese] Let's begin with that.
-And let's create a pile.

389
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,453
-All right, let's do it.
-Okay.

390
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,248
[Rachel] Oh, my God, babe, no...

391
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,375
Oh, my God.

392
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,838
It is awesome to look
at this pile all at once.

393
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,007
I mean, I get it, Marie, you look sweet,

394
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,676
but on the inside
you really mean business.

395
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,386
[Marie] Yes, I might be.

396
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,847
-[Rachel] You might be?
-[all laughing]

397
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,892
[Rachel] My husband's gonna question
why he married me now.

398
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,271
[Kevin] Oh, my gosh, this is awesome.

399
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,398
That's it. Those are just scarves.

400
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,651
[whispering] Okay.

401
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,573
[Rachel] Oh, my gosh.

402
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,496
[Rachel] This is embarrassing.

403
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't know why it's embarrassing,
but for some reason I have so much stuff.

404
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,127
-[Iida translating]
-No, it's insane.

405
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,128
I'm just looking at things
I don't even know.

406
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,048
One, I feel like I don't need this.

407
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,717
And two, I feel like there's<i> </i>people
who don't have--

408
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,677
I don't know why, like,
I started feeling guilty.

409
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,846
I actually feel kind of
uncomfortable right now.

410
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,890
I'm getting hot and cold. I really do.

411
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,224
It's weird.

412
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,768
[nervous chuckle]

413
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,103
[speaking Japanese]

414
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,065
[Iida] Only when you actually
are confronted

415
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,234
with how much exactly you have,
you start to realize,

416
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,236
yeah, what you need to do.

417
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,114
[Marie whispers] Okay. Great.

418
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:58,994
[in Japanese] So from here you will choose
what you will keep.

419
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,831
You will only keep items that
spark joy for you.

420
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,251
[in English] The important
is to hold each item one by one.

421
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,586
Okay. Oh, my gosh.

422
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:11,548
When you touch the item
that sparks joy for you...

423
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,466
Okay.

424
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,842
...um, you feel...

425
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,552
-Ching!
-Okay.

426
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,013
Ching! Okay, okay.

427
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,099
All of your cells are rising.

428
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,642
[Rachel] Yes, okay, wow.

429
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,228
[peaceful music playing]

430
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,942
[in Japanese] Do you know what it feels
like when you spark joy?

431
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,528
You feel it when you hold a puppy,

432
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,405
or when you wear your favorite outfit.

433
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,908
It's a warm and positive feeling.

434
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,952
That's how it feels  when something
"sparks joy."

435
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:44,289
Some of you may not know
how that feels yet

436
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,874
but please do not worry.

437
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,918
Your sensitivity to joy

438
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,171
will be honed as you progress
through the tidying process.

439
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,133
-Are we ready?
-[girls chuckle]

440
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,260
So weird.
This first thing you picked up,

441
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,846
I definitely don't really want this,
I could tell.

442
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,931
[speaking Japanese]

443
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:04,309
[Iida] When you let go of an item,
you must thank it.

444
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,812
-[Marie] Thank you.
-Thank you for letting me wear you.

445
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,397
-[Marie] Yeah!
-I like that, okay.

446
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,899
These guys...

447
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,901
-I like these.
-Mhm.

448
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,696
Yes, these are really comfortable,
I wear these a lot.

449
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,240
-So...
-[Iida translating]

450
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,575
Okay, they spark joy.

451
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,202
[Rachel] Okay, I don't know what this is.

452
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,789
I'm already looking at it and knowing
I don't want it, so thank you.

453
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,000
My God, I could've got rid
of all of these.

454
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,210
-[speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] Be gentle, though!

455
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,963
-Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry!
-[Marie laughs]

456
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,673
Thank you, let me put this in.

457
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,593
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-[Rachel] These ones...

458
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,470
So, you continue on,
and let's move on to Kevin.

459
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,639
-Oh.
-Perfect. Good luck, babe.

460
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,641
-Have fun. Jeez.
-Thank you.

461
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,394
No. Thank you.

462
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,688
-[Marie] And do the same thing.
-[Kevin] Okay.

463
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,649
[Marie, in Japanese] Wow this is heavy.

464
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,319
[Marie speaking Japanese]

465
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,696
[Iida] Same thing for you, Kevin.

466
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,239
-[Kevin] Okay.
-[Iida] Same process.

467
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,367
Okay, this shirt I have absolutely
no attachment to.

468
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,994
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

469
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,246
[Kevin] Uh-oh.

470
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,917
-[Rachel] Oh, really?
-[Kevin exhales]

471
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,835
-Babe.
-This is an old shirt.

472
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,795
-But this shirt...
-[Rachel] Just stop.

473
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,131
...is so comfortable. I love this shirt.

474
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,758
When's the last time you wore it?

475
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,177
[speaking Japanese]

476
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:24,264
Rachel, as a rule, focus only
the clothes that belongs to you.

477
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,975
I'm sorry. Okay. It's just hard when--
Okay.

478
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,602
[peaceful music playing]

479
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,271
[Marie, in Japanese]

480
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,565
When folding, it's important
to convey love to your clothes

481
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,442
from the palms of your hands.

482
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,569
By doing this, you will start to
like folding clothes.

483
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:42,074
[in English] Folding is not just
making your clothes smaller.

484
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,160
It is actually an important opportunity

485
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,955
to talk to your clothes and thank them.

486
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,123
[in Japanese] By repeating this,

487
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,668
you'll learn to love folding.

488
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,835
[Rachel] Wow.

489
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,671
[Marie speaking Japanese]

490
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,798
[Iida, translating]
So what you're aiming for

491
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,926
is to create a rectangle
at the center of the clothes.

492
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,679
[Marie] Fold in half.

493
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,311
[Marie, in Japanese]
After this, in the end,

494
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,398
fold into thirds.

495
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,319
[Iida, translating] And you should
be aiming for this small rectangle.

496
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,029
-[Rachel] It's so little.
-[Kevin] Wow.

497
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,283
[Marie, in Japanese] We will store these
standing in the drawer.

498
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,742
[Rachel] Oh, my gosh, okay.

499
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,869
-[speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] So, can you try with me?

500
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,498
-Oh! Sure, okay.
-You should tuck in the sleeves first.

501
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,083
[Rachel] I feel like I did it too far.

502
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,585
[Marie, in Japanese]
You should fold that back once.

503
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,796
-[Kevin] Oh, come back.
-[Marie] Come back.

504
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,757
Okay, so this way? Or all the way?

505
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,094
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-Leave a little gap at the bottom.

506
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,972
[Marie, in Japanese] Your folding will
end up smoother with the gap.

507
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,348
-This looks good?
-Yeah.

508
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,225
[Rachel] Oh, my God.

509
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,644
I mean, it's kinda messy.

510
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,688
That's better than you've
ever done before.

511
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:55,689
[laughing]

512
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,733
[Rachel] Babe, yours looks so good!

513
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,569
[Marie speaking Japanese]

514
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,903
[Iida] Jeans, like this.

515
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,699
It's quite simple, just fold in half.

516
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,452
[Marie] And fold in half.

517
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,746
And fold in thirds.

518
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,748
[Rachel] Oh, thirds as well.

519
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,751
[Marie] And standing.

520
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:16,960
[Rachel] Oh.

521
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,546
Oh, that's gonna make me
be able to see all those jeans.

522
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,174
-[Iida speaking Japanese]
-Oh, my God, I'm excited.

523
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,384
[speaking Japanese]

524
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,012
So, you will be doing
this folding method

525
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,764
for all the clothes
you've decided to keep.

526
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,768
The clothes that you've folded,
try stacking them in your drawers nicely.

527
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,102
Like, when the kids are here,

528
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,104
even though I want to include them,

529
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,773
like, how do we--

530
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,858
how do we get all this stuff done,
like...?

531
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,526
[speaking Japanese]

532
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,864
I highly recommend doing this
with your kids. They love it.

533
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:50,077
[in Japanese] Like reading a book, it's
a habit to fold clothes with my children.

534
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,496
We often do it together before bedtime.

535
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:56,792
[in English] Of course, sometimes
when I fold clothes,

536
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,835
my daughters crush.

537
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,587
[Rachel]
So, what do you do in those times?

538
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,923
[in Japanese] I do scold them.

539
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,216
I ask them not to pull it out.

540
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,802
[Iida]
Of course I tell them not to pull it out.

541
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:07,928
Well, shoot. Okay.

542
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,013
[speaking Japanese]

543
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,264
So, yeah, just try.

544
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,975
[Rachel] Yeah. No, we gotta to see
how it works for us, you're right.

545
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,937
Don't let us fail, okay?
Hold us accountable.

546
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,271
[speaking Japanese]

547
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,190
-I will be, don't worry.
-[Kevin laughs]

548
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,359
Well, thank you.
Thank you for coming into our home.

549
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,194
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you very much.

550
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,613
You're welcome, we're gonna see you
next week. I'm excited.

551
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,031
-Thank you.
-[speaking Japanese]

552
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,741
I'm looking forward to seeing you.

553
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,119
-[Rachel] Bye, guys, be safe.
-[Marie] Bye! Thank you!

554
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,286
[Kevin] Thank you so much.

555
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,288
Take care. Drive safe.

556
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,373
[Marie] Yeah. Bye!

557
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,875
Oh, my God.

558
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,753
[Rachel] I definitely am nervous.
We have a lot of stuff.

559
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,010
[Kevin] Are you still focused
on what gives you joy?

560
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,097
I can be focused and overwhelmed
at the same time.

561
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,098
Okay, good. That's it.

562
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,975
I'll tell you what's not bringing me joy

563
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,935
is that I have to fold,
I'll be honest with you.

564
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,979
[Kevin] Can I say something else?

565
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:01,189
Yes, I know, yours is easier than mine.

566
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,400
-That's not-- [Kevin laughs]
-I know, but okay.

567
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,694
I'm just gonna say it,
I hate laundry, okay?

568
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,320
That actually gives me anxiety.

569
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,949
[Rachel] <i>But I know that if Kevin and I</i>
<i>continue our habits,</i>

570
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,993
<i>my kids are gonna be the exact same.</i>

571
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,412
And so if I could think
of giving them something

572
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,290
to allow them to take care
of their lives, put it in order,

573
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,709
that's enough motivation for me too.

574
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,836
[Rachel] How about this, do you like this?

575
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,754
-Yeah.
-[grunts] Oh, me too!

576
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,008
Okay, Ryan, what about this guy?

577
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,177
-No.
-Good job!

578
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,637
-Say thank you.
-Thank you.

579
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,015
-[lip smack]
-We got to put it away.

580
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:36,725
[Jaxon] <i>I wet my pants.</i>

581
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,435
You would put water on your pants?

582
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,729
All over your shirt?
Oh, is that the coffee?

583
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,272
Oh, man.

584
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,859
-You had a rough day.
-I want a napkin.

585
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,737
[laughing]
I don't think a napkin's gonna do it, man!

586
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,113
-[Rachel] Kev?
-What?

587
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,532
[Rachel] Do we have a bin
to put a bunch of hangers in?

588
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,035
I have a ton of hangers
I don't want us to throw away.

589
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,119
Oh, oh, we got--

590
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,079
-You don't want to throw 'em away?
-Honey...

591
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,874
We shouldn't get rid of hangers.
Those are-- We paid money for those.

592
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,376
If we don't use them,
we'll have one little spot in the garage.

593
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,047
Do you use 200 hangers
with no clothes to put hangers on--?

594
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,966
Maybe she'll-- Will you use them?
Do they bring you joy?

595
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,261
-Babe, you don't even know--
-A bin full of hangers brings you joy?

596
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,348
Hold on, do they keep you up at night
that we have hangers in the garage?

597
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,893
[Kevin] <i>Rachel and I, before the kids,</i>
<i>there was a little less tension.</i>

598
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,646
A little less frustration,
a little more sleep.

599
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,857
You know, and so things
were a little bit easier.

600
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,735
If you buy more clothes to fill that up,
we're gonna have a problem.

601
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:31,071
-[kids shouting]
-Hey. Okay, guess what?

602
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,949
[yelling, giggling]

603
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:37,702
I hope that this will get out of the way

604
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:41,331
the things that are keeping us
from enjoying each other.

605
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,750
Because we really--
We do, we talk about it.

606
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,585
You know, we "talk about it."

607
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,462
And then there's just no time. [sighs]

608
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,381
There's no time or energy.

609
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,761
[birds chirping]

610
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,725
[speaking Japanese]

611
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,024
[Iida, in Japanese]
You brought a lot of stuff today.

612
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:11,945
[Marie, in Japanese] Yes, I did. I just
brought boxes from my house.

613
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,239
-[Rachel] Honey!
-[Kevin] Don't clean your room!

614
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,574
Just go through the clothes.

615
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,826
[Rachel] What are you talking about,
"cleaning my room?"

616
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,120
[Kevin] You don't have to get
everything out.

617
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:23,331
[Rachel] That was her rule!
She said get everything out onto a pile.

618
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,249
-[knocking]
-Oop.

619
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:30,463
-[Rachel screams] Marie!
-[Kevin] Hi! What is this?

620
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,882
-Hi! We're so excited you're here!
-Hi, hi.

621
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,551
-[Rachel] Come in.
-Good to see you.

622
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,303
What is this
and why are you holding a box?

623
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,179
[in Japanese] I figured that today,

624
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,141
you'd need to store little things.

625
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,809
-Oh, my goodness.
-[Rachel] What is this?

626
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,520
[Iida] We'll be taking care
of the storage of miscellaneous items,

627
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,814
so I thought these might come in handy.

628
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,649
[peaceful music playing]

629
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,696
[in Japanese]
Miscellaneous items include

630
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,240
everything except

631
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,326
clothes, books, documents,
and sentimental items.

632
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:04,164
I always use boxes when tidying
miscellaneous items.

633
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:08,418
By using boxes, you can
compartmentalize

634
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,587
the drawers neatly.

635
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,965
[Marie, in Japanese]

636
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,302
[Iida] So I think we're gonna focus
on the kitchen and the garage today.

637
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,346
So, how about, Rachel,
you focus on the kitchen

638
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,847
and, Kevin, you'll do the garage.

639
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,642
[in Japanese]

640
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,186
[speaking Japanese]

641
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,522
[Iida] Let's proceed with utensils
you use to cook with.

642
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,400
Little tools like this, everything.
Out on the counter.

643
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,693
[Rachel] I'll do that first.

644
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,321
So I'll stay in here
and then you guys take Kevin?

645
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,697
Yes, Kevin will tidy the garage.

646
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,699
Okay, good luck.

647
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,785
-See you soon.
-Bye.

648
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,244
[laughing]

649
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,913
-Bye.
-[Marie] Bye.

650
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:51,211
[in Japanese] What category of things
do you have in here?

651
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,046
yWill you give us a general idea?

652
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:57,008
[Kevin] Most of this is just random stuff.

653
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:00,762
[In Japanese] In that case,
let's take everything out of here as well.

654
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,681
[peaceful music playing]

655
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,102
[in Japanese]
When you tidy your garage,

656
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,562
you should take everything out.

657
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,690
<i>Then sort the items into categories.</i>

658
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,817
<i>If you encounter sentimental items</i>

659
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,944
<i>while tidying,</i>

660
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,613
I recommend that you address them last,

661
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,740
when your sensitivity to joy has
become sufficiently heightened.

662
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,619
[Kevin] So your garage at home...

663
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,956
-[Iida translating]
-How simple is it?

664
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,290
[in Japanese] In my garage?

665
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,585
[in Japanese]
Just my Christmas decorations.

666
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,753
Wow, okay.

667
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,380
[Marie speaking Japanese]

668
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:38,717
[Iida] That's not to say I'm perfect.
I do have a section in my garage

669
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,301
where I just kind of keep things

670
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,721
that I meant to store,
but it's temporary space.

671
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,890
All right, I feel a little bit better,
but I'm gonna go at it.

672
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,225
I'm gonna go after it.

673
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,644
[Marie, in Japanese]
Let's keep moving along.

674
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:53,231
[in English]
The box is for all the photos...

675
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,568
[Kevin] Marie, there's so much
just junk here, it's crazy.

676
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,155
[in Japanese]
These cords are all tangled.

677
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,072
[Kevin] Yeah.

678
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,825
[in Japanese]
Do you wish that you had more

679
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,910
personal items in your house?

680
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,912
The only thing that I do...

681
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:13,168
definitely want in the house
is picture frames of the kids,

682
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,003
so that's something that we keep saying,

683
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,630
"Okay, we got to get that,
we got to do that," and we just don't.

684
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,592
And, so, that's something that
I don't want to put off anymore.

685
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,761
-[speaking Japanese]
-[Kevin] Wow.

686
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,679
These can go bye-bye.

687
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,056
[speaking Japanese]

688
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,641
[Iida] Oh, my gosh, this is so lovely.

689
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,435
-[Kevin chuckles]
-This is from your wedding?

690
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:33,646
[Kevin] Yeah, it's the--
made a little video out of it.

691
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,399
-Yeah.
-[in Japanese] It's so beautiful.

692
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,651
[Marie speaking Japanese]

693
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:39,778
Do you ever watch this?

694
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,739
[Kevin] Like, after our first year,
first anniversary, we watched it.

695
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,200
[speaking Japanese]

696
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,245
Today's my wedding anniversary, actually.

697
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,456
Today's your anniversary?
Happy anniversary! What?

698
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,666
-Thank you!
-Oh, wow!

699
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,128
[in Japanese] Today we are apart since I
am working, so this made me a bit jealous.

700
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,089
-Oh, really?
-[Iida] He's not with me today.

701
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,926
-Wow.
-[in Japanese] I miss him.

702
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,721
Wow, I have not seen that
in at least four years.

703
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,264
We were married five years ago.

704
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,977
[Kevin] <i>So think maybe</i>
<i>we watched it once, a year in,</i>

705
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,773
<i>and then it got tucked away</i>
<i>along with pictures of my kids and...</i>

706
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:20,318
<i>It doesn't feel good having</i>
<i>that stuff tucked away.</i>

707
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,404
<i>We're at a time in our life,</i>

708
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,658
<i>Rachel and I, where it's too easy</i>
<i>to be on the go all the time</i>

709
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,285
and then not realize that you're
just slowly, like...

710
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,538
you know, sort of falling--

711
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,873
like, working apart, growing apart.

712
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,835
<i>It's probably that time now</i>
<i>when it's most important</i>

713
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,795
<i>to stay strong and to work together</i>

714
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,422
<i>instead of, kind of,</i>
<i>fighting against each other...</i>

715
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,425
in the midst of all of that stuff
that we're dealing with.

716
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,888
Hi!

717
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:49,889
Hi!

718
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,851
[Rachel] This is where I'm at so far.
So I emptied this out.

719
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:56,145
I made sure every one of them
that I had, had a top to it.

720
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,815
[speaking Japanese]

721
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,275
-Very good.
-Okay.

722
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,652
[Rachel I'm just finding a better way
to organize it.

723
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,779
[speaking Japanese]

724
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,865
Yes, I do agree that this is a good spot
for them.

725
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:07,782
Oh, okay.

726
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,368
[speaking Japanese]

727
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,745
Let's stand everything upright.

728
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,832
[Iida] When you stack them up like this,

729
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:19,252
you can see, in one shot,
how much you have.

730
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,838
[Rachel]
Standing up when possible. Yes, I like it.

731
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,006
To be honest,

732
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:26,426
the kitchen I'm a little nervous
because I'm in here so much making stuff.

733
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:30,555
How do I really keep it up when this place
is where a lot of things happen?

734
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,640
[speaking Japanese]

735
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:36,311
[Iida] Approach it in a lighter way
'cause it's never going to be perfect.

736
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,395
But with that said,

737
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:41,190
it'll help immensely if you have
a designated spot for everything.

738
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:45,111
Is there ever a time where there
are things out of order at your house?

739
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,447
-[speaking Japanese]
-Of course.

740
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,656
[laughing]

741
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,577
[in Japanese] In fact, if I'm really
exhausted, I'll just go to sleep.

742
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,662
Okay, I like this.

743
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,915
[speaking Japanese]

744
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,416
But we have a lot to cover, so...

745
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,752
I know, I am still excited.
Okay, let's do it, let's do it.

746
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,969
[Kevin]
Here is sort of the progress right here.

747
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,974
So I've got everything
sort of thrown in the middle.

748
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:18,394
There's six-plus bags of garbage here.

749
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,150
Hey, Mom's just going through some stuff,
okay?

750
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,568
I want boobies.

751
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,112
'Kay, give me a few minutes
and we'll do some boobies, okay?

752
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,073
[Rachel gasping] Wow!

753
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,616
Okay? Is this okay?

754
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,243
[Rachel]
<i>"Miscellaneous" is like the entire house.</i>

755
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:35,995
<i>I'm a little nervous.</i>

756
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,081
<i>I feel like it's gonna take us some time.</i>

757
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,541
And if you can't tell, I'm really tired.

758
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,544
We're tired 'cause we've been staying up
late to do everything.

759
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,172
[Rachel] This is what her kitchen
looks like right now.

760
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,467
There's stuff everywhere. Hey, bud.

761
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,845
I think we're on to these bottom cabinets.
I think the top ones are...

762
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,305
Cleared out.

763
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,475
[Rachel] We've filled up a couple
trash bins. We're on our second one now.

764
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,978
<i>I will say that my anxiety...</i>

765
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,939
<i>hasn't been even high.</i>

766
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,649
I think because...

767
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:08,695
Sometimes with anxiety, knowing that
something might eventually get done,

768
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,655
even though it's not done yet, is nice,

769
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,199
versus "It's never gonna get done.
I have no idea."

770
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,702
Jaxon, do you like this one? Yes or no.

771
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,620
-Uh, yes!
-Yay!

772
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:18,621
Good job.

773
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,789
How about this?

774
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,458
-You like it?
-Yes.

775
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,960
Are you sure? You took a second.

776
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,253
-You like this?
-[Jaxon] Yeah.

777
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,338
-[Rachel] Okay.
-Do you like this one?

778
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,798
No, do <i>you </i>like this one?

779
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,300
[Rachel] So this is my makeup drawer.

780
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,428
We've kind of already separated a few.

781
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,097
I've set Ryan up over here
to do some makeup.

782
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,348
Can I have a towel, Mom?

783
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,559
-[Rachel] You need a towel?
-Yeah.

784
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,185
[Rachel] Let me see what you did.

785
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,856
Oh, you look so pretty.

786
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:46,858
[Kevin] As you can see,

787
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,736
we're kind of like
in the middle of everything.

788
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,572
All these bags are all the clothes.

789
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,742
I think there's also one bag of toys.

790
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,952
All this is gonna be gone.

791
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,830
And hopefully this place
is gonna be cleared out

792
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,540
and look a hell of a lot better.

793
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,500
[in Japanese] While you are tidying,

794
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:09,297
it may seem like things are
more cluttered  than before.

795
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,465
But there's no need to worry.

796
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,717
By following the process step by step,

797
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,094
there will always be an end
to tidying.

798
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,308
[birds chirping]

799
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,648
[knocking]

800
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:30,943
[squealing]

801
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,570
Marie, yay!

802
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,489
-Good to see you.
-I'm so happy you're here!

803
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,908
-Good to see you, Rachel.
-Nice to see you guys.

804
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,951
Oh, my gosh.

805
00:34:39,034 --> 00:34:40,786
-I was waiting for this day.
-[Marie chuckles]

806
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,331
[Rachel] Can I tell you, Marie,
like, during this process,

807
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,792
I'm already feeling good, like,
waking up already.

808
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,377
And I'm freaking tired.
I'm tired, but I still feel good.

809
00:34:48,835 --> 00:34:51,089
Even with Kevin and I, like,
things have changed with us.

810
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:54,759
Like, he has been more romantic
and cute lately.

811
00:34:55,217 --> 00:34:57,845
He says, "Oh, the whole cleaning thing
is, like, sexy."

812
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,306
So it's just, you know-- I'm serious!

813
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,642
[speaking Japanese]

814
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,938
[Iida] That is a very American way
of looking at it.

815
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,565
-I love it. I love it so much.
-It really is.

816
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,485
It really is. So thank you. I'm excited.

817
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,112
[in English] I'm so glad to hear that.

818
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,780
[Rachel] Yes, thank you!

819
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:19,242
So in terms of where things go, I know
you'll help us eventually with that,

820
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,036
but we did the best that we can.
Again, if there's a better place...

821
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,913
[in Japanese] This is good.

822
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:24,831
I did everything.

823
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,208
I was like, okay, I discarded,
now tell me where it goes.

824
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,753
[speaking Japanese]

825
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,256
[Iida] But it's-- It's nearly perfect.

826
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,715
[Rachel] No, I appreciate that.

827
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:38,094
I feel like I don't know the best way
to store it, so I'm gonna--

828
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,929
You have to give me, like, your tips.

829
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,014
[speaking Japanese]

830
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,350
[Iida] My advice for storage

831
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:48,020
is try to keep things of the same sizes
together in the same place.

832
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,147
[Rachel] Right, I see that.

833
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,193
[Iida] Another advice I have for storing
is utilize tiny boxes in here.

834
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,529
It's easier to place back.

835
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,364
[Rachel] Yes, they have a spot.

836
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,199
[Iida] To have a home for everything.

837
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,619
Hello, hello.

838
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,996
-[Rachel] Hi, babe.
-I'm home.

839
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,123
-[Marie] Hi! Good to see you!
-Hi, how are you, Marie?

840
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,416
Good to see you.

841
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,002
There's been some good stuff
going on in here.

842
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,087
I'm excited, I wanna hear.
Let me put this down.

843
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,548
-Oh.
-What, what, what? Oh.

844
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,550
-Oh, I'm sorry, you too, you too.
-No, babe, babe.

845
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,844
I'm saying there's been some
good stuff going on in here.

846
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,388
[peaceful music playing]

847
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:29,103
[in Japanese] Rachel and Kevin have a
strong grasp of what it means to spark joy

848
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,354
So with that,

849
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:33,482
we're moving on to the final category,
sentimental items.

850
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,777
[Marie] <i>Sentimental items have</i>
<i>many categories.</i>

851
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:40,865
<i>For example, memorabilia,</i>
<i>such as old letters or photos.</i>

852
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:45,703
[in Japanese] Let's take
the sentimental things into the house.

853
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,414
-[Kevin] Okay, babe.
-[Rachel] Okay.

854
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:53,878
[in Japanese] That reminds me, I wanted to
tell you one more thing about storage.

855
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,004
[Rachel] Okay.

856
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,881
[Marie speaking Japanese]

857
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,592
-These smaller items...
-I know.

858
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,802
[Marie speaking Japanese]

859
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,471
[Marie squealing]

860
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,598
-[Rachel] No, Marie!
-[Marie laughing]

861
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,726
[speaking Japanese]

862
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,270
[Iida] Remember how I said
we often store everything

863
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,272
-in a way that we can't see it?
-[Rachel] Yes.

864
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,025
[Iida] So that you end up buying
the same thing over and over again.

865
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,860
[Rachel] Yeah, I do it all the time, yes.

866
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:21,155
[Marie, in Japanese] So, you put it
in there, so that it's easy to see.

867
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,783
[Iida] So make sure
that when you open anything,

868
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:28,079
it's readily apparent what you have
and how many you have.

869
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,831
[Rachel] I love that. Thank you.

870
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:32,792
[Kevin] Hey, babe.

871
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,294
I'm just going through pictures right now.

872
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,088
-[Rachel] Yeah?
-[Kevin] Come here, help me.

873
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,467
-Oh, I forgot about these.
-[Marie gasps]

874
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,345
-[Marie] Oh, wow!
-I know, these are our wedding things.

875
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,432
We have to put them in different frames.

876
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:53,312
[Kevin] We had such a fun wedding
and, uh, her sisters and my brothers

877
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,357
gave the best speeches at our wedding.

878
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,859
And so they're all, like, here.

879
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,695
We have to set a reminder
to look at frames.

880
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,988
[speaking Japanese]

881
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,448
-[Iida] She loves how you two are.
-[Kevin laughing]

882
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,285
[Rachel] You guys are reminding us
what we started with.

883
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,161
We get lost in the moment. Yeah.

884
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,247
[Kevin] Babe, you were super hot
on our wedding day.

885
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,332
-[Rachel] What about now, babe?
-[Kevin] What's that [stammers]?

886
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,417
And every day since.

887
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,626
[Rachel] Okay, thank you.

888
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,673
[car engine idling]

889
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,513
-[Rachel] You wanna start with the bins?
-[Kevin] Yeah, I'll pull 'em out.

890
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,307
[Rachel] Who's in that picture?
Who's this?

891
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,224
[Ryan] <i>Mémé.</i>

892
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,351
[Rachel] Yeah, we gotta give
these pictures to <i>Mémé.</i>

893
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,521
-I want the-- [yelling]
-[Rachel] Oh, my God.

894
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,356
Yeah. If you wanna look,
you gotta sit here.

895
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,318
Babe, I don't remember the last time
I looked through these pictures.

896
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,696
[Rachel] We should finally put
some wedding pictures up

897
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,614
so people don't think
that we're just roommates.

898
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,949
[laughing]

899
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,702
-Hey, whatever you want to do, I'm in.
-No, I'm serious.

900
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,580
That way when we get mad at each other
we look up and see our picture

901
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,249
and we're like, "Oh, it's you,
this is why we're doing this."

902
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,126
[Rachel] <i>I love how Kevin and I are.</i>

903
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,546
<i>I've noticed a difference in him,</i>
<i>even just his demeanor.</i>

904
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:04,216
We haven't been nitpicking on each other
and actually have been enjoying our time.

905
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,135
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah?

906
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,304
I'll never forget your
flavor saver when I met you.

907
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,348
-Oh, man.
-I wanna see that for one sec.

908
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,100
-That's how I got you.
-Babe, but your bleached hair?

909
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,519
[Rachel] <i>It's almost like another bonus</i>
<i>from her method</i>

910
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,938
<i>as opposed to the house just</i>
<i>looking nice and feeling good,</i>

911
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,607
<i>Kevin and I's relationship,</i>

912
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,192
<i>is just in a different place.</i>

913
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,027
<i>And my kids...</i>

914
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,613
<i>maybe because they've been</i>
<i>seeing us do it more often.</i>

915
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,406
<i>We were  folding the other day</i>

916
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,493
and, like, Ryan was doing things
where she was patting the clothes.

917
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,620
<i>Like, she's already noticing these things.</i>

918
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,872
<i>So I feel like the more that we do it,</i>

919
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,208
<i>that habit is going to be put into them.</i>

920
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,085
So I'm just, like, excited. I don't know.

921
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,961
Literally, if you felt my chest right now,

922
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,089
it's like my heart's beating
'cause I'm excited.

923
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,300
I love that we had our date night
the other night.

924
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,218
[Kevin chuckles]

925
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,136
Even though you were tired
thanks for going out.

926
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,847
It was easy, there wasn't
anything else to do. It was nice.

927
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,307
Times that you, like, do the dishes

928
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,976
and I come home or wake up
and the whole kitchen's clean,

929
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,604
like, I love that feeling,
so, thanks for doing the dishes.

930
00:39:58,938 --> 00:39:59,772
[Kevin] Yep.

931
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,024
Rachel and I are...

932
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,820
[sighs] It's like it gives me the, uh,
chills a little bit.

933
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,696
It's like we're, like, happier.

934
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,240
We're more at ease.

935
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,574
There's less--

936
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,410
Like, there's less tension.

937
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,786
When we're doing...

938
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,747
things in the kitchen
or we're doing the laundry,

939
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:20,126
we're talking, we're having a conversation
about our day and et cetera.

940
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,462
And it's-- It's not something
that takes away

941
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,256
from our life anymore.

942
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,216
It's something that adds to our life now.

943
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,259
[Ryan] Hi, Daddy!

944
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,427
Hi, honey.

945
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,637
-Imma give you kisses now!
-Okay!

946
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,015
-[Kevin laughing]
-I love you, Daddy!

947
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,059
[Ryan] You're so pretty!

948
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,477
You're so pretty!

949
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,604
You're so cute! I love you!

950
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,565
You're so cute. I love you, too.

951
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,650
[laughing]

952
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,236
She's next level, man. I don't know.

953
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,196
We can't figure out
where the hell she came from.

954
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,239
[Ryan] Daddy!

955
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,491
[birds chirping]

956
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,954
I really want to do this
for my mom and my aunt.

957
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,247
-[knocking]
-Oh, my God.

958
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,166
Open and see. Want me to hold you?

959
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,500
-Yeah.
-Okay. Ready?

960
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,586
-Who's here, Dad?
-Okay, let's see.

961
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:07,173
-[all] Hi!
-Oh, my goodness, who is it?

962
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,592
-How are you? Oh my gosh, come in.
-[Marie] Good!

963
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:12,219
-Hi, Marie.
-How are you guys? Come in and sit.

964
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,014
[Rachel] I feel like now you can enjoy
and sit in my home.

965
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,557
[Iida speaking Japanese]

966
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,766
Yeah, have a seat.

967
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,393
[in Japanese] Please sit here.

968
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,479
[Marie, in Japanese] Thank you.

969
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,772
[Marie speaking Japanese]

970
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:26,650
[Iida] The vibe is completely different
from the first day I came.

971
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,611
Oh, my God. We feel it, too.

972
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,906
[in Japanese]
You said you are doing your own laundry

973
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,617
but how often does your helper come?

974
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,868
[Rachel] I sent her a message.

975
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,204
You know, "We're going through
a process right now and...

976
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:42,374
we're trying to learn to fold our laundry,
so I don't think I'll be using you."

977
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,628
She said, "I'm so happy that you found
something that works for you.

978
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,172
That's all I could ever--"
She was actually happy for me.

979
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,674
-[in Japanese] I'm so happy to hear that

980
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,093
We're excited to show you some stuff, too.

981
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,012
[speaking Japanese]

982
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,972
-[Iida] Yeah, I can't wait!
-[Marie laughs]

983
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,727
[in Japanese] Wow, it's so different.

984
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,686
[Iida] Wow.

985
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,772
[peaceful music playing]

986
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,444
[Rachel] <i>I've never felt as good</i>
<i>about something</i>

987
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,863
<i>in terms of, like, organizing as I do now.</i>

988
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:24,166
<i>I can honestly say that I'm really proud</i>
<i>of what we've accomplished with the house</i>

989
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,335
<i>in such a short period of time.</i>

990
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,591
-[Rachel] We're good?
-[Marie speaking Japanese]

991
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,802
I'm so satisfied. This is fantastic.

992
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:35,886
[Rachel] Oh, my God, good!

993
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:40,057
[Rachel] <i>I can't get my day started now</i>
<i>until I make my bed.</i>

994
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,811
-[Kevin] <i>She's been making it every day.</i>
<i>-</i>[Marie] <i>Every day?</i>

995
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,315
[Rachel] <i>I don't let myself get lazy.</i>

996
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,901
<i>I wanna do it because</i>
<i>I wanna keep this feeling going.</i>

997
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:54,280
<i>So, thank you to you</i>
<i>for inspiring us to do that.</i>

998
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,494
<i>I didn't realize the importance</i>
<i>of everything having a home.</i>

999
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,416
[Marie speaking Japanese]

1000
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,751
[Iida] <i>I can see that your lifestyle</i>
<i>itself has changed.</i>

1001
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,169
-[Rachel] It's crazy.
-[chuckling]

1002
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,046
[Kevin] <i>How's the folding?</i>

1003
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:14,091
-[Marie] <i>Great.</i>
-[Rachel]<i> Really? Good, I'm so excited.</i>

1004
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,803
[in Japanese]
I can feel the spirit of this bedroom.

1005
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:18,929
[Rachel] I'm so happy.

1006
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,474
[Rachel]
<i>Okay, let's show you the kids' room.</i>

1007
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,021
[Marie, in Japanese]
<i>Everything you have is so cute.</i>

1008
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,647
[Rachel] <i>Ooh! Thank you!</i>

1009
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:32,693
<i>We like this room.</i>

1010
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,695
<i>It's been easy to find stuff</i>
<i>for the kids.</i>

1011
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,405
-[Marie] <i>Perfect.</i>
-[Rachel] <i>Perfect?</i>

1012
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,365
[Marie] <i>Amazing!</i>

1013
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,244
[Marie, in Japanese]
<i>It's like a whole different closet.</i>

1014
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:45,372
[Rachel] I feel like we have
the kitchen now. Go ahead.

1015
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,251
[Kevin] <i>This room looks...</i>

1016
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,378
<i>completely different.</i>

1017
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,464
[Rachel]
<i>I just never felt at ease in here.</i>

1018
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:55,674
<i>And now, like, it feels really good.</i>

1019
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,803
[Ryan] Who's that?

1020
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:02,765
[Marie, in Japanese]
<i>It feels so different in here.</i>

1021
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,810
[Rachel] <i>Opening the drawers, too,</i>
<i>is so nice.</i>

1022
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,062
<i>We know where everything goes.</i>

1023
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,564
<i>We experienced doing the house,</i>

1024
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,441
<i>but it's just so bright in here</i>
<i>and so clean,</i>

1025
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:13,734
<i>it's like-- </i>[gasping]

1026
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,070
[Marie, in Japanese]
<i>This is complete.</i>

1027
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,114
-And finally the garage.
-And the garage?

1028
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,909
-[Rachel] Kevin's going to show you.
-Garage, let's do it.

1029
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,619
-[Rachel] Okay.
-[Kevin] Let's do it.

1030
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:26,789
[Rachel] <i>Kevin's excited about the garage.</i>
<i>He worked hard on this.</i>

1031
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,084
<i>Doesn't it even look different in here?</i>

1032
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,961
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] It's completely different.

1033
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,296
-Trust me.
-Oh, my gosh.

1034
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,966
[Marie, in Japanese]
<i>Everything is separated by category.</i>

1035
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,678
-[Iida] <i>This is a dramatic change.</i>
-[Kevin]<i> Good, thank you.</i>

1036
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,557
[Marie, in Japanese]
<i>I like the feeling in this space.</i>

1037
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:46,850
[Kevin] <i>I do, too.</i>

1038
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:50,562
[in Japanese] Both you, Rachel and Kevin,

1039
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:54,274
<i>you worked on your entire house this time.</i>

1040
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,235
<i>You had quite the experience.</i>

1041
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,945
Thank you. It was a lot of work,

1042
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,447
but it was motivating
knowing what the end was gonna be.

1043
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,491
-[speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] And you finished.

1044
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,034
Yeah, which is crazy.

1045
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:06,245
-With two young kids, it's crazy.
-Yeah.

1046
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,664
[in Japanese] I'm so happy.

1047
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,041
I like you the most!

1048
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,001
-[Marie squeals]
-[in Japanese] I'm so happy!

1049
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,253
[laughing]

1050
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:17,131
[Rachel] <i>Marie, she changed my life.</i>

1051
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,842
<i>It's just insane how, like,</i>
<i>my mentality has changed.</i>

1052
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,386
There's a sense of, like,
relaxation and...

1053
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,513
just doing all the things we need to do.

1054
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:27,558
[Kevin] <i>If it's laundry, okay, we do it.</i>
<i>If there's dishes, we just do it.</i>

1055
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,184
Show me how you fold it.

1056
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,519
I folded!

1057
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,272
Even if things do pile up,
it's like, "Nope, we got this."

1058
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,858
There's no... [gasping]
"Oh, my gosh, I'm never gonna get to it."

1059
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,360
The sense of calm,
like, "I could totally do this."

1060
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,070
[Jaxon giggling]

1061
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:43,699
[Kevin] <i>There is more time to just</i>
<i>hang with the kids,</i>

1062
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,909
<i>especially for me,</i>
<i>when I come home from work.</i>

1063
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,203
Is this okay that daddy kisses me?

1064
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,956
[Ryan giggles]
Daddy, do the big one kiss.

1065
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,750
Oh, do the big one kiss? Okay.

1066
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,210
[Kevin] We're really happy
and we're just looking forward

1067
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,963
to living this way for... for the rest
of our lives, hopefully.

1068
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,215
-Yeah.
-It's, It's great, it's been amazing.

1069
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,926
These are, like, happy, happy tears.

1070
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:06,889
But I'm actually sad you're going,
but I'm happy because of your method.

1071
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,057
We actually get to, like, enjoy the home.

1072
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,393
Thank you for showing us
that, like, we could do it,

1073
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,353
and that we just needed
a little bit of help.

1074
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,273
[in Japanese] I feel your happiness
and it makes me happy.

1075
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,441
Thank you.

1076
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,735
Thank you for what
you've brought to our home, really.

1077
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:24,281
[in Japanese] Through this process
of tidying with Rachel and Kevin,

1078
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,908
I reaffirmed my feelings,

1079
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:31,121
that indeed, couples can deepen their ties
through tidying.

1080
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:36,043
I hope that each day for the Friend family
will continue to spark joy.

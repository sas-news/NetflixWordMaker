-Ah!
-[woman] She looks excited!

2
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:11,052
I'm so excited because I love mess.

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:14,347
[man] It's a never ending battle
to fight the clutter.

4
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,349
-[knocking]
-Oh!

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,019
I want things to be more simple.
I don't know how to fix it.

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,438
With the baby coming,
it's gonna be more chaos.

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,314
[gasping, squealing]

8
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,567
[man] Oh, my God! We have too much stuff!

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,028
Hello, I'm Marie Kondo.

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,279
[in Japanese] My mission

11
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,741
is to spark joy in the world
through cleaning.

12
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:33,950
Ching!

13
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,995
[narrator] <i>Best-selling author</i>
<i>and world-renowned tidying expert</i>

14
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:41,583
<i>Marie Kondo is dedicated to inspiring</i>
<i>the world to choose joy</i>

15
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,334
<i>with the KonMari Method.</i>

16
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,253
[in Japanese]
A feature of the KonMari Method

17
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:48,214
<i>is that you clean by item</i>
<i>and not by location.</i>

18
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,718
And we will always clean using
the same categories.

19
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,386
[in English] First, it's clothing.

20
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,096
-[Marie grunting]
-[laughter]

21
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,264
I can't reach.

22
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,849
Next, is books.

23
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,852
[Iida] Giving them a little shake
and wake them up.

24
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,479
Then, paper.

25
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,438
[man sighs] I can't do the papers.

26
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,690
[deep groan]

27
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,027
The largest category is <i>komono.</i>

28
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,614
<i>Komono </i>is kitchen, bathroom,

29
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,740
and garage.

30
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,868
Everything miscellaneous.

31
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,163
Finally, sentimental items.

32
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,999
It's kinda hard to let it go,
'cause I really like this one.

33
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,212
[sniffling] This is kinda hard.

34
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:30,131
I don't want to just, you know, dump it.

35
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,093
But I want to be thoughtful about it.

36
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,554
[man 2] <i>From the moment she</i>
<i>set foot in our house,</i>

37
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,473
<i>she had this presence to her.</i>

38
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,767
She wants to see this place turned around.

39
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,895
Marie brought a whole bunch
of joy upon our home.

40
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,313
This is amazing.

41
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,440
[girl] You're so cute! I love you!

42
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,734
You're so cute.
I love you, too. [laughing]

43
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,028
These are, like, happy, happy tears.

44
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,197
Thank you for what you've brought
to our home, really.

[in Japanese] The KonMari Method
is a means to realize your ideal life.

46
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,961
My clients this time, Angela and Alishia,
are newlyweds.

47
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:12,632
They recently purchased a condo
for their new home.

48
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,676
They are a lovely couple,

49
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:19,305
but they are having trouble figuring out
how they can turn their new home

50
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,307
into a comfortable space for both of them.

51
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,981
Through tidying, I'm looking forward to
helping them create a comfortable home.

53
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,538

-Yes!

-Alright, come on in.
-Thank you.

59
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,345
[Angela] We do have a kitty cat.

-Hi. [laughing]

62
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,185
[in Japanese] Hi, Kitty!

63

-Nice to meet you. I'm Marie.
-[chuckles] Alishia.

64

67
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,030
-[Iida] Oh, you have two dogs!
-Our puppies out there.

68
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,991
[Angela] So the big one is London
and the little one is Teddy,

69
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,202
and you've met kitten, Earl.

70
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,332
I'm Angela, I'm a veterinarian.

71
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,584
I'm Alishia, I'm a flight attendant.

72
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,253
I was working a flight from...

73
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:33,755
Vegas to Atlanta,

74
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,466
and she was my passenger and she was all
like, "Hey, cute stuff."

75
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,093
-I was like, "Hey, girl."
-That's not how I remember it.

76
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,804
Oh, my gosh, really?
I mean, it's close enough.

77
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,973
-That was, what, five years ago?
-Mm-hmm.

78
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,851
[Alishia] <i>Prior to Angela</i>
<i>I was considered a nomad.</i>

79
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,103
<i>I feel like I literally grabbed her</i>
<i>out of the sky and...</i>

80
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,855
brought her down to earth.

81
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,106
Oh, yes.

82
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,360
[Angela]
<i>We recently just got married last June.</i>

83
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,655
<i>-We've literally married...</i>
<i>-</i>[Alishia] <i>Married our lives together.</i>

84
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,907
So, we are new homeowners.

85
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,494
About a month ago,
we've closed escrow on our new place.

86
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:08,706
So, this is that first step
into adulthood that we're--

87
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,334
we've heard so much about. [laughing]

88

[Angela]
<i>Just in these last couple of weeks,</i>

89
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,255

<i>and things are everywhere.</i>

90
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,341
[Alishia]
<i>The transition has been semi-stressful.</i>

91
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,052
-You know, it's--
-Very stressful.

92
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,845
Okay. Very stressful.

93
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:27,392
[Alishia] <i>That's why it's critical</i>
<i>for us to get our space</i>

95
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,729
<i>because it's a new chapter.</i>

96
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,439
You don't want to start
the new chapter...

97
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,401
-disorganized or chaotic.
-With old stuff.

98
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,111
We want that easy breezy.

99
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:41,197
We want to be able to come into our space
and definitely feel...

100
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,574
relaxed, you know?

101
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,243
[speaking Japanese]

102
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,497
[Iida] So how long has it been
since you moved here?

103
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,957
Uh, It's only been three weeks.

104
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,333
-We just moved here.
-Three weeks?

105
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,251
[Angela] Yes.

107
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,796
-Gosh, so you just moved in.
-Yes.

108
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,631
-[Iida] Wow.
-[speaking Japanese]

109
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,842
[Iida] So, as soon as I entered this room,

110
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,052
it seems perfectly organized and tidy.

111
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,680
Is, is--
Do you really have a problem with tidying?

112
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,016
-Oh, you'll see.
-Should we give you a little tour?

113
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,225
[in Japanese] Yes, please.

-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-♪ <i>The struggle ♪</i>

115
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,147

-[Iida] I see. I'm starting to see now.
-[Alishia] The good stuff. Yeah.

117
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,819
Ninety percent of those are mine.

118
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,154
[Iida translating]

119
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,865
[Alishia] Those are mostly mine.

120
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,992
[in Japanese] Here are the shoes.

121
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,744
-Clothes.
-[Marie, in English] Clothes.

122
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,830
-Mostly mine. Well...
-[Iida translating]

123
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,124
Mine. Mine, mine.

124
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,084
Ours, more winter stuff.

125
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,671
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-So how do you use this room right now?

126
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,964
-We don't.
-[Angela laughing]

127
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,091
We want this room to be
kinda like the office

128
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,345
slash guest space, slash closet.

129
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,055
[Marie speaking Japanese]

130
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,892
[Iida] Yes, there's a lot of cloudiness
here in this room.

131
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,019
So we'll figure that out.

132
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,188
-[Alishia] Don't fall on anything.
-[all laughing]

133
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,940
[Angela] We tried to organize
this space a little bit.

134
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,069
[speaking Japanese]

135
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,695
[Iida] So how do you use this space?

136
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,573
My pants and then...

137
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,659
-Those are my jeans on that side.
-Yeah.

138
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:14,040
[Alishia] <i>Usually, we find ourselves</i>
<i>in a closet battle.</i>

139
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:18,419
For instance, we share belts, like belts
and socks and accessories and things.

140
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,421
I'll ask her where the belts are,

141
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,673
'cause my belts that she doesn't wear
are in a spot,

142
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,093
so we have, like, separate belts
and we have belts together.

143
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,220
-[Alishis chuckles]
-The belts together get lost.

144
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,348
[Alishia] <i>Although we've been together</i>
<i>for so many years,</i>

145
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,183
<i>we never got to organize.</i>

146
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,520
We're gonna have clothes in both rooms.

147
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,730
You wanna put your shirt on over there,
pants over here.

148
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,940
How do you want this to work?

149
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,901
I've kinda just been grabbing
the outfit together.

150
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,904
Like, I grab a shirt, come in here
and grab some pants,

151
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,948
and get dressed in the room.

152
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,951
-I'm just saying, you don't want...
-Some cohesiveness?

153
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,702
-Yeah.
-I do, but I just...

154
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,830
I just want everything put away right now.

155
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,123
[both laughing]

156
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,041
-It causes tension.
-It causes tension.

00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,294
[speaking Japanese]

158
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,256
[Iida] So the general impression
that I got from your closet is that

159
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,591
a lot of your things are mixed together

160
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:09,512
and it's a little difficult
to determine, oh, what's inside.

161
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,264
-Yeah.
-Yes.

162
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,348
Yes.

163
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,523
[in Japanese] A tip on sharing
closet space with a partner

164
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:24,444
is to designate areas for each person.

165
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,945
For example,

166
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,613
in this closet...

167
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,906
[grunting]

168
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,159
I can't reach the top rack,

169
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:36,372
so I will choose to use the bottom rack.

170
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,040
By doing this,

171
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:44,839
it is easy to see
how much clothing you have.

172
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,008
[Marie] Aw.

173
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,135
[Angela] This is kind of
our stress-free area.

174
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,012
We wanted to ensure we had
a place in the house

175
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:55,183
to kinda get away from all of the moving,
and so we put this together first.

176
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,143
[Alishia] Okay. [grunting]

177
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:58,853
You got it?

178
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,856
So this is the only part
where it's kind of like hers and mine.

179
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,524
[Alishia] Yeah, clothes are mine.

180
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,444
I feel like we organize things
a little differently,

181
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,571
like, she will put things
in a different spot than me,

182
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,741
and I think that's how we get
kind of our wires crossed.

183
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,576
[Marie speaking Japanese]

184
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:17,038
[Iida] I would recommend making
this particular closet

185
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,164
all of Alishia's clothes.

186
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,834
[Alishia] And then that way Angela
could have the guest bedroom space.

187
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,795
[Marie speaking Japanese]

188
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,132
[Iida] Ultimately, that would be
the simplest solution.

189
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,342
-[tsks] Goody.
-Okay.

190
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:35,556
[in Japanese] When tidying,
each individual should be responsible

191
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,350
for their own space.

192
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:42,230
This lessens the tension

193
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,690
and increases their sense of trust
and bonding.

194
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,109
[Angela] The kitchen. It could be better.

195
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,031
[Iida] This has room
for improvement definitely.

196
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,658
[Angela] That's actually a problem area.

197
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,826
[Iida] So do these items belong
to the both of you,

198
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,037
or does one person
have more than the other?

199
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,288
I would say maybe both.

200
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,790
The kitchen was kinda split.

201
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,792
-Yeah.
-Half is mine, half is hers.

202
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,294
We're definitely complete opposites

203
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,421
when it comes to, like, organizing.

204
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,006
[Angela] And it's frustrating.

205
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,593
We need help categorizing what stuff
needs to go with what stuff.

206
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:13,803
[speaking Japanese]

207
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,181
[Iida] I really feel that the presence
of this home is so important.

208
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,934
You mentioned that this is your first home
that you've purchased,

209
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,186
so this is a very significant space.

210
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,272
So I would like to take this time

211
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,441
to formally introduce myself to your home.

212
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,734
-Okay.
-Okay.

213
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,403
[speaking Japanese]

214
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,530
[Iida] It's only been three weeks, right?

215
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,489
-Yup.
-Yes.

216
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,534
[speaking Japanese]

217
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,202
If that's the case,

218
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,581
I think it would be much better
if you do this with me.

219
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,374
-Okay.
-Okay, let's do it.

220
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,459
[Iida] Let's gather here in the middle.

221
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,920
[speaking Japanese]

222
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,343
[Iida] Just tell your home
your intention for it

223
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,345
and your hopes for it.

224
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,974
[peaceful music playing]

225
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,841
[playful music playing]

226
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,691
She'll meditate for a while.

227
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,068
[Angela chuckling]

228
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,402
You guys left me.

229
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,570
[laughing]

230
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,115
[speaking Japanese]

231
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,367
[Iida] How did you feel?

232
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,243
-Inspired.
-[Iida translating]

233
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,328
Excited.

234
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,705
-[Alishia] Yeah.
-[Angela] I just saw order.

235
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,082
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

236
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,458
Relaxed.

237
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,629
[Iida] I hope you'll keep
all the feelings that you felt

238
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,506
in your heart
as we go through the tidying,

239
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,133
because tidying isn't just about
organizing your home.

240
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:21,263
It's about creating a welcoming, inviting,
positive environment into your home.

241
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,265
Yay!

242
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,814
[Iida] Take out every single,
last piece of clothes.

243
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,191
Oh, lordy, help me!

244
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,359
[chuckling]

245
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,654
-What's your anxiety level right now?
-[laughing]

246
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,240
[Angela]
We're gonna lose Marie in the pile.

247
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,242
[Alishia] Holy macaroni.

248
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,369
[Angela] I told you you have
more clothes than me.

249
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,287
[Alishia]
I know I have more clothes than you.

250
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,331
[Angela] I think we have it all.

251
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,918
[Iida] We're gonna be going through
these clothes piece be piece.

252
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,795
When you hold each item in your hands,

253
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,381
ask if it sparks joy for you.

254
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,425
Okay. I can do that.

255
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,385
We can just start right from the top.

256
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,470
Yes.

257
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,013
Yes, yes.

258
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,390
Yes, yes, yes.

259
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,476
And all of these yeses. [laughing]

260
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,771
[speaking Japanese]

261
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,357
[Iida] Angela, let's get started
with your pile, then.

262
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,984
-Okay.
-Oh, Okay.

263
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,236
[Angela] <i>Clothes for me</i>
<i>are just functional</i>

264
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,281
<i>because I'm not very attached</i>
<i>to material things.</i>

265
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,533
So I don't have very
many clothes in general

266
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,327
just because I'm wearing scrubs
four days out of the week.

267
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,914
I don't have dresses and shirts
and pants and stuff like that.

268
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,666
I don't like to get dressed up too much.

269
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,334
[speaking Japanese]

270
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,045
[Iida] Ask if it sparks joy for you.

271
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,132
I like it, but I really--
I don't wear it as often.

272
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,802
I can let you go.
You can be happy for somebody else.

273
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,596
-[Marie] Thank you.
-[Angela] Thank you.

274
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,847
She let the Redskins go?

275
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,766
Get out of my space!

276
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,768
-[laughing]
-[Marie speaking Japanese]

277
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,769
Goodness.

278
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:56,358
[Alishia] I pride myself
on my eclecticness

279
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,943
because I do wear a uniform,

280
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,780
and so, I don't really get to wear
my clothes too much,

281
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,948
and I feel like
even though I'm not wearing

282
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,158
the clothes all the time

283
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,578
it's still, like, an expression
of my personality.

284
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,330
Right, how are we doing?

285
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,458
[Alishia] Question: there's some things
that I'm holding onto.

286
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,044
There's one dress in particular
I wanted to show you.

287
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,130
This is actually the little dress.
My grandmother bought me this.

288
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,089
Ah! I love.

289
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,090
[Iida translating]

290
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,760
Isn't it so cute?

291
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,846
-[speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] I love it, it's lovely.

292
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,681
But it's also too small, so...

293
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,141
[Iida translating]

294
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,392
I just remember...

295
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,147
wanting it really bad,
and she kinda gave me that look.

296
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,565
She was like, "Go try it on."

297
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,235
So I go try it on and she goes,
"Okay, you can have it."

298
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,362
[Iida] Are you very close
to your grandmother?

299
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:44,824
I was, she passed away in 2006.

300
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,158
This is probably, like...

301
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,161
close to the oldest thing in my closet.

302
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,496
[speaking Japanese]

303
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:54,250
[Iida] The point of this process isn't
to force yourself to eliminate things.

304
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:58,879
It's really to confirm how you feel about
each and every item that you possess.

305
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,130
[inhaling sharply]

306
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,634
I'm just gonna look at you
a little longer.

307
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,387
Just a little longer.

308
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:12,268
Marie helping us tackle the biggest
challenge, which is our closet space

309
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,729
and the actual organization
is so refreshing.

310
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,190
I'm excited to put everything
where it needs to be.

311
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,901
-Bye, see you soon.
-See you soon. Bye.

312
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,989
Okay, you ready to get this homework done?

313
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,286
Where do I put my keep stuff?

314
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,831
[Alishia] <i>I love my clothes.</i>

315
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,876
I know when it touches my body,
I'm like, "Ooh!" I get it.

316
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,963
I get it. So that, that feeling
that she said that you should feel,

317
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,173
that is-- that's joy.

318
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,676
I feel that with a lot of my items.

319
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,928
For instance, this particular dress,

320
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,181
I was probably 16 or 17
when my grandmother purchased it.

321
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:55,060
<i>But it was just that memory</i>
<i>of being with her.</i>

322
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,062
<i>And my grandmother loved clothes,</i>

323
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,106
<i>so we have that in common.</i>

324
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,482
So...

325
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,985
[sharp inhale and exhale]

326
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,738
It's kinda hard to let it go,
'cause I really like this one.

327
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:09,325
And I wear it all the time.
That's probably why it's faded, too.

328
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:10,826
But...

329
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,244
[pats and tsks]

330
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,748
This just takes me back
to a time with her and

331
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,875
not really-- I mean I spent
a lot of time with her,

332
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,461
but I just want it--
just I always remember--

333
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,297
[softly] I think I might cry now.

334
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,466
[gentle piano music playing]

335
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,470
[crying, sniffles]

336
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,516
[sniffling]

337
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,601
[Angela] You okay?

338
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:36,936
So you didn't just--

339
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,062
You okay?

340
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,439
-Aww...
-[Alishia sniffling]

341
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,732
It's okay.

342
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,575
[seagulls squawking]

343
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,371
-[doorbell chiming]
-[dogs barking]

344
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,623
-[Alishia] <i>Hi!</i>
<i>-</i>[Marie] <i>Hi!</i>

345
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,541
-How are you? Hi.
-Oh my goodness gracious.

346
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,378
[Angela] London, come on, let's go.
Let's go outside, honey.

347
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,463
Teddy, London, outside, let's go.

348
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,881
Go. Git.

349
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:07,716
There you go.

350
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,801
[Marie laughing]

351
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:09,885
[Marie speaking Japanese]

352
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,346
[Iida] How's it going?
How was the homework?

353
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:13,847
[Angela] Um...

354
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,934
-Well...
-[both laughing]

355
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:17,935
First things first,

356
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,021
these items are the things
that we've touched on

357
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,731
and loved on and thanked,

358
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,443
but they no longer serve
a purpose for us, so we're actually...

359
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,988
in the process of donating.

360
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,365
-[speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] That's great.

361
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,282
Okay.

362
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,576
-[in Japanese] I'd love to see the rest.
-Great. Okay.

363
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,579
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] I was wondering,

364
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,249
what did you do with the dress
that your grandmother gave you?

365
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,210
I still have it.
It's just next to the bed.

366
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,630
I knew I was gonna go through...

367
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,843
the changes in my mind and in my body,

368
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:55,431
especially with my clothes, because I do--
I love my clothes.

369
00:16:55,514 --> 00:17:00,227
But I have to learn to extract
the memory from an item.

370
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:04,772
That dress brings up my grandmother,
and I guess it's just more of a sad place

371
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,150
because she's no longer here.

372
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:10,154
I am gonna donate or give away or...

373
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,406
if anyone wants it. [laughing]

374
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,035
It's healthy to revisit and to remember,

375
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:19,413
and obviously I want a part
of my grandmother to be in my home,

376
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:23,751
but there are a lot of different things
that could remind me of her.

377
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:25,627
A question I had,

378
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,423
what is the best way to fold
the hoodies,

379
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,216
because they get so bulky

380
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,470
and I feel like it doesn't remain folded.

381
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,013
[speaking Japanese]

382
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:41,101
So there are two ways to store hoodies.

383
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,812
You can store them in drawers

384
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,731
or you can pile them together.

385
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,692
If you were storing them in drawers,

386
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,154
aim for that rectangle in the middle,

387
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,822
fold towards the center...

388
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,657
[speaking Japanese]

389
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,534
...tuck the hood in...

390
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,952
[speaking Japanese]

391
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,497
...and roll into thirds,

392
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,831
so you can file them vertically

393
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,000
-in the drawer if you like.
-[Alishia] Okay.

394
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,001
And then,

395
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,962
what is the best way
to fold undergarments?

396
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,048
[speaking Japanese]

397
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,509
[Iida] I consider bras
very important for women,

398
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,429
so I like to file them in a way
that really, truly sparks joy.

399
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:26,438
[in Japanese]
Bras are special items for women.

400
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,942
So let's store them with VIP treatment.

401
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,027
When storing bras,

402
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:36,990
arrange them in a way where
you don't smoosh the cups.

403
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,620
It'll spark joy if you arrange them
in a way that creates a color gradient.

404
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:47,459
Let's fold the cupless bras.

405
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,503
Fold it in half...

406
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,381
and tuck in the straps.

407
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,968
They can be stored in this way.

408
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,513
For soft cup bras.

409
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,182
Fold it in half,

410
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,144
tuck in the straps,

411
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,355
then roll it up

412
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,482
for a refreshing way to store it.

413
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,988
[in Japanese] When storing bras,

414
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:20,868
if you put them in boxes,
it'll look more organized.

415
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,039
Okay. Just a little quick peek.

416
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,082
[laughing]

417
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,001
[Marie speaking Japanese]

418
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,920
[Iida] And most importantly, shoes.

419
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,130
What happened to those?

420
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,631
[Alishia] The shoes are still mixed.

421
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,135
What we are trying to figure out
is if it'll be easier to leave

422
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,929
in the shoe box
or to take the shoes out.

423
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,222
[Marie speaking Japanese]

424
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,600
I will make this my homework
and think about it.

425
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,102
-[speaking Japanese]
-So okay, leave that up to me.

426
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,271
Don't worry too much
about the storage solution.

427
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,481
[speaking Japanese]

428
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,443
[Iida] So today I'd like to move
onto the miscellaneous items

429
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,987
and I recommend tackling the kitchen.

430
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,030
Okay.

431
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,828
[Marie speaking Japanese]

432
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,081
[Iida] Just take everything out,
even the tupperwares, everything out,

433
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,209
and just go through them and ask yourself

434
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:14,296
if you see any items
that don't belong to your life ahead,

435
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,423
that you don't necessarily feel
like it should be

436
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,258
a part of your life going forward.

437
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,885
Okay. Now...

438
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,347
Some spices.

439
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,682
Um, we have some pantry items.

440
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,434
[Marie] Oh, I see.

441
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,103
If there are any expired items,

442
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,272
this is a great opportunity
to toss them.

443
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,398
[Angela] Oh, for sure.

444
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:42,199
[in Japanese] The main tip on organizing
the pantry is to categorize food items.

445
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:46,036
For example, the drinks category
such as coffee and tea.

446
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,871
Cereals and snacks.

447
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,541
Pasta, flour, and other carbohydrates.

448
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,086
And finally canned foods.

449
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,213
For small items such as snacks,

450
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,633
if you put them in boxes
it'll be easier to access

451
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,260
and it'll look more organized.

452
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,761
By storing your food like this,

453
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:08,100
it will make it easy to keep track
of the quantity of food you have.

454
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,978
[Marie speaking Japanese]

455
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:14,606
[Iida] Next time I'm here, I will have
solutions for you in terms of storage

456
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,525
for all your miscellaneous items.

457
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,901
-See you next week.
-Next time.

458
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,569
Thank you guys. Bye bye.

459
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,740
-[Marie] Bye!
-[Alishia] Bye-bye.

460
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,118
Okay.

461
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,036
-We have more homework to do.
-More homework.

462
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,122
[Alishia] Oh, goodness. [sighs]

463
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,332
It's about to go down. [groans]

464
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,584
-Soy sauce.
-Soy.

465
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,087
This is disgusting. Throw it away.

466
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,422
[Angela] Why?

467
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,841
-Oh!
-Why, Alishia?

468
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,134
Don't why me.

469
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,845
We don't eat ketchup.
Is there ketchup in the refrigerator?

470
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,929
[Alishia chuckles]

471
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,681
Yes, there is.

472
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,891
You know what, ketchup?
You don't bring me joy anymore.

473
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,393
Oh, my gosh.

474
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,061
Uh-oh.

475
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,563
Don't even look.

476
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,565
[Alishia] What is that? Gravy?

477
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,275
[Angela] Turkey gravy, slow cooker.

478
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,192
There you go.

479
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:03,739
You've got turkey gravy from 2015!
[laughing]

480
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,282
[Angela laughing]

481
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:10,662
I feel like you've been holding onto
that turkey gravy just to be spiteful.

482
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:14,791
-We need to figure out...
-[Angela] Stop sliding that.

483
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,002
-Ugh...
-[Angela] Pick it up. Put it in the back.

484
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:17,919
I don't reach.

485
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,172
Oh, my goodness. Short people.

486
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:24,343
Angela and I have a disconnect
on where do we put these items.

487
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,928
Her access is different from my access.

488
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,473
Basic access is height.

489
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,058
[Angela] <i>We have a lot of cabinet space</i>

490
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,727
<i>where I can put stuff higher</i>
<i>and reach things,</i>

491
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,813
<i>but she does more of the cooking,</i>
<i>so it needs to be where she can reach it.</i>

492
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,523
Unless she doesn't want me to touch it.

493
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,233
And then I just put it really high.

494
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,651
Like my things.

495
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,236
[laughing]

496
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,072
"Don't touch my stuff, Alishia."

497
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,616
[Alishia]
Have you gone through these glasses?

498
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:48,658
[Angela] Yeah.

499
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,410
They don't look like you went through 'em.

500
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,662
Don't sort my things,
sort your things, 'kay?

501
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,624
Oh, those are fighting words!

502
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,502
"Don't sort my things, hmm hmm hmm."

503
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,586
Meow!

504
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,088
-[Angela] <i>We disagree on</i>

505
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,131
-[Alishia] <i>Organization.</i>
<i>-...where things should go</i>

506
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,966
<i>and how things should be done.</i>

507
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:09,179
If I had to give you an example of
what type of person I think Angela is,

508
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:11,807
she will put a blender...

509
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,642
in the linen closet.

510
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,061
Why is this here?

511
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,272
"Well, all the electronics are in there."

512
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,316
So in her mind it makes sense.

513
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,443
And then in mine I'm like, "No."

514
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,238
It made sense at the time and so I did it.
[sighs]

515
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,615
[Angela] You can get rid of those
pink ones.

516
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,409
[Alishia] What about these dirty
yellow ones?

517
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,785
You're sorting my stuff again.

518
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,663
Jesus, let go of it. Let go.

519
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,456
-[Angela] You are real judgy today.
-Well.

520
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,959
These are actually, like, seeing glasses.

521
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,502
These are not for style.

522
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,504
Why don't you just put them all in there?

523
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,841
You have a problem with wanting
to put things in different places.

524
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,969
One of the things that Marie
made very clear is that

525
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:52,806
even though you have different ideas,
like items need to be together here.

526
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:56,893
So once we sift through that
a little more,

527
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,272
with time, I think we'll be good.

528
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,820
[doorbell chiming]

529
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,115
-[Marie] Hi!
-[Alishia] Hello!

530
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,992
-Hi.
-Come on in.

531
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:15,370
-Come on in, welcome, welcome, welcome.
-Hi.

532
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,622
-Come on in.
-Nice to see you. Wow.

533
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,790
You guys brought gifts.

534
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,584
-[Iida translates]
-[Marie speaking Japanese]

535
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,877
Yes, many of them.

536
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,753
-[Alishia] Let's get right into it.
-Yeah.

537
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,089
-[Alishia] What's our next dilemma?
-[Angela] Shoes.

538
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,632
[Iida] When storing all these shoes,

539
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,343
try to imagine
what a store display would look like.

540
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:33,013
So just keep the similar colors together,

541
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,514
same types of shoes together.

542
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,517
-[Angela] So the shoe boxes.
-[Alishia] Can we keep the shoe boxes?

543
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,394
-Yeah. So like that, right?
-Right.

544
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,606
[Alishia] So we could just put the shoe
box here and then the shoes on top.

545
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,983
The only thing about this shelf...

546
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,568
are the heels.

547
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,528
[speaking Japanese]

548
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,947
[Iida] I actually have the same rack
in my closet, too

549
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,283
and that's always been my
problem that I have.

550
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,701
[Alishia] Oh, snap! Look at that!

551
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:59,331
[Iida] Even these you can fit
and it won't fall through.

552
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,373
Okay.

553
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,167
-Wow.
-[Iida laughing]

554
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,169
You solved that problem so fast.

555
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,462
[Iida] For me in my house,

556
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,924
I tend to use pretty postcards
or things that spark joy for me.

557
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,425
Oh, nice, okay.

558
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,010
I can do that.

559
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,638
-[Angela] What should we move onto now?
-[Marie speaking Japanese]

560
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,932
[Iida] I'd like to continue
with the lesson on <i>komono.</i>

561
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,183
Yes.

562
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,936
[Alishia] <i>So...</i>

563
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,271
<i>I don't know what to do</i>
<i>with our dog items</i>

564
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,565
<i>'cause they are in multiple places.</i>

565
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,691
[Iida] Let's take a look.

566
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,527
Oh, they're getting excited.

567
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,445
[Alishia] "That's my stuff!"

568
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,614
So we have three fur babies.

569
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,157
-Welcome to our family.
-Right.

570
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,827
[Angela] <i>Um, untraditional,</i>
<i>but traditional at the same time.</i>

571
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,246
<i>We're like the Brady Bunch.</i>

572
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,249
It was really important finding a space
that they could--

573
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,251
we could all co-habitate together.

574
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,253
Um, so the balconies are really nice

575
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,546
'cause they can go outside

576
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,589
on the balconies
and kinda get that airspace.

577
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,175
It's important that we get the space
together for them, too.

578
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,218
Oh, yes.

579
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,345
'Cause as you can see,
they're up in everything.

580
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,429
Oh, yes.

581
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,975
[Iida] So what's in here?
What's in this basket?

582
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:04,187
So, they have a lot of toys
and I want them to be able to get them.

583
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,064
But I also want the toys out the way.

584
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,400
I don't know how
she found all these balls.

585
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:13,780
Well, granted at our last place,
we lived next to a tennis court.

586
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,449
Can you select how many
tennis balls you need?

587
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,034
-One.
-Just one?

588
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,160
[dogs whimpering]

589
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,913
-[Angela] She wants her tennis balls.
-[all laughing]

590
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:26,293
I would say more than that because
sometimes at the park they get nasty

591
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,295
and we don't want to bring it home.

592
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,547
-[Iida] Two?
-[Alishia] Three. Mhm.

593
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,257
-[Angela] Three tennis balls.
-Three, okay.

594
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,384
[speaking Japanese]

595
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,469
You definitely use these for walks, right?

596
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,471
-The leashes.
-Yes. And so we have--

597
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,682
we just need to put it somewhere.

598
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,267
[Marie speaking Japanese]

599
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,478
[Iida] So for the kitten
and doggie supplies,

600
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:49,691
I think using this whole section
for their items would be best.

601
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,402
Just hanging them right here
and putting the leash

602
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,946
will help identify this section.

603
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,035
[in Japanese] When tidying pet supplies,

604
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,121
it's important to create
a space for them.

605
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,957
Here's a tip for storing pet items.

606
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,250
For example,

607
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,835
you can put toys here.

608
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,170
This is a toy.

609
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,923
Leashes go here.
Grooming and food supplies here.

610
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,469
If you divide the space,
it'll look more tidy.

611
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:22,891
For dogs, you take them
on a walk every day

612
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:28,438
so you can put leashes on a hook
and put them on the wall.

613
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:31,274
I never got a chance
to use a leash like this

614
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:35,820
because I only had eel-like fish
as pets when I was little.

615
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,658
[Angela] You want to go
to the master bath?

616
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,493
-[Iida] Let's take a look.
-[Angela] Sure.

617
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:45,121
[Alishia] <i>The bathroom is kind of</i>
<i>a mixed-use space.</i>

618
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,040
Angela is a groomaholic.

619
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,249
So...

620
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:52,921
for instance, hairbrushes,
shampoos, conditioners...

621
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,131
The woman is insane.

622
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,258
[Angela]<i> My bathroom</i>
<i>needs to be organized.</i>

623
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,845
-I need to be an arm reach away from...
-She uses so many products.

624
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,056
...my brush and my gel
and my hair lotion.

625
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:06,559
"I need contact solution, I need this,
I need that, I need--" I'm like, "Oh."

626
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,561
I don't want anything
on the bathroom counter.

627
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,356
I like cohesiveness
and she just likes accessibility.

628
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:15,610
So these items here,
Angela uses these daily.

629
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,696
-Hmm.
-Along with...

630
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:18,988
[Iida translating]

631
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,824
...these, daily.

632
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,910
And then we have the makeup brushes

633
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,745
and lipsticks.

634
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,455
Oh, more hair stuff.

635
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,415
[Iida translating]

636
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,833
Oh, that's like my hair stuff.

637
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:30,875
[speaking Japanese]

638
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,837
[Iida] So, the point here
for storage in the bathroom

639
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,005
is to section it off with smaller boxes

640
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,757
and utilize the space that way.

641
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,009
-Game changer!
-[Angela] We need a lot of those.

642
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,052
[Marie] Yes.

643
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:44,222
-[Iida] Let's stack them.
-Game changer!

644
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:50,061
-I'm never gonna throw away a box again.
-[Alishia] Yeah, it makes sense now.

645
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,148
As soon as she put
that little box in there,

646
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,985
it all just came full circle.
I was like, "Ah!"

647
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,112
-I like that.
-Yeah.

648
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,449
Okay. We're moving on.

649
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:03,992
[Alishia] <i>Now with the bathroom,</i>

650
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,494
<i>even though we're in the same drawer</i>
<i>we're still separated.</i>

651
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,830
That way, it's not messy. You know, it's--

652
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,749
You still have your little bit of space.

653
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,126
-You want me to take something for you?
-[Iida translating]

654
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,377
[Marie] Thank you.

655
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,628
[Marie speaking Japanese]

656
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,381
The cool part
has definitely been organizing,

657
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,550
um, as opposed to kinda
letting go of things.

658
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,844
[Angela] <i>Since all of our stuff</i>
<i>was together,</i>

659
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,804
<i>I think, you know, we blended,</i>

660
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:30,226
<i>but now that we have our designated spaces</i>
<i>but we still have our communal things,</i>

661
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,228
everything else is just gonna
fall into place.

662
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:35,523
So we are going all drinkware here,

663
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,734
all food items here,

664
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,195
-and dishes are staying there.
-Yeah.

665
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,363
We work well together...

666
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,366
when we have a clear path.

667
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,118
Let's get to it, let's chop chop.

668
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,703
[Angela] Big, big.

669
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,830
Small, small.

670
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,832
The common goal was this is our home,

671
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,878
and we want it to be ease for both of us.

672
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,422
-[Angela] We like straws.
-[Alishia] Boxes. Bam.

673
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,467
High five. Mm.

674
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,970
We want to be able to move-- maneuver
without, you know, restrictions.

675
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:10,308
Now it's like all the things
that we love sparks that ding!

676
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,143
-The what?
-Ding!

677
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,269
[Angela laughing]

678
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,772
That's like my favorite thing, like...

679
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:16,815
Ding!

680
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,526
[Angela] It's all Alishia's stuff

682

I want a little corner,
that's all, to call my own.

683

-[Alishia] This is your corner.
-Yeah, it's my corner now.

Our biggest headache was her getting
her closet in order and then

685
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,996
me getting my closet in order.

686
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,707
And so once we got things separated
we can kind of do our own thing.

687
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,544
[Alishia] I've taken my things
out of the dresser,

688
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,672

Things had to get worse first...

692
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,975
before we started to really understand
what the process was about,

693
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:55,103
knowing that, you know,
we are doing this journey together,

694
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,773
but we do have an individual journey
that we need to take

695
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:02,151
before we kinda get together
and tackle the things that we...

696
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,112
co-own.

697
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,990
[Angela] I am exhausted
from a hard day's work.

698
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:10,869
Alishia, she's determined
to get this shelf in order.

-Do ya?
-I do.

703
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,670
I didn't think that was possible. [laughs]

704
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,089
You'd be surprised
what a little organization could do.

705
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,508
So obviously our wedding book,

706
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,094
wedding gift book, remember?

707
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:33,683
I think we kind of actually started
organizing in the same...

708
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,853
-you know, the same fashion now as well.
-Mm-hmm.

709
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,938
[Angela] Marie is gonna be so excited.

710
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,732
[Alishia] I hope she likes it.

711

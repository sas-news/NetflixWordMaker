00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,924
-Ah!
-[woman] She looks excited!

2
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:11,052
I'm so excited because I love mess.

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:14,347
[man] It's a never ending battle
to fight the clutter.

4
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,349
-[knocking]
-Oh!

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,019
I want things to be more simple.
I don't know how to fix it.

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,438
With the baby coming,
it's gonna be more chaos.

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,314
-[clattering]
-[gasping, squealing]

8
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,567
[man] Oh, my God! We have too much stuff!

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,028
Hello, I'm Marie Kondo.

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,279
[in Japanese] My mission

11
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,741
is to spark joy in the world
through cleaning.

12
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:33,950
Ching!

13
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,995
[narrator] <i>Best-selling author</i>
<i>and world-renowned tidying expert</i>

14
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:41,583
<i>Marie Kondo is dedicated to inspiring</i>
<i>the world to choose joy</i>

15
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,334
<i>with the KonMari Method.</i>

16
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,253
[in Japanese]
The KonMari Method is unique

17
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:48,256
<i>because I organize by category,</i>
<i>rather than by</i> location.

18
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:51,718
In the KonMari Method, we tidy
five categories in a specific order.

19
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,386
[in English] First, is clothing.

20
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,096
-[Marie grunting]
-[laughter]

21
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,264
I can't reach.

22
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,849
Next, is books.

23
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,852
[Iida] Giving them a little shake
and wake them up.

24
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,479
Then, paper.

25
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,438
[man sighs] I can't do the papers.

26
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,690
[deep groan]

27
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,027
The largest category is <i>komono.</i>

28
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,614
<i>Komono </i>is kitchen, bathroom,

29
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,740
and garage.

30
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,868
Everything miscellaneous.

31
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,163
Finally, sentimental items.

32
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,999
It's kinda hard to let it go,
'cause I really like this one.

33
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,212
[sniffling] This is kinda hard.

34
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:30,131
I don't want to just, you know, dump it.

35
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,093
But I want to be thoughtful about it.

36
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,554
[man 2] <i>From the moment she</i>
<i>set foot in our house,</i>

37
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,473
<i>she had this presence to her.</i>

38
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,767
She wants to see this place turned around.

39
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,895
Marie brought a whole bunch
of joy upon our home.

40
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,313
This is amazing.

41
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,440
[girl] You're so cute! I love you!

42
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,734
You're so cute.
I love you, too. [laughing]

43
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,028
These are, like, happy, happy tears.

44
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,197
Thank you for what you've brought
to our home, really.

45
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,959
[man] <i>You didn't see me</i>
<i>wash my hands before,</i>

46
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,961
but I want you to know
I washed my hands before.

47
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,419
-[man 2] Okay. Good.
-Okay.

48
00:02:09,503 --> 00:02:11,005
In case you were worried about that.

49
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,006
<i>Hi, my name's Frank,</i>

50
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,761
and I have lived in this happy home
for a little over two years now.

51
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,849
My name is Matt and I have lived here
a little over three years.

52
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:24,269
Oh, so it's not a happy home for you.
Okay. Alright. Cool.

53
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,940
[snickering] Thanks!

54
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,860
[Matt] I can never find
the spice that I want, ever.

55
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,989
Do you have any idea what artichokes
look like when they're done?

56
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,616
[Matt] They're just tender.
I don't know what they look like.

57
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,203
We are a classic love story.

58
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,998
We opened an app and swiped right.

59
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,333
-Mm-hmm.
-And that's, uh, how we met.

60
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,419
[Frank] <i>And Matt moved fast.</i>

61
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,088
<i>It was like, "Let's go on a date,"</i>
<i>and I'm like, "Okay, sure."</i>

62
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,632
<i>We went to this bar near my house</i>

63
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,009
and Matt goes to the bathroom,

64
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,595
he comes back and I'm like,
"Oh, do you want a second drink?"

65
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,139
He just grabbed my face and kisses me,
and I was like,

66
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,766
"Okay, okay." [laughing]

67
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,769
[Frank] <i>So we go back to my place</i>
<i>on Friday night.</i>

68
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,898
<i>Matt does not leave until Monday morning.</i>

69
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:13,484
<i>We keep canceling everything we have</i>
<i>so we can hang out with each other.</i>

70
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:17,822
<i>So, at the end of this 62-hour date,</i>
<i>we have said, "I love you,"</i>

71
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,158
<i>and said that we want to be</i>
<i>in a relationship</i>

72
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,743
<i>and stay together forever.</i>

73
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,453
For those keeping score at home,

74
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,539
this was after three dates
and a week and a half of dating.

75
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,583
We're still here three years later, so...

76
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,466
-[Frank] So, I talked to my mom...
-[Matt] Mm-hmm?

77
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,135
But what do we have to do
before they get here?

78
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,261
Um...

79
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,224
I don't know, just make
the place look presentable would be nice.

80
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,184
-That's a good start.
-[tap running]

81
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:49,520
My parents have not visited me
in California since I moved here,

82
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,022
actually, five years ago.

83
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,442
I love my family,
but I'm also really nervous

84
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,736
for them to come visit because...

85
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,947
<i>if you were to walk through our home,</i>

86
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,407
<i>you'd think</i>
<i>that college students live here.</i>

87
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,534
<i>We very rarely make the bed.</i>

88
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,373
[Matt] <i>Between us,</i>
<i>we accumulate a lot of stuff.</i>

89
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,668
[Frank] <i>I feel like both of us have things</i>
<i>from our college days</i>

90
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,253
<i>that are in our closets.</i>

91
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,380
Yours I'm more worried about.
Yours has melted cough drops on the floor.

92
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,134
Oh! That one came up. That's good.

93
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,011
-Busted! [laughing]
-Busted!

94
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,763
I'm proud of our place,

95
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:27,183
but it definitely can use
that extra oomph.

96
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,061
It's just not quite there. And, I yeah...

97
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,981
And I want it to be
before your parents get here.

98
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,067
Our home is
a reflection of our relationship.

99
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,069
[Matt] <i>So if our home isn't in harmony,</i>

100
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:41,281
<i>I feel like they might worry</i>
<i>that this might be just temporary.</i>

101
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,865
-So...
-Yeah, I could see that.

102
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,243
It'd be nice if it looked nice for them,
for sure.

103
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,912
[Frank] <i>My parents, they've met Matt,</i>
<i>they love him,</i>

104
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,707
<i>but just to see that, like,</i>
<i>the life we've created together</i>

105
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,625
<i>is something to be, like, admired.</i>

106
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,044
I think if they take our home seriously,

107
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,005
they'll be taking
our relationship seriously,

108
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,340
and that's what we want,
to make sure they know this is...

109
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,635
We're gonna be here for a while
and we're gonna be together forever.

110
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,932
[in Japanese] Tidying not only changes
your home or life,

111
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,477
but it also allows you to create a space
that suits your ideal self.

112
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,604
Frank and Matt are

113
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:17,942
a young couple wanting to live
a more mature lifestyle.

114
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:22,822
I am so happy to be able to support them
during their transition into adulthood.

115
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,008
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-[doorbell chiming]

116
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,804
-Hello.
-Hi.

117
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,805
Nice to meet you!

118
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,600
-Very nice to meet you.
-Hi, I'm Iida, Miss Marie's interpreter

119
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,727
-Sure, nice to meet you.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

120
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,354
-I'm Frank, this is Matt.
-Ah!

121
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,397
-Hello!
-Hi.

122
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,817
[speaking Japanese]

123
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,487
-It's very clean in here.
-[laughing]

124
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:03,988
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

125
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,033
-We wanted it to look clean for you.
-[laughing]

126
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,868
[speaking Japanese]

127
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,120
So I'd love to get a little bit of a tour
of your space.

128
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,413
-Of course.
-That'd be great.

129
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,040
[Frank] So, this is our living room.

130
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,292
We, uh, watch a lot of TV.

131
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,380
-We have all our board games here.
-[speaking Japanese]

132
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,091
Yeah, and some pictures,
postcards, and stuff.

133
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,469
Some books and we also have
all our DVDs are here...

134
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,846
-[Iida translating]
-...on those shelves with some books.

135
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,183
[Frank] <i>Every space I've ever had,</i>
<i>my parents referred to as a college dorm.</i>

136
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:35,520
<i>And so I don't know that I've given them</i>
<i>every reason to, like,</i>

137
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,355
<i>respect me as an adult.</i>

138
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,191
That's why I really want the place to...

139
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,403
look like someplace they can trust me
as an adult to live in.

140
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,822
And I want them to see, like,
we've got a handle on it.

141
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,116
-Mm-hmm.
-We're good, you raised us right.

142
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,660
Well, me, they didn't raise you.
But, yeah.

143
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,996
[Frank] I write at the desk a lot.

144
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,791
I'm a writer, too, so I usually,
will be just working here.

145
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,876
This is my sort of station here.

146
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,545
[speaking Japanese]

147
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,004
[Iida] What kind of writer are you?

148
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,589
I'm a TV comedy writer.

149
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,258
[speaking Japanese]

150
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,468
Do you guys work together?
You're-- As a pair?

151
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,470
-[laughing]
-Yeah. No. No.

152
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:13,057
I don't know if we want to put
that tension on our relationship.

153
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,143
[speaking Japanese]

154
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,645
-Still very neat here.
-[laughing]

155
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,564
[Matt] Oh, no. It'll get worse.
It'll get worse.

156
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,275
Okay. Well, before you decide that, um,

157
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:26,946
so we only have one closet in our bedroom,
so my closet's right here.

158
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,990
-[Iida translates]
-[speaking Japanese]

159
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,117
Yeah. Take a look. Please, go right ahead.

160
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,371
-Ah! [speaking Japanese]
-[Matt and Frank laughing]

161
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,124
[Frank] Yeah. Feel free. There isn't...

162
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,960
[Iida] Seems to be a lot of things
stuffed deep in there.

163
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,045
-There's a world in there, yeah.
-[speaking Japanese]

164
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,714
-[Iida] Wow, it's so deep.
-Yeah.

165
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,425
[Iida] I see there's a place to hang
clothes all the way in the back.

166
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,635
-[Frank] Yep, that there is.
-Oh, wow! Okay.

167
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,139
[all laughing]

168
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,142
[Iida speaking Japanese]

169
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,227
[speaking Japanese]

170
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,147
[Iida] Oh, wow. Look how deep it goes.
Yeah. Oh, my goodness!

171
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,440
[Marie speaking Japanese]

172
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,525
[Iida] In terms of storage space,
this is very nice.

173
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,568
[laughing]

174
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,903
[Marie speaking Japanese]

175
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,280
[Iida] So most of your clothes, Frank,
are in here?

176
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,783
In the room there is still a dresser
where I have, like, a lot of other stuff.

177
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,410
[speaking Japanese]

178
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,204
-Okay, the rest of the the…
-Sure, yeah.

179
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,706
[Frank] So, next, we have
the kitchen in here.

180
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,001
Our pantry is open,
so you can kind of see the chaos.

181
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,128
This is where we keep our dishes.

182
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,547
[Marie speaking Japanese]

183
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,008
[Iida] I see a little bit of clutter now.
Okay. Okay.

184
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,636
I think the kitchen might be
our most disorganized area.

185
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,554
-For sure.
-Yeah.

186
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,847
[Frank] <i>We'd accumulated stuff</i>
<i>over the years</i>

187
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,975
<i>because we had roommates come and go</i>

188
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:39,727
<i>and some people just left their stuff.</i>

189
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:42,688
<i>I hate the kitchen. I get out</i>
<i>of the kitchen as fast as possible.</i>

190
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:46,901
-And he loves food, so that's actually...
-So that's-- that's been hard.

191
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,861
Somebody who loves food
to just grab it and go.

192
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,447
He just runs into the kitchen
and grabs the snack and runs out.

193
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,199
Yeah, you'd think there were an egg timer,

194
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,701
and the floor would collapse
in a certain amount of time.

195
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,953
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

196
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,413
[Marie speaking Japanese]

197
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,041
-[Iida] I'm already getting a vision...
-[laughing]

198
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,126
...of how better its going to be.

199
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,045
So, I'm getting very excited.

200
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,339
[Matt] And then straight ahead
is the bedroom.

201
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,174
[speaking Japanese]

202
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,760
These are Frank's drawers here.

203
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,012
[Frank] They're all very stuffed full.

204
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,973
Uh, pants.

205
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,268
And also there used to be lots
of documents in here that I just got rid.

206
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,852
It was worse, if you can believe it.

207
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,479
-Ah!
-[Matt laughing]

208
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,730
[in Japanese] What about this?

209
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,567
-[Frank] Closet. It's pretty bad.
-[Iida] Closet.

210
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,151
[Marie speaking Japanese]

211
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,779
-[Iida] So, how is this separated?
-Well, this is just mine.

212
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,907
I'm the baby of my family,
so I think I've always been given

213
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,743
a little bit of slack
when it comes to, like, chores.

214
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,620
[Frank] <i>Definitely kept a messy room.</i>

215
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,163
<i>I rarely made my bed,</i>

216
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:45,167
<i>which might be part of the reason</i>
<i>why I am so cluttered right now.</i>

217
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,378
<i>I didn't really learn those good habits.</i>

218
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,130
But I've been the baby long enough

219
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,008
and I kind of need to move onto
that next stage.

220
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,428
Although those socks are mine
that you're seeing right in front of you.

221
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,096
Ah! [speaking Japanese]

222
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,932
[Iida] So, Frank, do you always
reach in here and get your socks?

223
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,060
This is new.
I used to have them in here, but--

224
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,647
It was an attempt to de-clutter this,
but it, uh... yeah.

225
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,983
<i>Growing up, whenever my mom</i>
<i>asked me to clean,</i>

226
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:12,153
I would just shove a bunch of paper
in my desk and be like, "It's clean."

227
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,488
And that's sort of
what we've done with our closets.

228
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,906
<i>They're overflowing.</i>

229
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,909
<i>There is some closets</i>
<i>we haven't looked at for a long time.</i>

230
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,871
<i>I'm organized in some aspects of my life,</i>
<i>like professionally.</i>

231
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,539
<i>my email inbox is organized. I'm great.</i>

232
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,875
And I just, like,
get frustrated with myself

233
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,044
that I haven't translated that
into into my home life.

234
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,713
It feels like I give it all at work
and I come home and I'm like--

235
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,089
[splatting noise]

236
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,383
[speaking Japanese]

237
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,177
[Iida] First thing I wanted to ask was

238
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,890
why the two of you felt that you wanted
to go on this tidying journey with me?

239
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,393
I think that we both have felt
that it's a little bit

240
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,854
dorm-like, it's a little bit adolescent.

241
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,815
And I think in particular is you saw
we're good at hiding things

242
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,651
that aren't organized,
so to the outside world

243
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,611
people walk in, and say,
"What's wrong with it?

244
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,072
But, like, we know what we aren't liking.

245
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,490
[speaking Japanese]

246
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,117
[Iida] Has your friends
or family often visit here?

247
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,745
My parents have come around
a couple of times,

248
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,081
but your parents haven't visited at all.

249
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,248
They are coming next month,

250
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,959
so it's especially important
to me to, like,

251
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,046
make the home someplace
that they feel, uh,

252
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,341
welcome as guests and not just as parents
who have to, like,

253
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,010
reorganize or clean or anything.
I want them to just to be here,

254
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,222
have a nice experience, and then go back
to where they came from. [laughing]

255
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,642
[Frank] <i>I don't feel actively judged</i>
<i>by my parents, but that being said,</i>

256
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,812
<i>I do feel like I have thrown them</i>
<i>a few curve balls.</i>

257
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,064
<i>I didn't go to medical school.</i>

258
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,901
I am in a gay relationship and...

259
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,569
um...

260
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,031
[emotional music playing]

261
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,575
[sighing]

262
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,745
I don't know why
I'm getting worked up about this.

263
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,956
They're very loving people, but, uh,...

264
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,376
you know, I don't know
that I've always, uh...

265
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,340
It's probably just in me again feeling
like I haven't always made them proud.

266
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,926
<i>I'm sure every kid</i>
<i>goes through that, being like,</i>

267
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:02,680
<i>"Oh, have I, like, justified my parents</i>
<i>having me and all the expenses."</i>

268
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:05,808
<i>But, yeah, I want them to see this home</i>
<i>and feel really like,</i>

269
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,185
<i>"We did everything we could for this kid</i>

270
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,772
<i>and he's really taken on everything</i>
<i>we taught him and...</i>

271
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,732
we love him."

272
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,359
It'd mean a lot for them to really be...

273
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,404
[sniffling] ...come in here
and see all that

274
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,864
that I'm feeling about this place.

275
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,326
I-- And that's a lot of a meaning
to attribute to a home, but...

276
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,911
it has that for me.

277
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,457
[speaking Japanese]

278
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,587
[Iida] Before we start, I want to first
introduce myself to the home.

279
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,130
If that's okay.

280
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,716
This is a ritual that I do
before we begin.

281
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,468
[Marie speaking Japanese]

282
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,719
I think this will do.

283
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,053
[speaking Japanese]

284
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,057
[Marie speaking Japanese]

285
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,227
[Iida] So, while I introduce myself,

286
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,772
I would love for you to picture
your vision for your home.

287
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,736
[peaceful music playing]

288
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,383
Okay. Very good.

289
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,302
[speaking Japanese]

290
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,179
Very good. Thank you so much.

291
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,265
[speaking Japanese]

292
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,645
[Iida] How did you feel
communicating with the home?

293
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,731
I think more so than anything
when I was concentrating,

294
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,817
there was, like, a feeling I had of, like,

295
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,653
just joy of, like, people walking through,

296
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,113
me being happy with how it was,
us being happy.

297
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,866
It's like I want to get that feeling.

298
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,284
[speaking Japanese]

299
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,537
[Iida] It's very important
to have a vision

300
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,248
and to communicate the vision
to your home.

301
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,668
It allows the rest of the process
to go much more smoothly.

302
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,211
[speaking Japanese]

303
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,712
[Iida] So, ready?

304
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,881
-Yeah.
-As ready as we're gonna be.

305
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:01,924
[laughing]

306
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,762
[speaking Japanese]

307
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:10,099
[Iida] Just around here.
Just keep it together as much as possible.

308
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,183
-Yeah.
-[Iida] Almost done.

309
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,143
-Okay. That's it.
-[Iida translating]

310
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,146
-[Iida] Very good. Well done!
-[Marie speaking Japanese]

311
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,816
[Iida] What do you think looking at
all the clothes that you own?

312
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,776
There's so many I don't wear or need.

313
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,238
Definitely looks like a lot more
when I see it piled in one place.

314
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,447
[Marie speaking Japanese]

315
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,032
[Iida] So what we'll be doing

316
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,660
is you'll be going through all
of your clothes one by one

317
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:33,330
and selecting only the clothes
that spark joy for you.

318
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,957
What does "spark joy" mean for you?

319
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,584
[Marie speaking Japanese]

320
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,379
[Iida] Oh, for me "spark joy" is all about
how my body reacts.

321
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,465
So when you hold an item in your hands
that sparks joy for you,

322
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,301
this is how your body should react.

323
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,635
-[Frank chuckling]
-Ching!

324
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,721
-Do you understand?
-Yeah. Yeah.

325
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,307
[Iida] The cute sound that she made
that I'm not gonna translate.

326
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,434
[Marie speaking Japanese]

327
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,854
[Iida] Is there anything that you see
in here that clearly sparks joy for you?

328
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,106
-Yes, definitely.
-[Iida] Let's try touching that.

329
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,069
[Marie and Iida laughing]

330
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,487
[Iida] That is really cute.

331
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,823
[Marie speaking Japanese]

332
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,743
You also should envision
as you go through the selection process.

333
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,871
Like, what do you see yourself wearing
that will make you feel

334
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,832
more mature and grown-up?

335
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,459
So before I visit next time,

336
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,878
please finish,
complete all of your clothes.

337
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,673
This feels like kinda like the last step
to get us to being adults.

338
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,593
[Matt]
<i>And I think we just need that last push.</i>

339
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,304
<i>Like, that push out of the nest</i>
<i>that the mama bird does.</i>

340
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,306
Hopefully Marie can be our mama bird.

341
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,434
I've actually watched <i>Planet Earth,</i>
that doesn't actually happen.

342
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,311
No bird pushes their children
out the nest.

343
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,271
-You're ruining my metaphor.
-I am, but...

344
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,357
but the point stands, uh, yeah.

345
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,193
We need a last bit
of energy and we're gonna get it here.

346
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,110
Uh-huh.

347
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,029
-Thank you so much, guys.
-Thank you.

348
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:47,947
Bye.

349
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,324
-See you soon. Bye.
-See you soon.

350
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,036
[Frank sighing]

351
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,170
Do I like this? Eh...

352
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,005
Thank you.

353
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:10,761
See, I feel like I have more socks,
even in my yes collection than you.

354
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,180
I didn't throw out that many,
though, in all honestly.

355
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,723
I just guess I don't have as many.

356
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:21,730
I'm having trouble connecting to the idea
of items of clothing sparking joy.

357
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:26,527
See, so far this is everything
I'm keeping here.

358
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,529
I've felt joy from all of it.

359
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,991
[Matt] <i>I definitely was</i>
<i>an over achiever at school.</i>

360
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,828
Gotten As and I've always grasped
concepts really quickly.

361
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,622
Didn't have to study like a super ton.

362
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,208
<i>So when I'm not getting</i>
<i>the concept right away,</i>

363
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,960
<i>it's kind of like a disconnect of, like...</i>

364
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,673
Like, I'm usually good at this,
what am I-- what am I doing wrong?

365
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,884
I have a few items
that really, like, speak to me,

366
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,636
but then I have a lot that

367
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,305
don't speak negatively,
but don't speak positively.

368
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,099
I feel like are in-- in the in-between.

369
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,602
My policy for that is sort of like
if the answer isn't yes, it's no.

370
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,229
I know. That's what it should be.

371
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,857
What I've noticed is the stuff
that sparks joy, like,

372
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,652
I honestly have that like, "Oh!" reaction
that Marie was talking about.

373
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,320
I do have it with some of my clothes,
but not...

374
00:17:11,946 --> 00:17:15,534
a lot, and that's why I'm not filtering
as well as you, probably.

375
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,037
I'm not really listening to myself.

376
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,665
[Matt] <i>I'm not always</i>
<i>emotionally available.</i>

377
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,500
<i>I'm not the most emotional person.</i>

378
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:27,003
<i>Ever since I've been little</i>
<i>I've been shy and, like,</i>

379
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:30,090
<i>I've had a few close friends</i>
<i>that I'm really close with,</i>

380
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,134
<i>but then everyone else, not so much.</i>

381
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:35,929
<i>Sometimes I can seem cold</i>
<i>and a little bit distant to people,</i>

382
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:40,392
<i>so kind of just opening up</i>
<i>as the process goes along</i>

383
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,728
would be a good first
stepping stone to that.

384
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,229
I think I need to...

385
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,273
re-focus.

386
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,984
I think I've gotten a little too--
a little bogged down

387
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,153
and have become a little precious.

388
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,322
Yeah, I feel like
if you're not sure, you keep it.

389
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,074
Yeah. That's fair.

390
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,368
When I get to the ties,
I might ask you to weigh in

391
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,913
because I feel like you have
a good sense of color,

392
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:05,125
and I don't want to throw away something
where I'm just inaccurately assessing

393
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,169
what I can pair it with.

394
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:17,346
[in Japanese] Neckties are important
accessories for men.

395
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:20,641
So let's store them with respect.

396
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,810
[speaking Japanese]

397
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,537
[in Japanese] Store neckties in boxes

398
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,456
to keep them organized.

399
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,333
[speaking Japanese]

400
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,888
[doorbell chiming]

401
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,225
-[Marie] Hi!
-Hi!

402
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,602
-Hi. Nice to see you again.
-Nice to see you again!

403
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,980
-Nice to see you.
-Good to see you!

404
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,190
-Hi. Nice to see you.
-Hi. Good to see you.

405
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,651
-[speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] Is that what I think it is?

406
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,570
-What you're letting go?
-[Frank] Yes.

407
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:18,073
-[speaking Japanese]
-That is a great amount. Very well done.

408
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,158
[Marie speaking Japanese]

409
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,161
[Iida] And let's tackle the books
and paper categories next.

410
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,078
-Yeah.
-Yes!

411
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,496
[laughing]

412
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,376
[speaking Japanese]

413
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:34,089
[Iida] So let's take out every single book
from the house and collect it in one spot.

414
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,716
Is that yours? No, it's mine.

415
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,846
[speaking Japanese]

416
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,849
[Iida] So, the process is the same
with clothes.

417
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:48,020
Take every single book into your hands
and see if it sparks joy for you.

418
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,565
How do you fold the books, though?
I don't see how that works.

419
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,234
[in Japanese] Books, you don't fold.

420
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,111
-You read them.
-[laughing]

421
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,571
[Iida translating]

422
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,072
[speaking Japanese]

423
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:02,534
[Iida] But with books, you also want
to ask this question to yourself.

424
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:06,496
By having these books, will it be
beneficial to your life going forward?

425
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,374
[Marie, in Japanese]
<i>Books are the reflection</i>

426
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:14,087
of our thoughts and values.

427
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,465
<i>So by tidying books,</i>

428
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,343
<i>it will show you what kind of information</i>

429
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,554
is important to you at this moment.

430
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,349
-[Frank] Good over there, yeah.
-[speaking Japanese]

431
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,517
Which one is this? Spark joy or no?

432
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,061
-Definitely, yes.
-[Iida translating]

433
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,646
-[speaking Japanese]
-Okay.

434
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,105
Thank you.

435
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,690
[in English] Thank you.

436
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,277
Thank you.

437
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:46,954
[Marie speaking Japanese]

438
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,706
[Iida] Is this difficult for you,
going through the books?

439
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,791
[Matt] Uh...

440
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,292
Yeah.

441
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,710
[speaking Japanese]

442
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,629
[Iida] I assume you always love to read.

443
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,048
[Matt] Uh, yeah, ever since I was a kid.

444
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,842
Like, when the Scholastic Book Fair
would come to our school

445
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,970
that was, like,
the biggest day of the year.

446
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,304
[speaking Japanese]

447
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,391
[Iida] What's your number one book
that you will never let go?

448
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,142
-Is there such a book?
-I think...

449
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,938
<i>To Kill A Mockingbird</i> really sparked
with me and connected

450
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,023
back in high school when I first read it.

451
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,400
[speaking Japanese]

452
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,944
-[Iida] Will you try touching that for me?
-[Matt] Mm-hmm.

453
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,029
[gentle music playing]

454
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,493
Yeah, definitely, like,

455
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:29,746
I can remember reading it in high school
for the first time.

456
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,082
Um, yeah,

457
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:35,127
it's a def-- It's like a for sure,
like, just immediate.

458
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,298
[speaking Japanese]

459
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,133
[Iida] Books like that
are very useful for you

460
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,719
because that's the spark of joy
that you should be feeling.

461
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,636
Mm-hmm.

462
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,515
<i>To Kill A Mockingbird</i>
really inspired me a lot.

463
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:51,893
I still read it about once
every two years.

464
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:52,978
Um...

465
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,647
And, uh, I just...

466
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,650
really connected to the characters
and it really inspired me

467
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,652
to want to be a writer myself.

468
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,573
Um, so when I hold this,
I kind of feel this warm sensation,

469
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:09,036
<i>and it slowly dawned on me just, like,</i>

470
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,996
"Oh, this is what you're supposed
to be feeling

471
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,581
when you have that spark of joy."

472
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,791
<i>The ones that I didn't feel connection to,</i>

473
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,878
<i>it was immediately clear</i>
<i>that I was ready to let those ones go.</i>

474
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,296
[Marie speaking Japanese]

475
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,090
[Iida] I think that you really honed
your sensitivity to joy

476
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,800
through going through these books.

477
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,635
-Yes.
-I definitely feel that way.

478
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,347
I think with books I feel more
of a connection

479
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,142
than I do with clothes, where I'm just
trying to, like, look decent,

480
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,353
and I don't put that much energy into it.

481
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,688
Where books I've spent the time with them,

482
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,482
so I'm more connected to them.

483
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,484
[in Japanese]
<i>The moment you realize what it means</i>

484
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,570
to spark joy comes to people
at different times.

485
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:48,241
As you continue to tidy,
your sensitivity to joy will be honed.

486
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,535
So there will be an "aha" moment

487
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,663
when you realize what it means
for something to spark joy.

488
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,375
<i>So even though you decided</i>
<i>to keep items now,</i>

489
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,460
<i>you may feel that you want to</i>

490
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:02,547
revisit those items again
later on in the tidying process.

491
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,050
[Frank] I'm done, so... [laughing]

492
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,594
-[speaking Japanese]
-All done. Oh, my goodness!

493
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,596
You can move on to
the next category, actually.

494
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,599
So can you make a pile of paper
on the dining room table?

495
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,934
You bet I can.

496
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,602
[Iida translates]
[in English] Thank you.

497
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:23,777
And done.

498
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,320
-Oh! Well done.
-Thank you.

499
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,907
And now you can see Frank's paper mess
that he's just starting on.

500
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,660
-[Iida] Oh, and he's still going.
-[Frank] I heard that!

501
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,579
Frank does not let go of any papers.

502
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,374
[Matt] <i>He still has notes</i>
<i>from, like, high school,</i>

503
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:41,294
<i>and he puts a lot of emotion</i>
<i>and memories in those notes.</i>

504
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,671
I'm aware of my problem, I guess,

505
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,589
because I see them stored
all over the house.

506
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,967
<i>So I knew the amount was too high,</i>

507
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,720
but in order to veil that from myself,
I increased the number of locations.

508
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:54,099
I get very sentimental about cards.

509
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,269
Yeah, well this one I'm keeping for sure.

510
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:00,564
So this is, like, sort of history
into why I started writing.

511
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:03,358
There was a bunch of, like,
<i>Power Rangers </i>fan fiction.

512
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,734
-[Marie] Ah!
-[Iida translating]

513
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:05,777
Scrap in here.

514
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,279
[speaking Japanese]

515
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,948
[Iida] How old were you
when you wrote those?

516
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,784
So this goes back
from when I was a teenager to, like...

517
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,703
this was just a couple years ago.

518
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:19,583
<i>I have a great appreciation</i>
<i>for my childhood.</i>

519
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,586
I grew up very happy in my house,
and as a result I've kept a lot

520
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:26,506
<i>of like, you know, little drawings I had,</i>
<i>even from, like, age eight or something,</i>

521
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,177
and I've kept those just for, like,
inspiration and comfort and warmth

522
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,346
and I'm worried that, like,
I'll want to hang on to everything.

523
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,349
I feel like for me,
this actually might be the hardest.

524
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,143
[speaking Japanese]

525
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,645
[Iida] Discovering what's
difficult for you

526
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,148
is just the whole point
of this process, too,

527
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,358
which is understanding what sparks joy.

528
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,569
It's the things that are
the most meaningful to you

529
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,570
that are the hardest.

530
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,198
He loves books
and I love just writing a lot, so...

531
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,700
[Marie speaking Japanese]

532
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,245
[Iida] The trick to keeping
paper documents in order

533
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,873
is to have a designated spot in the house.

534
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:08,715
[in Japanese] Papers you decide to keep
can be divided into three categories.

535
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,677
The first category is pending documents.

536
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,847
Pending documents are papers

537
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,767
that are waiting for you

538
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:23,563
to take action upon,
such as letters and bills.

539
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,609
The second category
is important documents.

540
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,821
Important documents are papers

541
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:36,034
that you need to keep  permanently,

542
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:40,580
such as contracts and insurance forms.

543
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,000
The last category is
miscellaneous documents.

544
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:49,923
Miscellaneous documents are papers
that you refer to often,

545
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,259
such as recipe cutouts from magazines,

546
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:56,096
or papers from a seminar you attended

547
00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:01,851
that you frequently go back to read.

548
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,150
Oh, boy. I wrote some
angsty songs in college.

549
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,612
But, like, on a serious note,

550
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,489
I think I started songwriting when I was,

551
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,450
like, coming to terms with, like,
having gay feelings,

552
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,869
and I didn't kinda get it yet.

553
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,208
It got me through some hard times
writing songs, so, huh.

554
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,502
You're ready to let that go?

555
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,338
[sighing]
Part of me feels like I should save these.

556
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,216
<i>I attribute a lot of emotional value</i>
<i>to papers,</i>

557
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,094
like, because even today,
going through them, I was like,

558
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:39,472
"Oh, this was the first script I wrote
that, like, did well in a competition.

559
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:43,351
This is, like, when I first had
my creative inklings about this concept,"

560
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,895
and so it's hard for me to let things go.

561
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,065
That's funny.
Now I wonder if I should keep it.

562
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,652
[deep groan]

563
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,697
-[resigned sigh] I can't do the papers.
-They're all yours.

564
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,867
I like papers. I've always liked papers.

565
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,536
-I just like...
-I think it's really just about

566
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:07,542
what-- like, the ones that really you feel
like are particularly sparking your joy.

567
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:13,298
I love Matt and want the best for him,
but, man,

568
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:16,217
<i>there is like a total flip</i>
<i>from, like, clothing to papers</i>

569
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,886
<i>that I was not anticipating.</i>

570
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:21,097
<i>I totally understand</i>
<i>his frustration before,</i>

571
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,893
and it doesn't feel good to be
the one at the back of the class.

572
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,646
You want to feel like
you're really taking it on.

573
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,066
I sorted the mail already,
so this is your new mail right here.

574
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,901
-Great. Thank you, Matthew.
-Yep.

575
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,277
-Appreciate this.
-You're welcome.

576
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,080
-[doorbell chiming]
-[Marie speaking Japanese]

577
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,457
-Hi.
-Hi!

578
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,668
-Nice to see you.
-Hi, Marie. Nice to see you again.

579
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,585
Come on in.

580
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,046
-Oh, we have gifts! Exciting!
-Yes.

581
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,465
Yes. We have a lot of boxes.

582
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,092
Oh! Perfect. Okay.

583
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,302
[Marie speaking Japanese]

584
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:02,722
[Iida] So today's category will be
miscellaneous items.

585
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,560
[Frank] <i>I'm a catastrophizer,</i>

586
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,605
<i>and it means to prepare for</i>
<i>the worst case scenario doomsday,</i>

587
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,399
<i>but, like, at all times.</i>

588
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,485
Someone who catastrophizes,
it's a problem in your home

589
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,278
because you think,
"What if I need this one?"

590
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,280
You just sort of keep everything.

591
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,615
<i>But then it's ultimately useless</i>

592
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,909
<i>'cause you don't</i>
<i>remember where it is when you need it.</i>

593
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,953
[clattering]

594
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:28,915
Do we have an earthquake kit
at all prepared?

595
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:29,958
-[laughing]
-No.

596
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,420
No, nothing
that for an actual emergency.

597
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,589
Matt, I'm gonna make a box of stuff
that I don't think I need,

598
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,300
-but I want your opinion on it, too.
-[Matt] Okay.

599
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,221
[Marie, in Japanese]
Do you know what all these cords are for?

600
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,683
Some of them I can. A lot of them I can't.

601
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,811
A lot of them I'm not sure why
they were in there in the first place.

602
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,062
[speaking Japanese]

603
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:54,399
[Iida] I was thinking we could use one
of these drawers for electronics.

604
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,442
[Matt] Okay.

605
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,406
[in Japanese]
Out of the miscellaneous items,

606
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,659
electronic gadgets tend to become a mess.

607
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:09,289
When tidying miscellaneous items,

608
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,374
combine in small boxes to
compartmentalize the items.

609
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,544
Small items such as USB drives and
memory cards

610
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,838
will look tidier when stored
standing upright.

611
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:20,592
The goal is to store everything in a way

612
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,345
where you can see everything
with one look.

613
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,891
Thank you.

614
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:28,933
[speaking Japanese]

615
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,060
What kind of things are you letting go
would you say?

616
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:36,357
Um, just random things that were,
like, boxes for electronics a lot. Um...

617
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,444
From my first visit
to Disneyland out here.

618
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,571
I just don't think I need it.

619
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,783
-Oh, I'm torn. Matt, I'm too sentimental.
-[Matt laughing]

620
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,368
Never mind, I take it back,
it brings me joy.

621
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,078
Thank you.

622
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,331
[Marie speaking Japanese]

623
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,374
-[IIda] Look at you, Matt.
-[Matt] It's a lot less.

624
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,043
[Iida] You've made such huge progress.

625
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,087
Thank you.

626
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,632
[emotional music playing]

627
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:05,428
[Frank] <i>I feel guilty, because I see</i>
<i>how much work Matt is doing</i>

628
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,848
<i>and I feel like I'm not helping him.</i>

629
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,851
[deep exhale]

630
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,812
<i>Ever since the paper assignment,</i>

631
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,314
<i>I have this block against</i>
<i>letting go of things.</i>

632
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:20,318
<i>And that triggers some disappointment</i>
<i>in myself and...</i>

633
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,779
[sighing]

634
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,076
[birds chirping]

635
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,540
-Pfft. Hey.
-Hey.

636
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:37,836
I'm done with the, uh,
Christmas and holiday drawer.

637
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,712
-love you.
-I love you, too.

638
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,257
Alright. I think I'm feeling
a little anxious 'cause I feel like

639
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,802
we haven't gotten rid of anything yet
and it's making me a little...

640
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,096
-Yes.
-...feel crowded, I guess.

641
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,516
Frank is usually the more outgoing person,
the person with more energy,

642
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:56,104
so when he, um,
is feeling a little bit less...

643
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,605
self-confident,

644
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,984
<i>it definitely puts a damper on things.</i>

645
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,778
<i>Just because his energy</i>
<i>feeds into my energy.</i>

646
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:08,074
Feel like I'm really glad my parents
aren't coming for another, what,

647
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,742
like, week and a half?

648
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,620
-Mm-hmm.
-Because we are not ready at all.

649
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,415
<i>So just trying to stay positive</i>

650
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:18,918
and help inspire him
'cause he did that for me during clothes.

651
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:24,591
-Medium plates, do we need 12? To...
-No. It feels extreme.

652
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,426
We don't need to throw out
just to throw out.

653
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,678
-Like I'm fine having nine.
-No, if it sparks your joy.

654
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,680
It's not the number and--

655
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,724
No, but I'm-- [sighing]

656
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:33,683
[blows raspberry]

657
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,810
I meant using the number
as, like, a guideline.

658
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,020
Yeah, yeah.

659
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,815
[Frank] <i>Matt can be a little</i>
<i>quieter sometime,</i>

660
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:45,028
<i>so to see him projecting opinions</i>
<i>so openly about the home,</i>

661
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:48,114
<i>it made me really happy and inspired</i>

662
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:51,409
that I wanted to, you know,
keep up with him,

663
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:54,871
and not like-- especially because
he was experiencing a positive moment,

664
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,290
I didn't want to take away
from it by being, like,

665
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:00,752
you know, sad sack, so I was like, "Okay,
I have to kind of muscle through this."

666
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,087
[Frank] I find myself gravitating
towards these,

667
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,881
perfectly honest, but how do you feel?

668
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:08,968
We don't use small plates all that often,
so this would be an extreme amount.

669
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,346
So I'm good letting these go.

670
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,847
-Okay.
-Thank you.

671
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,018
I don't like either of these,
so I'm good with these leaving.

672
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,604
Thank you.

673
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,690
[Frank] Twenty, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26.

674
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,275
-[Matt] Yeah.
-We have 26 mugs.

675
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,486
Thirteen for each.
That seems totally reasonable.

676
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,363
For two people. [laughing]

677
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:32,492
In some ways I think, like, having ties
to childhood makes you less of an adult,

678
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,327
<i>so it's incumbent upon me</i>
<i>to know, like,</i>

679
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,704
what really is valuable and meaningful,

680
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,875
and what I'm just sort of afraid
to not hold onto anymore.

681
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,336
I think fear isn't a good reason
to hold onto things.

682
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,672
It should be, you know,
something positive, like happiness.

683
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,174
Plastic knives.
I don't know if people really use knives.

684
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:50,969
Knives we have a ton of.
I think let it go, let it go.

685
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,680
Yeah. I don't feel like we ever cook
a quantity of food large enough

686
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,932
that we'd really need this. Thank you.

687
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,434
[Matt] <i>I'm definitely proud of Frank.</i>

688
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,937
<i>He puts a lot of memories</i>
<i>into these things,</i>

689
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,606
<i>so it wasn't easy for him</i>
<i>letting go of stuff.</i>

690
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:08,236
But now I feel like we're both finally
on the road to adulthood.

691
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:13,700
[Frank] Oh, yeah. We're gonna make
some people very happy today.

692
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:14,951
[Frank] Where are we going?

693
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:22,125
We're going to Out of the Closet
to donate our clothes.

694
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,127
<i>And other objects.</i>

695
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,171
[Frank] <i>I feel like we're on</i>
<i>the homeward stretch.</i>

696
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,924
<i>Like, it feels like we've conquered</i>
<i>so much in the house already,</i>

697
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,176
<i>like, getting through some</i>
<i>of the miscellanea today</i>

698
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,804
<i>made me feel like,</i>
<i>"Okay, we're, like, coming on the end.</i>

699
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,723
<i>Knowing I have this home that, like,</i>

700
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:39,642
is getting to where I want it to get
and will eventually

701
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,270
is just, like, giving me an extra boost

702
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,272
that I'm-- for which I'm very grateful.

703
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:48,860
We are off to Goodwill to donate the rest!

704
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:52,989
And I think that will be it,
believe it or not.

705
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,493
[upbeat music playing]

706
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,372
[Marie speaking Japanese]

707
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,376
[doorbell chiming]

708
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,713
-Hello.
-[Marie] Hi!

709
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:10,047
-Hi.
-Nice to see you.

710
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,884
Nice to see you, Marie!
Hi, Iida, nice to see you again!

711
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,053
-Hi. Nice to see you guys.
-Hi.

712
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,388
-[speaking Japanese]
-How was homework?

713
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,766
A lot, but we actually got
all the way through it, yep.

714
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,062
-[speaking Japanese]
-Oh my gosh! Let's go see it! Can't wait!

715
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,605
-Lead the way.
-Okay.

716
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,232
Here it is.

717
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,777
-[Matt] <i>Linen closet.</i>
<i>-</i>[Frank] <i>Linen closet.</i>

718
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,322
[Marie speaking Japanese]

719
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,657
[Iida] <i>Oh, my goodness!</i>
<i>Look at how neat it looks!</i>

720
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,658
[Frank] <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

721
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,078
<i>[Matt] And it's washcloths</i>
<i>and hand towels.</i>

722
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,205
[Marie, in English] <i>Oh! Beautiful!</i>

723
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,748
[Iida] <i>So beautiful!</i>

724
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,248
<i>Breathtaking.</i>

725
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,751
[speaking Japanese]

726
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:49,754
[Iida] This makes it so much easier
to see where everything is.

727
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,882
Before everything was, like, exploding
out of it. It feels much easier now.

728
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:56,177
[Frank] <i>I feel really good. I, like, want</i>
<i>to invite a lot of people over now,</i>

729
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,096
<i>so I can, like, open up the closets,</i>

730
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,181
<i>be like, "See how organized we are?</i>
<i>Look at this."</i>

731
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,100
<i>I'm growing up and moving on</i>

732
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,227
and this is the time
where I think we're gonna

733
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,229
have a home that we're very proud of.

734
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,730
[speaking Japanese]

735
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:11,234
[Iida] Wonderful. Okay, let's go
to the kitchen. Can't wait to see.

736
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:16,197
[Matt] <i>So we reorganized,</i>
<i>and sorted all the food,</i>

737
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,493
<i>and made this our kind of breakfast area</i>
<i>with our coffee maker and toaster.</i>

738
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:23,246
-[Marie speaking Japanese]
-[Iida] <i>It looks like a store.</i>

739
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,872
<i>-Oh my gosh!</i>
-[Matt and Frank laughing]

740
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,835
I feel like I am the adult
that I'm presenting to the world.

741
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:32,255
[Matt] <i>I'm not hiding my messy</i>
<i>true self anymore.</i>

742
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,342
<i>We are stronger for doing this because,</i>

743
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,845
you know, it challenged both of us
in different ways.

744
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:42,723
I had to sort of let go of some things
to which I was clinging,

745
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,476
<i>and Matt over time learned</i>
<i>to, like, vocalize his emotions.</i>

746
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,855
<i>So, I think it helped us</i>
<i>address things within our self.</i>

747
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:53,401
I definitely feel like I've become
more emotionally open,

748
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,153
<i>and I finally felt that, like,</i>

749
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:58,573
<i>"Wow, like, I really am feeling</i>
<i>that spark of joy."</i>

750
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,869
<i>I did want to have that feeling</i>
<i>and bring it through the rest of my life</i>

751
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,663
because you're just
a happier person, honestly.

752
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,331
[speaking Japanese]

753
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,834
So how do you feel now
that you've reached the end?

754
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:13,087
I'm very proud of our home
and happy with, uh, the work we've done,

755
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,964
and really grateful for you teaching us.

756
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,632
[Marie speaking Japanese]

757
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,093
[Iida] <i>Yeah. I believe your parents</i>
<i>will be pretty shocked</i>

758
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,179
<i>to see how tidy this home is.</i>

759
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,181
-[Frank] <i>"Shocked" is the word.</i>
-[Matt chuckling]

760
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,058
[Frank] <i>It really feels like</i>
<i>our lives are changed</i>

761
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,269
<i>because you came and helped us,</i>
<i>so thank you.</i>

762
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:31,898
[Matt] I don't think it would've been done
if you hadn't come in here and helped us.

763
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,774
[speaking Japanese]

764
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,818
[Iida] I'm so glad to hear that.
Thank you.

765
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,362
<i>I think my parents are gonna be</i>
<i>really happy with what they see</i>

766
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:42,033
and they're gonna feel that we've really
created this home for ourselves

767
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:45,119
<i>as adults, which makes me</i>
<i>very happy to think about.</i>

768
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,204
-Keep in touch.
-Thank you.

769
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,121
Bye!

770
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,122
[Frank] Thank you.

771
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,042
-I'm sad to see her go.
-Oh!

772
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,086
-[Matt] You miss her already.
-[Frank] Mm-hmm.

773
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:58,299
I think Frank's parents are not
gonna be worried about him

774
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:02,053
being with me 'cause
this place looks so nice, so...

775
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,013
In large part to you, so...

776
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,432
And you. It was a team effort.

777
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,692
I suppose you're not nervous at all
'cause they're not your parents.

778
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,070
[Matt] I am nervous.
I want them to like it, of course I do.

779
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,745
Ah, Matt, I got a tiny fleck
of beet on me.

780
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,914
Oh, it's fine. That's barely--

781
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:30,915
-You sure?
-Yeah.

782
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,416
Don't put water on it

783
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,835
'cause that's gonna look wet
when your parents get here.

784
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,045
[Frank grumbling]

785
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,215
<i>This visit from my parents</i>
<i>is a big thing for me</i>

786
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:42,426
because this home is a symbol of my, uh...

787
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,304
my relationship with Matt
and my relationship with my parents,

788
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,806
<i>my relationship with the world.</i>

789
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,350
So it's vital that they like
what they see.

790
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,435
[doorbell chiming]

791
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,022
[Frank seething]

792
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:55,940
Okay.

793
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,068
-Hi.
-Hi, Frankie!

794
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,028
Hi. How are you?

795
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,863
-Wow!
-[Frank laughing]

796
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,073
Hi.

797
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,909
It looks really nice!

798
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,869
This isn't what I was expecting.

799
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,538
I thought I'd show you guys everything

800
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,581
just 'cause we've been doing
a lot of folding,

801
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,042
and sort of compartmentalizing
techniques with Marie.

802
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,503
-Oh, I love that.
-And this is our dining room.

803
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,339
-How pretty.
-[Frank] Then I can show you my closet.

804
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,467
-It was very disorganized until recently.
-[Patty]  Well, this I gotta see.

805
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,927
-Yeah, this is it.
-Wow!

806
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,762
We got all my shirts,

807
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,264
my sweaters.

808
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,598
Oh, this is cute.

809
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,393
I'm gonna reheat the chicken for you guys.
That's a cake for later.

810
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,353
-You cooked for us?
-It wasn't-- Of course I did!

811
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:38,232
Anyhoo, so, yeah, we have just
a limited number of pots and pans,

812
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,650
so you can grab what you need.

813
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,236
And then we tried to pare down
how many things we have.

814
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,823
That way we have, like, you know,
our mugs, our cups, our plates, our bowls.

815
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,325
[Patty] That looks really nice.

816
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,618
Frankie has never failed us.

817
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,330
He is a wonderful, wonderful guy.

818
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,875
[Patty] <i>He's one of those guys</i>
<i>that always does the right thing</i>

819
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,044
<i>and makes the right decisions in life.</i>

820
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,379
And I'm very happy he's my son.

821
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:03,466
What I'm most proud about Frankie
and what he's done

822
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,094
is that he's matured as a person,

823
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:12,141
and it shows in how he's living
and how he's organized his life.

824
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,727
Imagine that you've had a son
living with you,

825
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,687
and you see his room,

826
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,439
<i>which wasn't the best.</i>

827
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:22,568
And then you see him in college,
which really was bad. [chuckling]

828
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:26,947
<i>And now to see a difference</i>
<i>tells me that he went forward.</i>

829
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,324
I'm very proud of him.

830
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,161
Down here are sort of some accessories.

831
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,537
-Oh, wow!
-Oh, wow!

832
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,831
-I love the way that looks!
-[Frank Sr.] Look at the ties.

833
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:39,710
-This one I like. I can take that one.
-No. No. No.

834
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:44,131
<i>The fact that he and Matt,</i>
<i>as a partnership,</i> <i>agreed to do this,</i>

835
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,342
it just makes you
feel good about the two of them.

836
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,970
I'd love to see them together
for a long time,

837
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,722
'cause they're really good partners.

838
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:54,475
Are you guys hungry?
Do you want us to serve you lunch?

839
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,519
-Did Matt supervise?
-I supervised.

840
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,396
Okay, I feel better. I'll eat it, yeah.

841
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,689
-Great. Let's go to the kitchen.
-Let's go to the kitchen.

842
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,901
They said everything I wanted them to say
without being prompted,

843
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,653
-which made me so happy.
-No prompting.

844
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:06,570
I know.

845
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,322
<i>[Matt] I've always been proud</i>
<i>of the place,</i>

846
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,700
<i>but now it's just like tenfold</i>
<i>of what I was feeling before,</i>

847
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,786
<i>and it's nice to just see</i>

848
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:16,872
<i>such a positive reaction</i>
<i>from your parents, for sure.</i>

849
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,333
I feel our union is very, um,

850
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,419
you know, respected by them, and...

851
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,045
Not that I didn't believe in it before,

852
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,047
but it's always good
to have family on your side.

853
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,091
And here's a toast to the two of you.

854
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,969
May you always be happy in this house

855
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,929
and everywhere else that you live.

856
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,014
-[Frank] <i>Thank you.</i>
-[Frank Sr.] <i>God bless you both.</i>
